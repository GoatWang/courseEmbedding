Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc. and Western Asset Global High Income Fund Inc. Announce Board Approval of Proposed Merger Plan | Business Wire


























































Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc. and Western Asset 
      Global High Income Fund Inc. Announce Board Approval of Proposed Merger 
      Plan






November 16, 2015 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: GDF) and Western 
      Asset Global High Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: EHI) today announced approval 
      by each Fund’s Board of Directors of a proposal to merge Western Asset 
      Global Partners Income Fund Inc. with and into Western Asset Global High 
      Income Fund Inc., subject to approval by the stockholders of each Fund. 
      If approved, the merger is anticipated to occur during the second 
      quarter of 2016.
    

      Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc. and Western Asset Global 
      High Income Fund Inc. have similar investment objectives. Western Asset 
      Global Partners Income Fund Inc.’s primary investment objective is to 
      maintain a high level of current income and its secondary objective is 
      to seek capital appreciation. Western Asset Global High Income Fund 
      Inc.’s primary investment objective is high current income and its 
      secondary investment objective is total return.
    

      If the proposed merger is approved by the stockholders of both Funds, 
      stockholders of Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc. would 
      receive common stock of Western Asset Global High Income Fund Inc., 
      based on each Fund’s respective net asset value per share.
    

      In recommending the merger to each Board of Directors, the Funds’ 
      investment adviser and sub-adviser, Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, 
      LLC and Western Asset Management Company, respectively, among other 
      things, noted the similar investment objectives and similar investment 
      policies and strategies of the Funds, and that Western Asset Global 
      Partners Income Fund Inc. is smaller than Western Asset Global High 
      Income Fund Inc. and has higher operating expenses as a percentage of 
      net assets. Management and each Board of Directors believe it is in the 
      best interests of stockholders to merge Western Asset Global Partners 
      Income Fund Inc. with and into Western Asset Global High Income Fund 
      Inc. in part because the combined Fund may benefit from economies of 
      scale, as one set of fixed expenses would be spread over a larger asset 
      base, as well as from enhanced market liquidity. Furthermore, 
      stockholders of Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc. would 
      likely benefit from greater asset diversification, lower overall 
      expenses and enhanced market liquidity as part of a larger Fund. 
      Stockholders of Western Asset Global High Income Fund Inc. may benefit 
      from greater asset diversification in addition to a more streamlined 
      high yield product offering, allowing for more focused marketing and 
      shareholder servicing efforts.
    

      In connection with the proposal to merge Western Asset Global Partners 
      Income Fund Inc. with and into Western Asset Global High Income Fund 
      Inc., Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc. and Western Asset 
      Global High Income Fund Inc. intend to file a combined proxy statement 
      and prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Investors 
      and stockholders are advised to read the proxy statement and prospectus 
      when it becomes available because it will contain important information. When 
      filed with the SEC, the proxy statement and prospectus and other 
      documents filed by the Funds will be available free of charge at the 
      SEC’s website, http://www.sec.gov. 
      Stockholders can also obtain copies of these documents, when available, 
      for free by calling the Funds at 1-888-777-0102.
    

      Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc., Western Asset Global 
      High Income Fund Inc., their directors and executive officers and 
      investment adviser, members of their management and employees may be 
      deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the Funds’ 
      stockholders in connection with the proposed merger. Information 
      concerning the interests of the participants in the solicitation will be 
      set forth in the proxy statement and prospectus and stockholder reports 
      of both Funds on Form N-CSR, to be filed with the SEC.
    

      As of September 30, 2015, Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc. 
      had total assets of approximately $207 million and Western Asset Global 
      High Income Fund Inc. had total assets of approximately $469 million. 
      Each Fund is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company 
      managed by Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC, a wholly owned 
      subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc., and sub-advised by Western Asset 
      Management Company, Western Asset Management Company Limited, and 
      Western Asset Management Company Pte. Ltd., affiliates of the investment 
      adviser. Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc. is also 
      sub-advised by Western Asset Management Company Ltd, an affiliate of the 
      sub-adviser.
    

      For more information, please call Investor Relations: 888-777-0102, or 
      consult either Fund’s web site at www.lmcef.com.

      available free of charge upon request.

      OFFER TO SELL SHARES OF THE FUNDS. THIS PRESS RELEASE MAY CONTAIN

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments are subject to risks, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments are subject to credit risk, inflation risk, and interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the Fund's share price. The Fund may invest in lower-rated high yield bonds which are subject to greater credit risk (risk of default) than higher-rated obligations. Investments in foreign securities involve risks, including the possibility of losses due to changes in currency exchange rates and negative developments in the political, economic, or regulatory structure of specific countries or regions. These risks are greater in emerging markets. Leverage may result in greater volatility of NAV and the market price of common shares and increases a shareholder's risk of loss. The Fund may make significant investments in derivative instruments. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund.

Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.

Tapering of the Federal Reserve Board’s quantitative easing program and a general rise in interest rates may lead to increased portfolio volatility.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price or NAV, and assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price or NAV, respectively. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.

 Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.

 Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund’s NAV.
*Distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution amount paid, excluding special distributions, divided by the closing market price or NAV. As of 06/30/2017, the fund estimates that the distributions will be paid from: 98.20% investment income;0.00% realized capital gains; and, 1.80% return of capital. The Distribution Rate is subject to change and is not a quotation of Fund performance. The Board of Directors may terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time. Any such termination or suspension could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment. For more information about a distribution's composition refer to the Fund's distribution press release or, if applicable, the Section 19 notice located in the Press Releases section below.



























A NOTE ABOUT FEES & EXPENSES: Based on the Fund’s net assets of the common shares, as of the most recent Annual Report.
Management fees: Under the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an annual fee, paid monthly, as a portion of the Fund's average daily Managed Assets. “Managed Assets” are defined as net assets plus the amount of any borrowing, including loans from certain financial institutions and/or the issuance of debt securities (collectively, “Borrowings”), and assets attributable to any preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) that may be outstanding. Please see the fund’s Annual Report for more information on expenses.


Expense ratio shown reflects a voluntary investment management fee waiver/or expense reimbursements by the fund's investment adviser which can be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. Absent the fee waiver/or expense reimbursements, expenses would be higher and total returns would be less. See the fund’s Annual Report for information on expenses and waivers.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS INFORMATION: Portfolio characteristics and holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. 

Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
 


Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). For this purpose, if two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the lowest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Distributions 






Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the performance section on this page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section below. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment.

These materials and any tax-related statements are not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used or relied upon, by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties. Tax-related statements, if any, may have been written in connection with the "promotion or marketing" of the transaction(s) or matter(s) addressed by these materials, to the extent allowed by applicable law. Any taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer's particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.

Press Releases





IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
