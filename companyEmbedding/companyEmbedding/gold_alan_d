Description
A practical guidebook to assist defence counsel in defending a client charged with drinking and driving.This practical guidebook, by renowned criminal defence lawyer Alan D. Gold, assists defence counsel in defending a client charged with a drinking and driving offence in a logical and coherent fashion from the beginning to the end of the process. It provides sound, practical advice on all steps along the way, including how to handle a phone call from the police station, factual issues to note, novel defences, the relevant law and sentencing. Topics addressed include the validity of the approved screening device test, proof of impairment, admissibility of blood and breathalyzer tests results, Charter defences, the concept of "care and control," and sentencing. The technical aspects of demands, breathalyzer reports, certificates, blood alcohol content reports and alcohol influence reports are also covered. New in this Edition This 2017 edition has been updated to reflect all the legislative developments since the last edition and incorporates all significant developments in the case law, including:  R. v. DeCastro (Ont. S.C.J.) – after the Crown failed to prove the first breath test had been taken within two hours, the trial judge erred by relying on assumptions of how fast police would have responded to the accident. R. v. Schouten (Ont. C.A.) – the odour of alcohol on the driver’s breath, accompanied by an admission of consumption hours earlier, made for reasonable grounds to believe alcohol remained in the body of the driver. R. v. Suter (S.C.C.) – although impairment was not established at trial, and even though the fatal accident was caused by non-impaired driver error, the trial judge’s application of the sentencing range for  impaired driving causing death was not an error. R. v. Vallentgoed (Alta. C.A.) – historical maintenance records of the impugned breathalyzer device were held not to be fruits of the investigation and not subject to obligatory disclosure, which meant the defence bears the onus of establishing their likely relevance.
About the Author

Alan D. Gold practices at Gold Professional Corporation, 20 Adelaide Street East, Suite 210, Toronto, M5C 2T6. His practice is restricted to criminal trial and appellate work, but otherwise covers the spectrum from sex offenses to white-collar crime, drinking and driving offences to homicides, including search and seizure issues and other Charter litigation. He has appeared as counsel before all levels of courts in Ontario, as well as in seven of the other provinces. A large number of the cases Mr. Gold has argued before the Ontario Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of Canada are reported. Mr. Gold is certified by the Law Society of Upper Canada as a Specialist in Criminal Litigation and was the first Chairman of the Criminal Litigation Specialty Committee for five years. In 1993 in Washington D.C. Mr. Gold was inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers. He was honoured in 1997 with the annual G. Arthur Martin Award for Contribution to Criminal Justice, awarded November 22nd, 1997, in Toronto. He is a past President of the Ontario Criminal Lawyers Association from 1997 to 2001. Mr. Gold was elected as a Bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada in May 2003 for a four year term.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

5.0/5.0










*Attorneys who only have peer reviews prior to April 15, 2008 are not displayed.









Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.
