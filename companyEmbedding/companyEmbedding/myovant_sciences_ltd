Focused on women's health








Innovation in prostate cancer treatment








Committed to endocrine disorders






DEDicated to WOMEN’S HEALTH AND PROSTATE CANCEROur goal is to be the leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on the innovative treatment of women’s health and endocrine diseases in areas of high unmet medical need, and improve the lives of millions of patients suffering from these diseases.




 Our lead program is relugolix, which has been evaluated in over 1,300 patients to date. Relugolix has successfully demonstrated significant clinical benefit and was generally well-tolerated across large, randomized Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with uterine fibroids, endometriosis and prostate cancer. In addition, we are developing MVT-602 for the treatment of female infertility as part of assisted reproduction. Over time, we intend to expand our development pipeline to include other potential treatments for endocrine-related disorders.

  RelugolixRelugolix is a once-daily, orally administered, small molecule investigational drug candidate that has the potential to be best-in-class for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis, and a potential best- and first-in-class treatment for advanced prostate cancer. 







How it WorksRelugolix is an oral, once-daily, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist. By inhibiting GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland, relugolix rapidly reduces the circulating gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to the suppression of estrogen in women and testosterone in men. Suppression of these hormones improves the symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women and decreases prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in men with advanced prostate cancer. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in 216 patients with uterine fibroids, women who received relugolix experienced a statistically significant reduction in menorrhagia, or heavy menstrual bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in 487 patients with endometriosis, women who received relugolix experienced statistically significant reductions in non-menstrual and menstrual pelvic pain. In two randomized Phase 2 studies in approximately 228 men with advanced prostate cancer, oral once-daily relugolix suppressed serum testosterone to castrate levels and decreased PSA. Across all phase 2 studies, relugolix was generally well-tolerated and its safety profile was consistent with its mechanism of action. Takeda is currently conducting two Phase 3 studies in women with uterine fibroids in Japan. Unlike GnRH agonists, relugolix does not cause transient increases in gonadotropin secretion (flare), which can result in an initial worsening of clinical symptoms. Moreover, upon treatment discontinuation, its effects diminish quickly and hormone levels rapidly return to baseline. We believe relugolix, when co-administered with low-dose estrogen and progesterone add-back therapy, will preserve bone mineral density in women and increase tolerability.

Our experienced team is dedicated to developing innovative therapies in areas of high unmet medical need to improve the lives of the millions of patients suffering from endocrine-related disorders such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis and prostate cancer.
Our lead program is relugolix, a once-daily, orally administered, small molecule investigational drug candidate that has the potential to be best-in-class for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis, and a potential best- and first-in-class treatment for advanced prostate cancer. To date, relugolix has been evaluated in over 1,300 patients. Results so far from large, randomized Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with uterine fibroids, endometriosis and prostate cancer have successfully demonstrated significant clinical benefit and that relugolix was generally well-tolerated.
In addition, we are developing MVT-602, an oligopeptide kisspeptin analog, for the treatment of female infertility. We believe it has the potential to be a safer alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin as part of assisted reproduction.
Over time, we intend to expand our development pipeline to include other potential treatments for endocrine-related disorders.

Myovant Sciences Initiates Phase 3 Clinical Program of Relugolix in Women with Endometriosis-Associated Pain
Jun 29 17
Myovant Sciences announced it has initiated a Phase 3 clinical program consisting of two international clinical trials, SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of relugolix in women with endometriosis-associated pain. Relugolix is an oral, once-daily, small molecule gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that decreases estrogen and progesterone. Relugolix will be evaluated with and without low-dose hormonal add-back therapy. SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3 clinical trials in women with endometriosis-associated pain. Each of the two clinical trials is expected to enroll approximately 600 women aged 18 to 50 years with a diagnosis of endometriosis confirmed by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Eligible women will be randomized to one of three groups: relugolix 40 mg orally once daily co-administered with low-dose hormonal add-back therapy (1 mg estradiol/0.5 mg norethindrone acetate) for 24 weeks, relugolix 40 mg orally once daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with hormonal add-back therapy for an additional 12 weeks, or placebo once daily for a period of 24 weeks. Eligible patients completing the initial 24-week blinded assessment will be offered an active treatment extension with relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with hormonal add-back therapy for an additional 28-week period, resulting in a total treatment period of up to 52 weeks, to evaluate the safety of longer-term treatment.


Myovant Sciences Announces Presentation of Data from Phase 2 Extension Study Conducted by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. Evaluating Relugolix in Japanese Women with Endometriosis-Associated Pain
May 24 17
Myovant Sciences announced the presentation of data from a Phase 2 extension study conducted by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. ("Takeda") evaluating relugolix in Japanese women with endometriosis-associated pain. Oral, once-daily treatment with relugolix (10, 20, or 40 mg) was generally well tolerated during the 24 weeks comprising the initial 12-week study and the 12-week extension study. Treatment-emergent adverse events for patients receiving relugolix, such as hot flush and menorrhagia, were consistent with the drug's mechanism of action. Efficacy outcomes for the full 24-week period were consistent with outcomes during the initial 12-week trial, with greater dose-dependent reductions in overall pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and non-menstrual pelvic pain seen in the relugolix treatment arms compared to placebo. The largest decrease was seen in the relugolix 40-mg group throughout the treatment period, and the reductions in the mean Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score from baseline for overall pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and non-menstrual pelvic pain in the relugolix 40-mg group were similar to those in an active reference group receiving monthly injections of leuprorelin. The findings were presented during a poster presentation on May 23 at the 2017 European Congress of Endocrinology in Lisbon, Portugal. Of the 484 patients randomized and administered study drug in the initial 12-week study, 397 (82%) were enrolled in the extension study, and 373 (94% of enrolled patients) completed the treatment period for the extension study. There were no clinically relevant differences in the demographic and baseline characteristics of the treatment groups. The incidence of mild and moderate adverse events in the relugolix 20- and 40-mg groups was higher than that observed in the placebo group, and comparable to that observed in an active reference group receiving monthly injections of leuprorelin. The most commonly observed adverse events (occurring in at least 10% of patients in the relugolix groups and greater in the relugolix than placebo groups) were primarily mild or moderate in severity and included irregular or heavy menstrual bleeding (metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, irregular menstruation), sweating (hyperhidrosis), and hot flush. Bone mineral density decreased in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in the relugolix groups with the great losses (mean percent change from baseline) after 24 weeks observed in the relugolix 40-mg group (-4.9%), as compared with the placebo group (-0.2%) and the leuprorelin group (-4.4%). The menstruation recovery period was 21 to 37 days after the last dose in the relugolix groups; the recovery period in the leuprorelin group was 73 days. Reductions in mean VAS score from baseline for overall pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and non-menstrual pelvic pain in the relugolix groups were dose-dependent, with the largest decreases in the relugolix 40-mg group throughout the treatment period. Pain intensity was assessed using a 100 millimeter (mm) VAS in which 0 mm indicated "No pain" and 100 mm indicated "Pain as bad as you can imagine." Scores were reported daily in patient diaries. The mean reduction in overall pelvic pain for the relugolix 40-mg group at the end of the extension study was -11.9 mm from baseline (15.3 mm), compared to a mean reduction of -3.2 mm in the placebo arm from baseline (15.6 mm). The reduction achieved by relugolix, 40 mg orally once daily, was comparable to that observed in the active control arm of patients receiving monthly injections of leuprorelin. For pain during menses, or dysmenorrhea, the relugolix 40-mg group achieved a mean reduction of -29.5 mm at the end of extension study from baseline (30.4 mm) compared to a mean reduction of -5.8 mm in the placebo group from baseline (28.4 mm). No clear trend was observed in mean VAS scores from baseline across the dosing groups for dyspareunia with a trend for lower scores over time for the relugolix 40 mg and leuprorelin groups. The proportion of patients reporting no pain in the VAS score for overall pelvic pain at the end of the treatment period were 0% for placebo, 7% for relugolix 10 mg, 20% for relugolix 20 mg, 50% for relugolix 40 mg, and 57% for leuprorelin. The Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled long-term extension study conducted by Takeda was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix administered orally at a dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg once daily for a full 24 weeks in premenopausal Japanese women, 20 years of age or older, with a diagnosis of both endometriosis and moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhea or pelvic pain who participated in a prior double-blind, 12-week study. The study also included an active reference group that received monthly injections of leuprorelin. The prior Phase 2 study consisted of a 4- to 12-week pretreatment period with a placebo run-in period that was initiated during the first menstrual cycle; after completion of the pretreatment period patients were randomly assigned to either a relugolix treatment group, an injectable leuprorelin group, or placebo for a 12-week treatment period. Upon completion of that treatment period, eligible participants were offered the opportunity to enter the 12-week extension study. Patients in the extension study were assigned to the same treatment groups as the preceding Phase 2 study. The study's primary outcome was assessment of safety, including bone mineral density, adverse events, vital signs, weight, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests. The secondary endpoint was an assessment of efficacy through 24 weeks including VAS scores for overall pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia at the end of treatment. Additional endpoints included endometriosis-associated pain symptoms assessed by physician Biberoglu & Behrman (B & B) scores and modified patient B & B scores, use of analgesics during the treatment period, decrease in menstrual blood loss and achievement of amenorrheic state, and quality of life and symptom severity as assessed by long-form 30-item EHP-30 scores.

Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer’s DiseaseAlzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. A chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer’s usually develops slowly and can get worse over time. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s disease affects approximately 5.4 million people in the United States today and the number of patients afflicted with the disease is growing every year. By 2050, it is projected that approximately 14 million people will be living with Alzheimer’s disease in the US. In 2017, total healthcare costs for Alzheimer’s and other dementias are estimated to reach $259 billion in the US alone. Meanwhile, no new treatment options for patients have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease since 2003.An estimated 80% of Alzheimer’s disease patients age 65 and older are classified as mild-to-moderate, which is the patient population Axovant is focused on treating with intepirdine (RVT-101). Axovant is currently developing intepirdine in a Phase 3 international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intepirdine in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease patients called the MINDSET study.Learn More About Mindset

Dementia With Lewy Bodies (DLB)
Lewy body dementia, or LBD, is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the second most common form of dementia. LBD is characterized by a build-up of abnormal proteins known as Lewy bodies in areas of the brain that control cognition, movement, alertness, and behavior.

Lewy body dementia includes two similar conditions – dementia with Lewy bodies, or DLB, and Parkinson’s disease dementia, or PDD. The primary difference between both conditions generally depends on the timing of the onset of cognitive decline relative to the onset of movement-related symptoms.

In dementia with Lewy bodies, cognitive decline generally occurs within one year of the onset of movement disorder symptoms. In Parkinson’s disease dementia, movement disorder symptoms precede cognitive decline by more than a year.

Along with suffering from impaired cognition and behavioral disturbances, LBD patients often suffer from: visual hallucinations; fluctuations in cognition, attention and alertness; sensitivity to neuroleptic (antipsychotic) medications; REM behavior disorder, or RBD, in which people physically act out their dreams; and Parkinsonism (movement disorder, with symptoms including muscle rigidity and tremors).

The Lewy Body Dementia Association estimates that there are 1.4 million patients with Lewy body dementia in the United States.

Our subsidiary, Axovant, is currently developing two drug candidates to treat certain aspects of Lewy body dementia – intepirdine (RVT-101) and nelotanserin. Currently, there are no drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of DLB. Intepirdine has the potential to be the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of DLB.

Gait and Balance Impairments in Dementia
Axovant is currently conducting a phase 2 study to evaluate the effects of intepirdine on gait and balance in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia. In this study, Axovant intends to further investigate the observation of a reduced rate of falls seen in patients treated with intepirdine in a prior 684-patient study of intepirdine on a background of stable donepezil therapy.

Visual Hallucinations in Lewy Body Dementia
Axovant is currently conducting a phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study evaluating nelotanserin in patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD) suffering from visual hallucinations.

The safety, efficacy, and tolerability of nelotanserin at doses of 40 mg and 80 mg will be evaluated over a 4-week treatment period in approximately 20 subjects with LBD. This is a crossover study so every subject will receive placebo for 4 weeks and nelotanserin for 4 weeks, but neither patients or their doctor will know which treatment they are taking. The primary outcome measure will be safety and tolerability. The frequency and severity of visual hallucinations over a 4-week treatment period will be a secondary outcome measure. Patients who complete the study will be eligible to receive nelotanserin in an extension study.

Rem Behavior Disorder (RBD) In DLB
Axovant is currently conducting a phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating nelotanserin in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) experiencing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD).

The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 80 mg of nelotanserin will be evaluated over a 4-week period in approximately 60 patients with DLB. The primary efficacy evaluation will be a change in the frequency of REM sleep behaviors by the end of 4 weeks. Patients who complete the study will be eligible to receive nelotanserin in an extension study.

Alzheimer’s DiseaseAxovant plans to develop and, if successful, commercialize products that combine cholinesterase inhibitors with peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonists including glycopyrrolate, which could mitigate the peripheral side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors.Axovant recently completed a proof of concept study for RVT-103 designed to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and tolerability of 5 mg donepezil plus placebo versus 10 mg of donepezil when given concomitantly with one of three different regimens including either glycopyrrolate or trospium over a 10-day period. The study measured subject nausea in 48 healthy, elderly subjects using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at baseline and once every two hours for eight hours after dosing on Days 1, 3, 7, and 10.On the final day of dosing, when nausea for subjects in the 5 mg donepezil plus placebo arm achieved a peak mean change from baseline on the VAS, subjects in the arms receiving 10 mg donepezil plus either glycopyrrolate or trospium demonstrated a 67 percent to 95 percent reduction in nausea relative to the 5 mg donepezil plus placebo arm.Based on these results, the Company expects to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss additional studies that could support registration of RVT-103 and expects to initiate a proof of concept study for RVT-104 in the second half of 2017.

Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is a malignant transformation of tissue within the male prostate gland. Often characterized by slow growth, prostate cancer is the second most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the United States. Approximately 2.9 million men in the United States are currently living with prostate cancer, and 180,000 men are newly diagnosed each year. Symptoms of prostate cancer include increased urinary frequency, dysuria, hematuria, and nocturnal urination. Current treatments include combinations of surgery, radiation or proton beam therapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Myovant is currently developing relugolix, an oral, once-daily, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist. By inhibiting GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland, relugolix rapidly reduces the circulating gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to the suppression of estrogen in women and testosterone in men. Suppression of these hormones improves the symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women and decreases prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in men with advanced prostate cancer.

Uterine FibroidsUterine fibroids are non-cancerous tumors that develop from the muscle and connective tissue of the uterus. Approximately 25% of women of reproductive age have uterine fibroids, and 1 in 4 experience symptoms requiring treatment. Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors, they may cause debilitating symptoms including heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, anemia, and pelvic pain. Current treatments include hormonal contraceptives, GnRH agonists, and surgical interventions including myomectomy and hysterectomy.Myovant is currently developing relugolix, an oral, once-daily, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist.

EndometriosisEndometriosis is a gynecological medical condition in which cells that normally line the uterus grow outside of the uterine cavity. An estimated 7.5 million women in the United States have endometriosis, and 3 in 4 experience symptoms requiring treatment. During the menstrual cycle, endometriosis lesions grow, differentiate, and shed into the abdomen, causing symptoms including non-menstrual pelvic pain and pain during menstruation (dysmenorrhea). Current treatments include hormonal contraceptives, danazol, GnRH agonists, and various surgical interventions for severe cases.Myovant is currently developing relugolix, an oral, once-daily, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist.

Female Infertility
Approximately 25% of infertile women have problems related to ovulation, including the inability to produce fully matured eggs or release an egg from the ovary (i.e., “ovulate”). In the course of treating infertility related to anovulation, fertility specialists use a group of medications to temporarily correct ovulatory problems and increase a woman’s chance for pregnancy. These and related procedures are broadly termed Assisted Reproductive Technology, or ART. Approximately 1.5 million cycles of ART were performed globally in 2012.

Myovant is currently developing MVT-602, an analog of kisspeptin, a naturally-occurring peptide in humans that plays a key role in egg maturation and ovulation by increasing the release of LH and FSH through the stimulation of GnRH secretion.

Recent evidence from trials performed in women undergoing assisted reproduction revealed that the native kisspeptin peptide has the potential to act as an alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or GnRH agonists in triggering egg maturation, an essential step in all assisted reproduction cycles. Myovant believes that MVT-602 may induce the release of LH and FSH in a manner that more closely mimics natural physiology, potentially avoiding side effects associated with hCG or GnRH agonist administration, including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

Farber Disease
Farber disease is an ultra-rare lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in both alleles of the ASAH1 gene, resulting in the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase. This leads to the accumulation of the pro-inflammatory sphingolipid ceramide, and a macrophage driven inflammatory process causing the development of typical clinical symptoms. Like many other lysosomal storage diseases, Farber disease has a broad phenotypic spectrum, and is likely underdiagnosed.

Farber patients typically present with the cardinal symptoms of joint contractures or arthritis, subcutaneous nodules, and weak or hoarse voice.

It may take years for all three cardinal symptoms to appear together, and they may vary greatly in severity. Patients may also present with systemic inflammation (fever), severe pain, peripheral osteolysis, failure to thrive, and developmental delay.

Recombinant human acid ceramidase (rhAC) is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) under development for the treatment of Farber disease. Initially developed by Dr. Edward Schuchman at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, rhAC showed positive results in various preclinical studies. rhAC was granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Enzyvant is currently conducting the pre-clinical studies for rhAC to enable a clinical trial in patients with Farber disease.

Complete DiGeorge Syndrome
DiGeorge Syndrome is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in multiple genes on chromosome 22, leading to defective development of the pharyngeal pouch system and variety of consequences including congenital heart disease, dysfunctional calcium metabolism, and thymic hypoplasia among others. Children born with complete DiGeorge Syndrome (cDGS) represent approximately 1% of the overall DiGeorge population and lack any thymic tissue (athymia). This causes severe immunodeficiency due to an inability to produce normally functioning T-cells, which defend against infection and regulate essential processes in the immune system. cDGS is uniformly fatal if untreated, with death typically occurring in the first two years of life due to susceptibility to infection.

RVT-802 is a biologic therapy being developed for the treatment of primary immune deficiency resulting from cDGS. RVT-802 utilizes proprietary processes developed by Dr. Louise Markert (Professor of Pediatrics, Duke University) to harvest, culture, and engraft allogeneic thymic tissue. Preliminary clinical results suggest a survival rate of over 70% for treated patients. The findings of Dr. Markert and her research team have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine as well as numerous other peer-reviewed scientific journals and clinical publications.

RVT-802 has been granted Orphan Drug designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Enzyvant anticipates a potential BLA filing in 2018 for the treatment of cDGS. Enzyvant continues to collaborate with Dr. Markert and is exploring other indications for which RVT-802 may play a therapeutic role.

Moderate-to-Severe Dermatologic Indications
Dermavant has an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the development and commercialization of cerdulatinib in topical applications beyond oncology. Dermavant intends to pursue the clinical development of cerdulatinib, a dual spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, as a topical therapy for a variety of dermatologic conditions. Dermavant believes that the profile of cerdulatinib is ideal for development in skin diseases where a growing body of evidence suggests that both JAK and Syk are important drivers of disease manifestation.

Inflammatory Skin Diseases
Dermavant plans to pursue the clinical development of RVT-201, a novel caspase-1 inhibitor, as a topical therapy for multiple dermatologic conditions.

Overactive BladderUrovant’s lead therapeutic candidate is vibegron, an investigational oral β3-adrenergic agonist being developed for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. β3-adrenergic receptors play an important role in the bladder fill-void cycle. By stimulating that pathway, vibegron has the potential to relax the bladder detrusor muscle. Relaxing the bladder allows it to store urine more efficiently, thereby decreasing the symptoms of OAB.Urovant has licensed international rights, excluding Japan and certain Asian territories, for the development and commercialization of vibegron (formerly MK-4618) from Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. Over 2,700 patients with symptoms of overactive bladder have been enrolled in clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of vibegron, including a completed global randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled Phase 2b study of over 1,300 subjects that met its primary and key secondary endpoints, and a completed randomized, placebo and active comparator-controlled Phase 3 study of over 1,000 patients conducted outside of the United States that met its primary and key secondary endpoints. Urovant anticipates initiating an international Phase 3 registration program for vibegron in 2017.
