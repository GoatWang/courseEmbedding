					About				







Trian is a highly engaged shareowner, bringing a private equity mindset to the public markets





From Left to Right: Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May
Founded in 2005, Trian Fund Management, L.P. (“Trian”) is a multi-billion dollar investment management firm with over 50 employees. Trian is a highly engaged shareowner that combines concentrated public equity ownership with operational expertise. Leveraging the 40+ years’ operating experience of our Principals, Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, Trian seeks to invest in high quality but undervalued and underperforming public companies and to work collaboratively with management teams and boards of those companies to execute operational and strategic initiatives designed to drive long-term sustainable earnings growth for the benefit of all shareholders.




Feedback From Our Portfolio Companies





“Trian has a strong track record of working with companies to build long-term shareholder value, and has been an engaged shareholder. We appreciate their perspectives and look forward to a constructive ongoing dialogue with Trian as we execute our strategy to reshape the Company.” 1
– Jeffrey R. Immelt (Chairman and CEO of General Electric) 












“We believe that Nelson will be a valuable addition to our Board. We respect his more than 40 years of business and investment experience as well as his expertise helping consumer products companies leverage their brands and improve operating and financial performance.  We welcome his input as we deliver superior shareholder returns.” 2
– Irene Rosenfeld (Chairman and CEO of Mondelēz)












“Ed brings to our Board the perspective of a large and engaged shareholder in BNY Mellon and has a track record of working collaboratively with other boards and management teams. We welcome him and we look forward to benefiting from Trian’s insights and contributions as we continue to build value for our clients and shareholders.” 3
– Gerald Hassell (Chairman and CEO of BNY Mellon)












“We are firmly committed to enhancing value for all Sysco shareholders and always welcome constructive input toward driving long-term shareholder value.  Nelson and Josh will bring our Board an informed perspective based on their significant experience in the food products industry. We have engaged in constructive dialogue with Nelson and Josh and look forward to benefiting from their insights and contributions.” 4
– Jackie Ward (non-executive chairman of Sysco’s Board of Directors)












“We have maintained an active and constructive dialogue with Trian regarding our common goal of increasing shareholder value, as we do with all of our shareholders.  We believe the addition of Ed to our board would bring a shareholder’s perspective and we look forward to benefiting from his insights and Trian’s strong analytical work.  Pentair remains focused on driving productivity and identifying strategic opportunities to position our portfolio for long-term growth.” 5
