Shareholders








Board of Trustees A mutual fund is governed by a Board of Trustees which has oversight responsibility for the management of the fund's business affairs. Trustees establish procedures and oversee and review the performance of the investment manager, the distributor and others that perform services for the fund. Generally, at least 40% of the Board of Trustees must be independent of the fund's investment manager and distributor. However, the Fund relies on certain exemptive rules created by the SEC that require the Board of Trustees overseeing the Fund to be comprised of a majority of such independent Trustees. These independent fund trustees, in particular, are advocates for shareholder interests.

Investment manager An investment manager is a company responsible for selecting portfolio investments consistent with the objective and policies stated in the mutual fund's Prospectus. The investment manager places portfolio orders with broker/dealers and is responsible for obtaining the best overall execution of those orders. A written contract between a mutual fund and its investment manager specifies the services the manager performs. Most management contracts provide for the manager to receive an annual fee based on a percentage of the fund's average daily net assets. The manager is subject to numerous legal restrictions, especially regarding transactions between itself and the funds it advises.
Sub-advisor A sub-advisor is a company generally responsible for the management of the fund's assets or some portion thereof. The sub-advisor is selected and supervised by the investment manager.
Portfolio managers Portfolio managers are employed by the investment manager and/or sub-advisor to make investment decisions for individual portfolios on a day-to-day basis.
Custodian Mutual funds are legally required to protect their portfolio securities and most funds place them with a qualified bank custodian who segregates fund securities from other bank assets.

Distributor Most mutual funds continuously offer new shares to the public through distributors who are regulated as broker-dealers and are subject to NASD Regulation, Inc. (NASDRSM) rules governing mutual fund sales practices.
Financial intermediary wholesaler Pursuant to a contractual arrangement with Delaware Distributors, L.P., Lincoln Financial Distributors, Inc. (LFD) is primarily responsible for promoting the sale of Fund shares through broker/dealers, financial advisors and other financial intermediaries.
Service agent Mutual fund companies employ service agents (sometimes called transfer agents) to maintain records of shareholder accounts, calculate and disburse dividends and capital gains and prepare and mail shareholder statements and tax information, among other functions. Many service agents also provide customer service to shareholders.
Financial advisors Financial advisors provide advice to their clients, analyzing their financial objectives and recommending appropriate funds or other investments. Financial advisors are compensated for their services, generally through sales commissions, and through 12b-1 and/or service fees deducted from the fund's assets.
Shareholders Like shareholders of other companies, mutual fund shareholders have specific voting rights, including the right to elect trustees. Material changes in the terms of a fund's management contract must be approved by a shareholder vote, and funds seeking to change fundamental investment policies must also seek shareholder approval.

Objective

Delaware International Small Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.


Strategy

The Fund invests primarily in common stocks of non-US companies, which may include companies located or operating in developed or emerging markets.  Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 40% of its net assets in non-US securities and up to 30% of its net assets in emerging markets. The manager currently invests primarily in smaller capitalization companies domiciled outside of the United States.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.


Total returns may reflect waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the manager and/or distributor for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

Benchmark lifetime returns are as of the month end after the Fund's inception date. 
Performance at NAV assumes that no front-end sales charge applied. Performance at max offer price assumes that a front-end sales charge applied.

Class A shares have a maximum up-front sales charge of 5.75% and are subject to an annual distribution fee.

Prior to Dec. 29, 2010, the Fund had not engaged in a broad distribution of its shares and had been subject to limited redemption requests. The returns reflect expense limitations that were in effect during certain periods and that may have been lower than the Fund's current expenses. The returns would have been lower without the expense limitations.

Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs, or expenses. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index.

Expense ratioGross1.51%Net1.38%
Net expense ratio reflects a contractual waiver of certain fees and/or expense reimbursements from June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2018. Please see the fee table in the Fund’s prospectus for more information.

Delaware International Small Cap Fund (formerly, Delaware Focus Global Growth Fund)  Quarterly commentary June 30, 2017
Within the Fund
While stock exposure largely drove the Fund’s performance during the second quarter of 2017, the consumer discretionary and healthcare sectors also contributed. From a country perspective, Australia and the United Kingdom contributed to performance. The Fund’s strongest individual contributors included Evotec, Aristocrat Leisure, and Fincantieri.
Shares of German drug research-and-development company, Evotec, continued to outperform during the second quarter after reporting better-than-expected results for its fiscal year ended 2016 and better margins in the first quarter of 2017. Moreover, the company achieved its first milestone payment for diabetes research from its research alliance with global pharmaceutical company Sanofi.
Australian company Aristocrat Leisure is a global manufacturer and seller of gaming machines. The company also supplies gaming systems, software, and other gaming-related products. Aristocrat Leisure outperformed during the quarter after reporting better-than-expected results at the end of May. Its North America Class III gaming business continued to grow and take market share. Its International Class III gaming business benefited from the recent launch of a new gaming product, Lightning Link. Additionally, digital daily average users (DAUs) continued to grow.
Fincantieri, an Italian shipbuilder focusing on cruise ships and navy vessels, outperformed after announcing new ship contracts with Viking Ocean Cruises and the French Navy. In addition, the company announced the anticipated acquisition of STX France as it continues to consolidate the market.
In contrast, from a sector perspective information technology detracted from the Fund’s performance during the quarter. From a country standpoint, South Korea and India weighed on performance. The Fund’s largest individual detractors included Tongda Group, Outokumpu, and Sumco.
Tongda Group is a Chinese consumer electronic component manufacturer. It supplies plastic and metal casings for notebook PCs, electrical appliances, and smartphones. The company’s share price declined during the quarter amid allegations of lost market share at one of its key customers, Chinese smartphone manufacturer Oppo. We decided to exit the Fund’s position in Tongda Group during the quarter.
Shares of Finnish stainless steel manufacturer and ferrochrome producer Outokumpu underperformed during the quarter after technical issues in one of its ferrochrome furnaces curtailed production. Additionally, the company said it expected ferrochrome pricing to be weaker throughout 2017.
Sumco, a Japanese manufacturer of silicon wafers, underperformed during the quarter because of concerns about an increased supply of silicon wafers. The company’s share price struggled, despite the relatively small announced capacity increase compared to the overall market and strength in demand. The company had benefited from tightness in the wafer market and a supportive pricing environment. 
Positioning and outlook
The Fund’s country and sector relative weights continue to be driven primarily by bottom-up stock selection and where we’re finding attractive opportunities. As a result, at the end of the quarter, the Fund’s largest sector overweights relative to its benchmark, the MSCI ACWI ex USA Small Cap Index, were consumer discretionary and materials. The largest country overweights were Brazil and France. The largest underweights relative to the benchmark from a country perspective were South Korea and Australia. Real estate and financials were the largest sector underweights. 
We continue to be confident about the opportunities present in international small-cap equities. While political and geopolitical uncertainty persists throughout the world, we believe the underlying economies in many regions remain supportive. Small-caps outside the United States have exhibited strong performance over the past few quarters, and we believe that should continue.
In our view, international small-caps are poised to catch up to the relative outperformance of US small-caps over the past decade. As the US economic recovery has been a step ahead of non-US markets, we see key catalysts that should lead to an inflection point, such as reduced political risk, strong earnings, or an overall encouraging macro environment. While we are mindful of the risks present, we remain optimistic. 
Regardless of the economic environment, we will continue to adhere to our disciplined approach that focuses on identifying positive fundamental change in companies that we view as having strong and sustainable business models.

Apollo Global Management LLC amassed $24.6-billion for the largest fund ever raised by a leveraged-buyout firm, crowning a string of record-setting war chests as investors hunt for better returns.Apollo’s ninth private equity fund hit its $23.5-billion hard cap and added additional money from the firm, employees and affiliated people, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. It intends to have $24.7-billion in total, the filing shows.

The magnitude of the pool is a testament to the rise of private equity as an asset class. Top performers have leapfrogged the size of their prior funds as yield-starved institutions and wealthy clients, pleased with earlier profitable commitments, seek continued returns. Apollo Investment Fund IX tops the previous buyout pool record of $21.7-billion, which was raised by Blackstone Group LP from 2005 to 2007. Apollo, which began fundraising around December, blew past that amount in about seven months.Last year, Advent International finished collecting $13-billion after only six months in the market, topping its $10.8-billion predecessor fund. KKR & Co. closed on $13.9-billion for its latest North American buyout fund in March, the largest for a pool focused on the region. The next month, Silver Lake announced it closed on a $15-billion fund, breaking the record for technology-focused pools.Private equity fundraising in the second quarter reached $121-billion, exceeding $100-billion for the third consecutive quarter, according to research firm Preqin Ltd. Much of that capital is going to a smaller group of funds as investors seek one-stop shopping with fewer money managers.“Fundraising momentum for the private equity market has remained very strong,” Christopher Elvin, Preqin’s head of private equity products, said in a second-quarter fundraising update. “However, high valuations continue to make it difficult for funds to put capital to work as quickly as they can secure it.”Apollo returned to the fundraising market almost three years after getting $18.4-billion for its eighth fund. While high valuations last year sidelined many of its peers, New York-based Apollo surpassed its own spending records. It snatched up companies including ADT Corp., Fresh Market Inc., Diamond Resorts International Inc., Outerwall Inc. and Rackspace Hosting Inc.“In many cases, we’re building platforms a la ADT, or we’re turning around companies a la The Fresh Market, or we’re repositioning and divesting certain things a la Rackspace,” Apollo co-founder Josh Harris said on a call with analysts in April.A diverse set of strategies may be increasingly important as cash-rich firms compete for deals.“Today it’s got to go past a plain-vanilla leveraged buyout strategy,” said Andrea Auerbach, head of global private investment research at Cambridge Associates. “You have to have more in your bag of tricks to generate compelling returns.”Apollo’s eighth fund generated a 16 per cent annualized return after fees as of March 31, according to Apollo’s first-quarter earnings statement. Its seventh fund returned 26 per cent a year.Led by founders Leon Black, Harris and Marc Rowan, Apollo oversaw $197.5-billion in private equity, credit and real estate as of March 31.
