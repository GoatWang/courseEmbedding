					Overview			

 

 





Intrusion has a long track record of delivering proven, robust, network monitoring and analysis solutions to high profile customers including Fortune 500 financial services companies as well as the US government. In 2000, Intrusion launched its first intrusion detection system (IDS) to the enterprise market, which was followed by the launch of its intrusion prevention system (IPS) in 2002.Leveraging its expertise with high performance networking and security systems, Intrusion began development in 2003 on its Compliance Commander Sentry product – a content monitoring and filtering (CMF) solution for protecting confidential customer data from leaking onto public networks.   Compliance Commander was launched in 2004 and has had successful adoption throughout small, medium and large financial services organizations, as well as in the healthcare sector. These organizations rely on Compliance Commander to protect their businesses against leakage of confidential customer information as dictated by recent legislation including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act (GLBA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).Intrusion launched TraceCop in 2005. TraceCop is a suite of Internet monitoring and tracking products that provides unprecedented capabilities for the identification of malicious and illegal activities based on both historical and current Internet usage data. TraceCop helps analysts and investigators dramatically reduce the time and complexity for discovering identities, ownership and contact information for computer devices on the Internet. This tool greatly reduces the time required to track down Internet perpetrators, thereby making it easier for law enforcement officials to prosecute Internet related offences.Savant is Intrusion’s newest solution. Savant is a transparent network data capture and analysis solution that brings science into corporate decision making.  This new insight will provide the ability to address many of today’s major challenges faced by corporations such as company infrastructure issues, performance issues, and identifying the true 'Wizards' or recognized experts by their peers.

					Overview			

 

 





Intrusion has a long track record of delivering proven, robust, network monitoring and analysis solutions to high profile customers including Fortune 500 financial services companies as well as the US government. In 2000, Intrusion launched its first intrusion detection system (IDS) to the enterprise market, which was followed by the launch of its intrusion prevention system (IPS) in 2002.Leveraging its expertise with high performance networking and security systems, Intrusion began development in 2003 on its Compliance Commander Sentry product – a content monitoring and filtering (CMF) solution for protecting confidential customer data from leaking onto public networks.   Compliance Commander was launched in 2004 and has had successful adoption throughout small, medium and large financial services organizations, as well as in the healthcare sector. These organizations rely on Compliance Commander to protect their businesses against leakage of confidential customer information as dictated by recent legislation including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act (GLBA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).Intrusion launched TraceCop in 2005. TraceCop is a suite of Internet monitoring and tracking products that provides unprecedented capabilities for the identification of malicious and illegal activities based on both historical and current Internet usage data. TraceCop helps analysts and investigators dramatically reduce the time and complexity for discovering identities, ownership and contact information for computer devices on the Internet. This tool greatly reduces the time required to track down Internet perpetrators, thereby making it easier for law enforcement officials to prosecute Internet related offences.Savant is Intrusion’s newest solution. Savant is a transparent network data capture and analysis solution that brings science into corporate decision making.  This new insight will provide the ability to address many of today’s major challenges faced by corporations such as company infrastructure issues, performance issues, and identifying the true 'Wizards' or recognized experts by their peers.
