Oral GI-Restricted Peptide Advantages Over Antibody Drugs
Oral Administration

Localized delivery with higher drug concentrations at site of active disease
Reduced risk of infections due to injections or infusions
Greater convenience leads to increased compliance in patients

Improved Safety and Tolerability

Oral and GI-restricted delivery minimizes systemic exposure in the blood
Peptides can be cleared more quickly from systemic circulation
Likelihood of lower immunogenicity and reduces the risk of loss of response

Cost-Effectiveness

Lower cost of production, storage, and shipment
Less complex manufacturing processes required



 

 

Pipeline


We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary technology platform focused on discovering and developing peptide-based new chemical entities (NCEs) to address significant unmet medical needs. Our primary focus is on developing first-in-class oral peptide drugs that specifically target biological pathways also targeted by currently marketed injectable antibody drugs. Compared to injectable antibody drugs, our oral peptides offer targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal (GI) tissue compartment, potential for improved safety due to minimal exposure in the blood, improved convenience and compliance due to oral delivery, and the opportunity for earlier introduction of targeted therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our initial lead product candidates, PTG-100 and PTG-200, are based on this approach, and we believe they have the potential to transform the existing treatment paradigm for IBD, a GI disease consisting primarily of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).
IBD is a chronic inflammatory disease with significant unmet medical need, which has created a large and growing market with an estimated 1.6 million patients in the United States in 2013. As of 2008, annual direct treatment costs for patients with IBD in the United States were estimated to exceed $6.3 billion, with indirect costs estimated to be an additional $5.5 billion. In 2012, Global Data estimated that the UC and CD markets reached approximately $4.2 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, across ten major markets, and Global Data estimates that these markets are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% to 5% through 2022. The current tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) antibody drugs approved for moderate-to-severe IBD, Humira® and Remicade®, are both injectable. According to Global Data, the 2013 sales for Humira® and Remicade® for IBD were $3.4 billion in the United States. Approximately one third of IBD patients are nonresponders to TNF-α antibody drugs and approximately another 30% to 40% become refractory within the first year of treatment. Additionally, TNF-α antibody drugs may predispose patients to an increased risk of serious infection and the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), which over time can cause loss of drug response. Thus, while available treatments exist for moderate-to-severe IBD, there continues to be a significant medical need for efficacious, safer, and convenient treatments.

PTG-100: A GI-Restricted α4β7 Integrin-Specific Antagonist for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe UC
PTG-100 is a potential first-in-class oral, alpha-4-beta-7 (α4β7) integrin-specific antagonist peptide product candidate which has now completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers (NHVs), and is being developed initially for potential treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC). α4β7 integrin is considered to be one of the most GI-specific biological targets for IBD due to its binding to MAdCAM-1, an extracellular protein that resides mostly in the GI vasculature.
PTG-200: A Potential First-in-Class Oral IL-23R Antagonist for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe IBD
PTG-200 is a potential first-in-class oral Interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) antagonist being developed initially for moderate-to-severe CD. PTG-200 is currently in Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2017.
We believe PTG-100 and PTG-200 have the potential to transform the existing IBD treatment paradigm because they offer significant advantages over injectable antibody drugs. These complementary assets target different biological pathways, and potentially offer improved convenience, patient compliance, and safety and tolerability compared to currently approved injectable antibody drugs. We believe these potential advantages could allow our products to replace and expand the IBD market beyond the moderate-to-severe IBD patient population currently treated by injectable antibody drugs.
PTG-300: An Injectable Hepcidin Mimetic Being Developed to Treat Iron Overload Disorders
Our novel peptides have potential applicability in a wide range of therapeutic areas in addition to GI diseases. Our first product candidate beyond IBD is PTG-300, an injectable hepcidin mimetic, which is currently in pre-clinical development. PTG-300 has potential utility for the treatment of iron overload disorders, such as transfusion-dependent β-Thalassemia, hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and sickle cell disease (SCD), each of which may qualify for orphan designation.

Style Scores:



D Value | C Growth | D Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
