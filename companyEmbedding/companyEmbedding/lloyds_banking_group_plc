Serving Britain for over 250 years
In June 1765, Taylors & Lloyds opened as a private bank in Birmingham. The bank was established by Sampson Lloyd, a Quaker and iron founder, and John Taylor, a Unitarian and cabinet maker along with their two sons. For nearly 100 years, the business prospered from a single Birmingham office. The association with the Taylor family ended on 1853.
Today, the Lloyds Bank black horse is one of the most iconic and enduring logos in the UK. But icons are not created overnight. In fact, the story of the black horse parallels the story of British banking itself. The logo dates back to at least 1677 when it was used by London’s Lombard Street goldsmiths, the forerunners of today’s modern banks. Then it was adopted by Barnetts, Hoares & Co on the same site, before being inherited by Lloyds Bank in 1884.
The black horse has now been in continuous use by Lloyds Bank for 130 years and today is one of the most recognised British icons a bold symbol of the bank’s heritage, strength and stability.
Decades of mergers saw Lloyds Bank grow from its Birmingham base to a national and international bank. Along the way Lloyds Bank took over the firm that invented the Travellers cheque, launched the first ATM machine in the UK (which it called Cashpoint®) and played a leading role in the launch of one of the first UK credit cards.
In 1995 Lloyds Bank and TSB merged to create Lloyds TSB, forming one of the largest forces in British domestic banking.  In January 2009, in the midst of a global financial crisis, Lloyds TSB took over HBOS plc. The new company, Lloyds Banking Group, instantly became the largest retail bank in the UK.
On 9th September 2013 Lloyds TSB once again became two separate banks. More than 630 branches were brought together across Britain to form the new TSB. And the iconic black horse logo was given a makeover for the return of Lloyds Bank on the high street.
Today, Lloyds Bank proudly continues in its commitment to serve households, people and communities across the UK; dedicated to helping Britain prosper.

Helping Britain Prosper Plan


















About the plan

 
We launched the Plan in 2014, drawing on advice about how to shape it from our senior leaders and many external stakeholders, including our Independent Stakeholder Panel and Foundations. In 2016, we adjusted the Plan to make it more ambitious and more measurable
As part of the fabric of Britain, we can see first hand the challenges Britain faces through our operations and our 75,000 colleagues. The Plan is core to our strategy. We know from long experience that when Britain prospers we do too, so the Plan is an investment in our collective long-term success. It supports our strategy to become the best bank for customers and it’s fundamental to rebuilding trust in our brands and sector.

Our targets fall naturally into three categories, reflecting our desire to help people, businesses and communities across Britain.

Dairy Farmers churn their way to success

The farming industry has faced a number of difficult years, with arguably dairy farmers some of the worst hit. Despite being the tenth-largest milk producer in the world, many UK dairy farmers are looking to switch to other types of farming or to close completely.Undeniably these tough times are due to falling milk prices and softening demand from the export market. According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs the average milk price in August 2016 was 21.34p per litre compared to 31.64p in 2013. The toughening environment prompted Cornish dairy farmers Bill and Rachel Clarke, with the help of a loan from Lloyds Bank, to take the plunge and rebrand their business.

3%

                of the retail market still have milk delivered 
                Footnote2

















Turning it around

Seeing dramatic falls in the price of milk, the pair and their two sons reinvented their business, the Trewithen Dairy, turning their attention from milking their own herd to producing milk products.
A major milestone in the business was a four-year development project funded by Lloyds Bank which was crucial in enabling the growth of the business.
The Clarkes now supply a huge range of shops, restaurants and hotels and is one of Cornwall and Devon’s biggest bottlers of dairy products including clotted cream and yoghurt.
The family pride themselves in only using milk supplied from local farmers within a 25-mile radius to create their award winning products. They value working with farmers who understand the importance of looking after their herd and are supplied with over 100,000 litres of milk every day








When you have a family like the Clarkes, with a vision to build a business like this, it's crucial to have the right funding partner onboard and I think the Bank has proved it has been the right partner throughout this project.

The Group's history stems from the founding in 1695 by the Parliament of Scotland of the Bank of Scotland, which is the second oldest bank in the United Kingdom. The Group's headquarters is located at 25 Gresham Street in the City of London and its registered office is on The Mound in Edinburgh. Lloyds Banking Group's activities are organised into: Retail Banking (including Mortgages and Sole Traders); Commercial; Life, Pensions & Insurance; and Wealth & International. Lloyds' has extensive overseas operations in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Following the takeover, the Group stopped using the name HBOS publicly. The Halifax brand, products and pricing were discontinued in Scotland until reestablished in 2013. The Halifax and Lloyds Bank brands are used in England and Wales and the Bank of Scotland brand is used in Scotland, each offering different products and pricing. Lloyds Banking Group's CEO António Horta-Osório told The Banker, "We will keep the different brands because the customers are very different in terms of attitude".[3]
Lloyds Banking Group is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It had a market capitalisation of approximately GB£57.7billion as of 4 March 2014—the 7th-largest of any LSE company.[4] It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, where it has a market capitalisation value of US$34.45 billion.[5]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
For more details on this topic, see Lloyds Bank and HBOS.
Lloyds Bank was one of the oldest banks in the UK, tracing its establishment to Taylors and Lloyds founded in 1765 in Birmingham by button maker John Taylor and iron producer and dealer Sampson Lloyd II.[6] Through a series of mergers, Lloyds became one of the Big Four banks in the UK.[7]
Bank of Scotland, which originated in the 17th century, is the second-oldest surviving UK bank after the Bank of England. In 2001, a wave of consolidations in the UK banking market led the former Halifax Building Society—which originated in 1853—to agree to a £10.8 billion merger with Bank of Scotland.[8]
Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) can trace its roots back to the first savings bank founded by Henry Duncan in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire in 1810. TSB itself was created in 1985 by an Act of Parliament that merged all the remaining savings banks in England & Wales as TSB Bank plc and in Scotland (except Airdrie Savings Bank) as TSB Scotland plc.[9]
Lloyds/TSB merger[edit]

In 1995, Lloyds Bank merged with TSB, forming Lloyds TSB Group plc.[10]
In 2000, the group acquired Scottish Widows, a mutual life-assurance company based in Edinburgh, in a deal worth £7 billion.[11] This made the group the second-largest UK provider of life assurance and pensions after Prudential. In September the same year, Lloyds TSB purchased Chartered Trust from Standard Chartered Bank for £627 million to form Lloyds TSB Asset Finance Division, which provides motor, retail and personal finance in the United Kingdom under the trading name Black Horse.[12]
Lloyds TSB continued to take part in the consolidation, making a takeover bid for Abbey National in 2001, which was later rejected by the Competition Commission.[13] In October 2003, Lloyds TSB Group agreed on the sale of its subsidiary NBNZ Holdings Limited—comprising the Group's New Zealand banking and insurance operations—to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.[14] In July 2004, Lloyds TSB Group announced the sale of its business in Argentina to Banco Patagonia Sudameris S.A.[15] and its business in Colombia to Primer Banco del Istmo, S.A..[16]
On 20 December 2005, Lloyds TSB announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its credit card business Goldfish to Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited for £175 million.[17] In 2007, Lloyds TSB announced that it had sold its Abbey Life insurance division to Deutsche Bank for £977 million.[18]
Acquisition of HBOS[edit]

On 17 September 2008, the BBC reported that HBOS was in takeover talks with Lloyds TSB, in response to a precipitous drop in HBOS's share price.[19] The talks concluded successfully that evening with a proposal to create a banking giant which would hold a third of UK mortgages.[20] An announcement was made on 18 September 2008.[21][22]
On 19 November 2008, the new acquisition and government preference share purchase was agreed by Lloyds TSB shareholders.[23] HBOS shareholders overwhelming approved the deal on 12 December.[24] Lloyds TSB Group changed its name to Lloyds Banking Group upon completion of the takeover on 19 January 2009.[25]
On 12 February 2009, Eric Daniels, the CEO of the Group, was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons. One of the key issues concerned Lloyds' takeover of HBOS and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition. Daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company, but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition. Losses were slightly more than the £10 billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to write-offs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it. The then-Chairman of Lloyds, Sir Victor Blank, said in August 2009 that losses had been "at the worst end of expectations", and that the Lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losses—which were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late 2008 and early 2009—happened.[26] This position was confirmed by Archie Kane, a senior Lloyds executive in Scotland, in evidence to the Scottish parliament's economy committee in December 2009.[27]
On 13 February 2009, Lloyds Banking Group said that the losses at HBOS were greater than had been anticipated, at around £10 billion. The share price of Lloyds Banking Group fell 32% on the London Stock Exchange, carrying other bank shares with it.[28]

On 13 October 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a government plan for the Treasury to invest £37 billion (US$64 billion, €47 billion) of new capital into major UK banks—including Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Lloyds TSB and HBOS—to avert a collapse of the financial sector.[29][30] Barclays avoided taking a capital investment from the UK Government by raising capital privately and HSBC moved capital to its UK business from its other businesses overseas.[31]
It was later confirmed that Lloyds TSB would have been required by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to take additional capital from the government if it had not taken over HBOS.[32] After the recapitalisations and Lloyds' acquisition of HBOS, the UK Government held a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group.[33]
February to June 2009[edit]
In February 2009, after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated, the FSA was instructed to "stress test" the banks against a severe economic downturn. The FSA stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen, but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario. These assumptions included:

A peak-to-trough fall in UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of over 6%, with no growth until 2011 and returning to trend-rate growth in 2012;
A rise in UK unemployment to just over 12%;
A 50% peak-to-trough fall in UK house prices;
A 60% peak-to-trough fall in UK commercial property prices.[34]

The conclusion from this exercise was that Lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred. Because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time, in March 2009 Lloyds made a deal with the UK government consisting of two elements:

Redemption of Preference Shares. The £4 billion of preference (non-voting) shares held by UKFI were repaid on 8 June 2009 following the issue of new ordinary shares—this avoided the payment of £480 million annual interest to the Treasury and allowed Lloyds to resume payment of dividends when profits allowed. These new ordinary shares were initially available to existing shareholders through an Open Offer at 38.43 pence that closed on 5 June 2009—87% were taken up. The remaining 13% were placed in the market on 8 June 2009 at 60 pence. This Open Offer and Placing was underwritten by the Treasury; if none of these new ordinary shares had been bought by existing shareholders or the open market, the government—as underwriters of the deal—would have bought them and their shareholding would have increased to a maximum of 65%. This did not happen; the government's holding remained at 43.4% and Lloyds became the first European bank to repay government "credit crunch" investment.[35] Following the government's 43.4% participation in June's Open Offer, the average buying price of the government's total shareholding was 122.6 pence.[36]
Asset Protection Scheme. Lloyds agreed in principle to enter the government's Asset Protection Scheme to insure it against potential future losses on previous loans—primarily on the old HBOS portfolio. The fee for this would have been paid for by the issue to the government of new 'B' (non-voting) shares, which could have increased the government holding to a maximum of c.62%—or higher if the government had bought all the ordinary shares issued to redeem the preference shares.[37]

June 2009 to present[edit]

Lloyds impairments peaked in the first half of 2009; by mid-2009 the Asset Protection Scheme increasingly looked like a poor deal for Lloyds. Following negotiations, the government confirmed on 3 November 2009 that Lloyds would not enter the scheme—although RBS still would. Instead, Lloyds launched a rights issue to raise capital from existing shareholders; as an existing 43.4% shareholder the government chose to take part in this and thus maintained its shareholding at 43.4%.[40][41] Following this, the National Audit Office calculated the government's average buying price for its entire stake in Lloyds to be about 74 pence.[42]
It was announced in the Government's Pre-Budget Report on 9 December 2009 that the forecast for the total loss to taxpayers for all the bank bailouts had been reduced from £50 billion to £10 billion—in part because of the restructuring of the Government's Asset Protection Scheme.[43] The final part of the December 2009 capital raise involved issuing new shares to debt holders in February 2010. This diluted existing shareholders—including the UK Government, whose shareholding was reduced from 43.4% to around 41%.[44] According to the Accord trade union general secretary Ged Nichols, Lloyds Banking Group had cut 30,000 jobs between February 2009 and August 2011; and in August 2011 it announced another 1,300 job losses.[45] The group sold its 70% stake in insurance company Esure to Esure Group Holdings on 11 February 2010. The share was valued at around £185 million.[46]
On 4 November 2012, it was reported that Lloyds was considering selling its 60% stake in St James's Place Wealth Management to raise around £1 billion.[47] In April 2013, Lloyds sold its loss-making Spanish retail operation—originally Banco Halifax Hispania—and the local investment management business in Spain to Banco de Sabadell. Lloyds will receive a 1.8% stake in Sabadell worth about €84 million and an additional sum of up to €20 million over the next five years.[48] In September 2013, it was reported that the UK government was planning to sell up to a quarter of its shares in Lloyds Banking Group.[49] The government sold 6% of its shares on 17 September 2013 at 75p, raising £3.2 billion and reducing its stake to 32.7%.[50] The UK government then sold a further 7.8% on 26 March 2014 at 75.5p raising a further £4.2bn and reducing its stake to 24.9%.[51] A trading plan of incremental sales during 2015 reduced the publicly owned stake to below 10% by the end of October.[52] Sales resumed in November 2016, as the holding was reduced to 7.99%.[53] On 17 March 2017, the British Government confirmed its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group had been sold.[54]
Divestment[edit]
Main article: TSB Bank (United Kingdom)

The UK Government's purchase of a 43.4% stake in the group in 2009 was considered as state aid; under European Commission competition laws, the group would be required to sell a portion of its business.[56] The group's divestment plan—codenamed "Verde"—identified 632 branches which would be transferred to a new business. Customers with accounts held by the branches, and staff employed within them, would be transferred. The new business would be formed from some Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales, all branches of Lloyds TSB Scotland plc and Cheltenham & Gloucester plc; these would operate under the TSB brand as TSB Bank plc.[57] The remainder of the Lloyds TSB business would be rebranded as Lloyds Bank.[58]
Lloyds Banking Group reached a Heads of Terms agreement in July 2012 to sell the Verde branches to The Co-operative Bank for £750 million.[59][60] The final transfer of TSB Bank plc to the new owner was due to be completed by late 2013. In February 2013, it was reported that Lloyds Banking Group were considering a stock market flotation of the TSB business as an alternative, should the transfer not be completed.[61] On 24 April 2013, The Co-operative Bank decided not to proceed with the acquisition because of the economic downturn and the tough regulatory environment imposed on banks. Lloyds Banking Group said that the rebranding to TSB Bank would still take place and that the new bank will be divested through an initial public offering in 2014.[62] TSB Bank began operations on 9 September 2013, under CEO Paul Pester.[63]
Lloyds Banking Group announced that 25% of TSB's shares would be floated on 24 June 2014;[64] however, with the offer being 10 times oversubscribed, 35% of TSB's shares were sold at 260p on 20 June.[65] Banco Sabadell agreed to purchase TSB in March 2015, and completed the acquisition on 8 July 2015. The purchase meant Lloyds sold its final holding in TSB.[66][67]

Controversies[edit]

Money laundering[edit]
A 2010 report by the Wall Street Journal described how Credit Suisse, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, and other banks were involved in helping the Alavi Foundation, Bank Melli, the Government of Iran, and others circumvent US laws banning financial transactions with certain states. They did this by stripping information out of wire transfers, thereby concealing the source of funds. Lloyds Banking Group settled with the US government for US$350 million. The US government's Manhattan District Attorney's Office was involved, although the case was merged with one at the federal US Department of Justice. [85]
Tax avoidance[edit]
In 2009, a case was brought against Lloyds by HM Revenue and Customs on grounds of tax avoidance. Lloyds was accused of pouring hundreds of millions of pounds into transatlantic tax avoidance schemes in the form of loans to American financial institutions.[86]
Complaints via the Financial Ombudsman Service[edit]
Lloyds TSB received 9,952 complaints via the Financial Ombudsman Service in the last half of 2009. This, when added to the other brands of the Lloyds Banking Group, was twice the number of complaints received by Barclays—the next-most-complained-about UK bank. The Financial Ombudsman Service upheld fewer complaints against Lloyds TSB than it did against Barclays.[87]
Sharia account[edit]
Lloyds TSB became the first mainstream UK bank to launch a sharia-compliant business account. The Islamic Business and Corporate account was to be run in line with sharia principles,[88] which has resulted in some controversy.[89]
HBOS fraud[edit]
Lloyds Banking Group has been criticised for failing to compensate, or even apologise to, victims of fraud perpetrated by employees of HBOS.[90][91]

Lloyds Banking Group plc is a major British financial institution formed through the acquisition of HBOS by Lloyds TSB in 2009. The Group's history stems from the founding in 1695 by the Parliament of Scotland of the Bank of Scotland, which is the second oldest bank in the United Kingdom. The Group's headquarters is located at 25 Gresham Street in the City of London and its registered office is on The Mound in Edinburgh. Lloyds Banking Group's activities are organised into: Retail Banking (including Mortgages and Sole Traders); Commercial; Life, Pensions & Insurance; and Wealth & International. Lloyds' has extensive overseas operations in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Following the takeover, the Group stopped using the name HBOS publicly. The Halifax brand, products and pricing were discontinued in Scotland until reestablished in 2013. The Halifax and Lloyds Bank brands are used in England and Wales and the Bank of Scotland brand is used in Scotland, each offering different products and pricing. Lloyds Banking Group's CEO António Horta-Osório told The Banker, "We will keep the different brands because the customers are very different in terms of attitude".[3]
Lloyds Banking Group is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It had a market capitalisation of approximately GB£57.7billion as of 4 March 2014—the 7th-largest of any LSE company.[4] It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, where it has a market capitalisation value of US$34.45 billion.[5]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
For more details on this topic, see Lloyds Bank and HBOS.
Lloyds Bank was one of the oldest banks in the UK, tracing its establishment to Taylors and Lloyds founded in 1765 in Birmingham by button maker John Taylor and iron producer and dealer Sampson Lloyd II.[6] Through a series of mergers, Lloyds became one of the Big Four banks in the UK.[7]
Bank of Scotland, which originated in the 17th century, is the second-oldest surviving UK bank after the Bank of England. In 2001, a wave of consolidations in the UK banking market led the former Halifax Building Society—which originated in 1853—to agree to a £10.8 billion merger with Bank of Scotland.[8]
Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) can trace its roots back to the first savings bank founded by Henry Duncan in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire in 1810. TSB itself was created in 1985 by an Act of Parliament that merged all the remaining savings banks in England & Wales as TSB Bank plc and in Scotland (except Airdrie Savings Bank) as TSB Scotland plc.[9]
Lloyds/TSB merger[edit]

In 1995, Lloyds Bank merged with TSB, forming Lloyds TSB Group plc.[10]
In 2000, the group acquired Scottish Widows, a mutual life-assurance company based in Edinburgh, in a deal worth £7 billion.[11] This made the group the second-largest UK provider of life assurance and pensions after Prudential. In September the same year, Lloyds TSB purchased Chartered Trust from Standard Chartered Bank for £627 million to form Lloyds TSB Asset Finance Division, which provides motor, retail and personal finance in the United Kingdom under the trading name Black Horse.[12]
Lloyds TSB continued to take part in the consolidation, making a takeover bid for Abbey National in 2001, which was later rejected by the Competition Commission.[13] In October 2003, Lloyds TSB Group agreed on the sale of its subsidiary NBNZ Holdings Limited—comprising the Group's New Zealand banking and insurance operations—to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.[14] In July 2004, Lloyds TSB Group announced the sale of its business in Argentina to Banco Patagonia Sudameris S.A.[15] and its business in Colombia to Primer Banco del Istmo, S.A..[16]
On 20 December 2005, Lloyds TSB announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its credit card business Goldfish to Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited for £175 million.[17] In 2007, Lloyds TSB announced that it had sold its Abbey Life insurance division to Deutsche Bank for £977 million.[18]
Acquisition of HBOS[edit]

On 17 September 2008, the BBC reported that HBOS was in takeover talks with Lloyds TSB, in response to a precipitous drop in HBOS's share price.[19] The talks concluded successfully that evening with a proposal to create a banking giant which would hold a third of UK mortgages.[20] An announcement was made on 18 September 2008.[21][22]
On 19 November 2008, the new acquisition and government preference share purchase was agreed by Lloyds TSB shareholders.[23] HBOS shareholders overwhelming approved the deal on 12 December.[24] Lloyds TSB Group changed its name to Lloyds Banking Group upon completion of the takeover on 19 January 2009.[25]
On 12 February 2009, Eric Daniels, the CEO of the Group, was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons. One of the key issues concerned Lloyds' takeover of HBOS and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition. Daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company, but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition. Losses were slightly more than the £10 billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to write-offs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it. The then-Chairman of Lloyds, Sir Victor Blank, said in August 2009 that losses had been "at the worst end of expectations", and that the Lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losses—which were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late 2008 and early 2009—happened.[26] This position was confirmed by Archie Kane, a senior Lloyds executive in Scotland, in evidence to the Scottish parliament's economy committee in December 2009.[27]
On 13 February 2009, Lloyds Banking Group said that the losses at HBOS were greater than had been anticipated, at around £10 billion. The share price of Lloyds Banking Group fell 32% on the London Stock Exchange, carrying other bank shares with it.[28]

On 13 October 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a government plan for the Treasury to invest £37 billion (US$64 billion, €47 billion) of new capital into major UK banks—including Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Lloyds TSB and HBOS—to avert a collapse of the financial sector.[29][30] Barclays avoided taking a capital investment from the UK Government by raising capital privately and HSBC moved capital to its UK business from its other businesses overseas.[31]
It was later confirmed that Lloyds TSB would have been required by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to take additional capital from the government if it had not taken over HBOS.[32] After the recapitalisations and Lloyds' acquisition of HBOS, the UK Government held a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group.[33]
February to June 2009[edit]
In February 2009, after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated, the FSA was instructed to "stress test" the banks against a severe economic downturn. The FSA stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen, but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario. These assumptions included:

A peak-to-trough fall in UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of over 6%, with no growth until 2011 and returning to trend-rate growth in 2012;
A rise in UK unemployment to just over 12%;
A 50% peak-to-trough fall in UK house prices;
A 60% peak-to-trough fall in UK commercial property prices.[34]

The conclusion from this exercise was that Lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred. Because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time, in March 2009 Lloyds made a deal with the UK government consisting of two elements:

Redemption of Preference Shares. The £4 billion of preference (non-voting) shares held by UKFI were repaid on 8 June 2009 following the issue of new ordinary shares—this avoided the payment of £480 million annual interest to the Treasury and allowed Lloyds to resume payment of dividends when profits allowed. These new ordinary shares were initially available to existing shareholders through an Open Offer at 38.43 pence that closed on 5 June 2009—87% were taken up. The remaining 13% were placed in the market on 8 June 2009 at 60 pence. This Open Offer and Placing was underwritten by the Treasury; if none of these new ordinary shares had been bought by existing shareholders or the open market, the government—as underwriters of the deal—would have bought them and their shareholding would have increased to a maximum of 65%. This did not happen; the government's holding remained at 43.4% and Lloyds became the first European bank to repay government "credit crunch" investment.[35] Following the government's 43.4% participation in June's Open Offer, the average buying price of the government's total shareholding was 122.6 pence.[36]
Asset Protection Scheme. Lloyds agreed in principle to enter the government's Asset Protection Scheme to insure it against potential future losses on previous loans—primarily on the old HBOS portfolio. The fee for this would have been paid for by the issue to the government of new 'B' (non-voting) shares, which could have increased the government holding to a maximum of c.62%—or higher if the government had bought all the ordinary shares issued to redeem the preference shares.[37]

June 2009 to present[edit]

Lloyds impairments peaked in the first half of 2009; by mid-2009 the Asset Protection Scheme increasingly looked like a poor deal for Lloyds. Following negotiations, the government confirmed on 3 November 2009 that Lloyds would not enter the scheme—although RBS still would. Instead, Lloyds launched a rights issue to raise capital from existing shareholders; as an existing 43.4% shareholder the government chose to take part in this and thus maintained its shareholding at 43.4%.[40][41] Following this, the National Audit Office calculated the government's average buying price for its entire stake in Lloyds to be about 74 pence.[42]
It was announced in the Government's Pre-Budget Report on 9 December 2009 that the forecast for the total loss to taxpayers for all the bank bailouts had been reduced from £50 billion to £10 billion—in part because of the restructuring of the Government's Asset Protection Scheme.[43] The final part of the December 2009 capital raise involved issuing new shares to debt holders in February 2010. This diluted existing shareholders—including the UK Government, whose shareholding was reduced from 43.4% to around 41%.[44] According to the Accord trade union general secretary Ged Nichols, Lloyds Banking Group had cut 30,000 jobs between February 2009 and August 2011; and in August 2011 it announced another 1,300 job losses.[45] The group sold its 70% stake in insurance company Esure to Esure Group Holdings on 11 February 2010. The share was valued at around £185 million.[46]
On 4 November 2012, it was reported that Lloyds was considering selling its 60% stake in St James's Place Wealth Management to raise around £1 billion.[47] In April 2013, Lloyds sold its loss-making Spanish retail operation—originally Banco Halifax Hispania—and the local investment management business in Spain to Banco de Sabadell. Lloyds will receive a 1.8% stake in Sabadell worth about €84 million and an additional sum of up to €20 million over the next five years.[48] In September 2013, it was reported that the UK government was planning to sell up to a quarter of its shares in Lloyds Banking Group.[49] The government sold 6% of its shares on 17 September 2013 at 75p, raising £3.2 billion and reducing its stake to 32.7%.[50] The UK government then sold a further 7.8% on 26 March 2014 at 75.5p raising a further £4.2bn and reducing its stake to 24.9%.[51] A trading plan of incremental sales during 2015 reduced the publicly owned stake to below 10% by the end of October.[52] Sales resumed in November 2016, as the holding was reduced to 7.99%.[53] On 17 March 2017, the British Government confirmed its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group had been sold.[54]
Divestment[edit]
Main article: TSB Bank (United Kingdom)




The Edgbaston branch of Lloyds Bank at Five Ways, Birmingham, designed by P. B. Chatwin in 1908.[55]


The UK Government's purchase of a 43.4% stake in the group in 2009 was considered as state aid; under European Commission competition laws, the group would be required to sell a portion of its business.[56] The group's divestment plan—codenamed "Verde"—identified 632 branches which would be transferred to a new business. Customers with accounts held by the branches, and staff employed within them, would be transferred. The new business would be formed from some Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales, all branches of Lloyds TSB Scotland plc and Cheltenham & Gloucester plc; these would operate under the TSB brand as TSB Bank plc.[57] The remainder of the Lloyds TSB business would be rebranded as Lloyds Bank.[58]
Lloyds Banking Group reached a Heads of Terms agreement in July 2012 to sell the Verde branches to The Co-operative Bank for £750 million.[59][60] The final transfer of TSB Bank plc to the new owner was due to be completed by late 2013. In February 2013, it was reported that Lloyds Banking Group were considering a stock market flotation of the TSB business as an alternative, should the transfer not be completed.[61] On 24 April 2013, The Co-operative Bank decided not to proceed with the acquisition because of the economic downturn and the tough regulatory environment imposed on banks. Lloyds Banking Group said that the rebranding to TSB Bank would still take place and that the new bank will be divested through an initial public offering in 2014.[62] TSB Bank began operations on 9 September 2013, under CEO Paul Pester.[63]
Lloyds Banking Group announced that 25% of TSB's shares would be floated on 24 June 2014;[64] however, with the offer being 10 times oversubscribed, 35% of TSB's shares were sold at 260p on 20 June.[65] Banco Sabadell agreed to purchase TSB in March 2015, and completed the acquisition on 8 July 2015. The purchase meant Lloyds sold its final holding in TSB.[66][67]

Controversies[edit]




The Halifax branch of Lloyds Bank on George Square, built 1897.[84]


Money laundering[edit]
A 2010 report by the Wall Street Journal described how Credit Suisse, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, and other banks were involved in helping the Alavi Foundation, Bank Melli, the Government of Iran, and others circumvent US laws banning financial transactions with certain states. They did this by stripping information out of wire transfers, thereby concealing the source of funds. Lloyds Banking Group settled with the US government for US$350 million. The US government's Manhattan District Attorney's Office was involved, although the case was merged with one at the federal US Department of Justice. [85]
Tax avoidance[edit]
In 2009, a case was brought against Lloyds by HM Revenue and Customs on grounds of tax avoidance. Lloyds was accused of pouring hundreds of millions of pounds into transatlantic tax avoidance schemes in the form of loans to American financial institutions.[86]
Complaints via the Financial Ombudsman Service[edit]
Lloyds TSB received 9,952 complaints via the Financial Ombudsman Service in the last half of 2009. This, when added to the other brands of the Lloyds Banking Group, was twice the number of complaints received by Barclays—the next-most-complained-about UK bank. The Financial Ombudsman Service upheld fewer complaints against Lloyds TSB than it did against Barclays.[87]
Sharia account[edit]
Lloyds TSB became the first mainstream UK bank to launch a sharia-compliant business account. The Islamic Business and Corporate account was to be run in line with sharia principles,[88] which has resulted in some controversy.[89]
HBOS fraud[edit]
Lloyds Banking Group has been criticised for failing to compensate, or even apologise to, victims of fraud perpetrated by employees of HBOS.[90][91]

Lloyds Banking Group plc is a major British financial institution formed through the acquisition of HBOS by Lloyds TSB in 2009. The Group's history stems from the founding in 1695 by the Parliament of Scotland of the Bank of Scotland, which is the second oldest bank in the United Kingdom. The Group's headquarters is located at 25 Gresham Street in the City of London and its registered office is on The Mound in Edinburgh. Lloyds Banking Group's activities are organised into: Retail Banking (including Mortgages and Sole Traders); Commercial; Life, Pensions & Insurance; and Wealth & International. Lloyds' has extensive overseas operations in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Following the takeover, the Group stopped using the name HBOS publicly. The Halifax brand, products and pricing were discontinued in Scotland until reestablished in 2013. The Halifax and Lloyds Bank brands are used in England and Wales and the Bank of Scotland brand is used in Scotland, each offering different products and pricing. Lloyds Banking Group's CEO António Horta-Osório told The Banker, "We will keep the different brands because the customers are very different in terms of attitude".[3]
Lloyds Banking Group is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It had a market capitalisation of approximately GB£57.7billion as of 4 March 2014—the 7th-largest of any LSE company.[4] It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, where it has a market capitalisation value of US$34.45 billion.[5]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
For more details on this topic, see Lloyds Bank and HBOS.
Lloyds Bank was one of the oldest banks in the UK, tracing its establishment to Taylors and Lloyds founded in 1765 in Birmingham by button maker John Taylor and iron producer and dealer Sampson Lloyd II.[6] Through a series of mergers, Lloyds became one of the Big Four banks in the UK.[7]
Bank of Scotland, which originated in the 17th century, is the second-oldest surviving UK bank after the Bank of England. In 2001, a wave of consolidations in the UK banking market led the former Halifax Building Society—which originated in 1853—to agree to a £10.8 billion merger with Bank of Scotland.[8]
Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) can trace its roots back to the first savings bank founded by Henry Duncan in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire in 1810. TSB itself was created in 1985 by an Act of Parliament that merged all the remaining savings banks in England & Wales as TSB Bank plc and in Scotland (except Airdrie Savings Bank) as TSB Scotland plc.[9]
Lloyds/TSB merger[edit]

In 1995, Lloyds Bank merged with TSB, forming Lloyds TSB Group plc.[10]
In 2000, the group acquired Scottish Widows, a mutual life-assurance company based in Edinburgh, in a deal worth £7 billion.[11] This made the group the second-largest UK provider of life assurance and pensions after Prudential. In September the same year, Lloyds TSB purchased Chartered Trust from Standard Chartered Bank for £627 million to form Lloyds TSB Asset Finance Division, which provides motor, retail and personal finance in the United Kingdom under the trading name Black Horse.[12]
Lloyds TSB continued to take part in the consolidation, making a takeover bid for Abbey National in 2001, which was later rejected by the Competition Commission.[13] In October 2003, Lloyds TSB Group agreed on the sale of its subsidiary NBNZ Holdings Limited—comprising the Group's New Zealand banking and insurance operations—to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.[14] In July 2004, Lloyds TSB Group announced the sale of its business in Argentina to Banco Patagonia Sudameris S.A.[15] and its business in Colombia to Primer Banco del Istmo, S.A..[16]
On 20 December 2005, Lloyds TSB announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its credit card business Goldfish to Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited for £175 million.[17] In 2007, Lloyds TSB announced that it had sold its Abbey Life insurance division to Deutsche Bank for £977 million.[18]
Acquisition of HBOS[edit]

On 17 September 2008, the BBC reported that HBOS was in takeover talks with Lloyds TSB, in response to a precipitous drop in HBOS's share price.[19] The talks concluded successfully that evening with a proposal to create a banking giant which would hold a third of UK mortgages.[20] An announcement was made on 18 September 2008.[21][22]
On 19 November 2008, the new acquisition and government preference share purchase was agreed by Lloyds TSB shareholders.[23] HBOS shareholders overwhelming approved the deal on 12 December.[24] Lloyds TSB Group changed its name to Lloyds Banking Group upon completion of the takeover on 19 January 2009.[25]
On 12 February 2009, Eric Daniels, the CEO of the Group, was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons. One of the key issues concerned Lloyds' takeover of HBOS and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition. Daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company, but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition. Losses were slightly more than the £10 billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to write-offs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it. The then-Chairman of Lloyds, Sir Victor Blank, said in August 2009 that losses had been "at the worst end of expectations", and that the Lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losses—which were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late 2008 and early 2009—happened.[26] This position was confirmed by Archie Kane, a senior Lloyds executive in Scotland, in evidence to the Scottish parliament's economy committee in December 2009.[27]
On 13 February 2009, Lloyds Banking Group said that the losses at HBOS were greater than had been anticipated, at around £10 billion. The share price of Lloyds Banking Group fell 32% on the London Stock Exchange, carrying other bank shares with it.[28]

On 13 October 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a government plan for the Treasury to invest £37 billion (US$64 billion, €47 billion) of new capital into major UK banks—including Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Lloyds TSB and HBOS—to avert a collapse of the financial sector.[29][30] Barclays avoided taking a capital investment from the UK Government by raising capital privately and HSBC moved capital to its UK business from its other businesses overseas.[31]
It was later confirmed that Lloyds TSB would have been required by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to take additional capital from the government if it had not taken over HBOS.[32] After the recapitalisations and Lloyds' acquisition of HBOS, the UK Government held a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group.[33]
February to June 2009[edit]
In February 2009, after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated, the FSA was instructed to "stress test" the banks against a severe economic downturn. The FSA stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen, but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario. These assumptions included:

A peak-to-trough fall in UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of over 6%, with no growth until 2011 and returning to trend-rate growth in 2012;
A rise in UK unemployment to just over 12%;
A 50% peak-to-trough fall in UK house prices;
A 60% peak-to-trough fall in UK commercial property prices.[34]

The conclusion from this exercise was that Lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred. Because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time, in March 2009 Lloyds made a deal with the UK government consisting of two elements:

Redemption of Preference Shares. The £4 billion of preference (non-voting) shares held by UKFI were repaid on 8 June 2009 following the issue of new ordinary shares—this avoided the payment of £480 million annual interest to the Treasury and allowed Lloyds to resume payment of dividends when profits allowed. These new ordinary shares were initially available to existing shareholders through an Open Offer at 38.43 pence that closed on 5 June 2009—87% were taken up. The remaining 13% were placed in the market on 8 June 2009 at 60 pence. This Open Offer and Placing was underwritten by the Treasury; if none of these new ordinary shares had been bought by existing shareholders or the open market, the government—as underwriters of the deal—would have bought them and their shareholding would have increased to a maximum of 65%. This did not happen; the government's holding remained at 43.4% and Lloyds became the first European bank to repay government "credit crunch" investment.[35] Following the government's 43.4% participation in June's Open Offer, the average buying price of the government's total shareholding was 122.6 pence.[36]
Asset Protection Scheme. Lloyds agreed in principle to enter the government's Asset Protection Scheme to insure it against potential future losses on previous loans—primarily on the old HBOS portfolio. The fee for this would have been paid for by the issue to the government of new 'B' (non-voting) shares, which could have increased the government holding to a maximum of c.62%—or higher if the government had bought all the ordinary shares issued to redeem the preference shares.[37]

June 2009 to present[edit]

Lloyds impairments peaked in the first half of 2009; by mid-2009 the Asset Protection Scheme increasingly looked like a poor deal for Lloyds. Following negotiations, the government confirmed on 3 November 2009 that Lloyds would not enter the scheme—although RBS still would. Instead, Lloyds launched a rights issue to raise capital from existing shareholders; as an existing 43.4% shareholder the government chose to take part in this and thus maintained its shareholding at 43.4%.[40][41] Following this, the National Audit Office calculated the government's average buying price for its entire stake in Lloyds to be about 74 pence.[42]
It was announced in the Government's Pre-Budget Report on 9 December 2009 that the forecast for the total loss to taxpayers for all the bank bailouts had been reduced from £50 billion to £10 billion—in part because of the restructuring of the Government's Asset Protection Scheme.[43] The final part of the December 2009 capital raise involved issuing new shares to debt holders in February 2010. This diluted existing shareholders—including the UK Government, whose shareholding was reduced from 43.4% to around 41%.[44] According to the Accord trade union general secretary Ged Nichols, Lloyds Banking Group had cut 30,000 jobs between February 2009 and August 2011; and in August 2011 it announced another 1,300 job losses.[45] The group sold its 70% stake in insurance company Esure to Esure Group Holdings on 11 February 2010. The share was valued at around £185 million.[46]
On 4 November 2012, it was reported that Lloyds was considering selling its 60% stake in St James's Place Wealth Management to raise around £1 billion.[47] In April 2013, Lloyds sold its loss-making Spanish retail operation—originally Banco Halifax Hispania—and the local investment management business in Spain to Banco de Sabadell. Lloyds will receive a 1.8% stake in Sabadell worth about €84 million and an additional sum of up to €20 million over the next five years.[48] In September 2013, it was reported that the UK government was planning to sell up to a quarter of its shares in Lloyds Banking Group.[49] The government sold 6% of its shares on 17 September 2013 at 75p, raising £3.2 billion and reducing its stake to 32.7%.[50] The UK government then sold a further 7.8% on 26 March 2014 at 75.5p raising a further £4.2bn and reducing its stake to 24.9%.[51] A trading plan of incremental sales during 2015 reduced the publicly owned stake to below 10% by the end of October.[52] Sales resumed in November 2016, as the holding was reduced to 7.99%.[53] On 17 March 2017, the British Government confirmed its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group had been sold.[54]
Divestment[edit]
Main article: TSB Bank (United Kingdom)

The UK Government's purchase of a 43.4% stake in the group in 2009 was considered as state aid; under European Commission competition laws, the group would be required to sell a portion of its business.[56] The group's divestment plan—codenamed "Verde"—identified 632 branches which would be transferred to a new business. Customers with accounts held by the branches, and staff employed within them, would be transferred. The new business would be formed from some Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales, all branches of Lloyds TSB Scotland plc and Cheltenham & Gloucester plc; these would operate under the TSB brand as TSB Bank plc.[57] The remainder of the Lloyds TSB business would be rebranded as Lloyds Bank.[58]
Lloyds Banking Group reached a Heads of Terms agreement in July 2012 to sell the Verde branches to The Co-operative Bank for £750 million.[59][60] The final transfer of TSB Bank plc to the new owner was due to be completed by late 2013. In February 2013, it was reported that Lloyds Banking Group were considering a stock market flotation of the TSB business as an alternative, should the transfer not be completed.[61] On 24 April 2013, The Co-operative Bank decided not to proceed with the acquisition because of the economic downturn and the tough regulatory environment imposed on banks. Lloyds Banking Group said that the rebranding to TSB Bank would still take place and that the new bank will be divested through an initial public offering in 2014.[62] TSB Bank began operations on 9 September 2013, under CEO Paul Pester.[63]
Lloyds Banking Group announced that 25% of TSB's shares would be floated on 24 June 2014;[64] however, with the offer being 10 times oversubscribed, 35% of TSB's shares were sold at 260p on 20 June.[65] Banco Sabadell agreed to purchase TSB in March 2015, and completed the acquisition on 8 July 2015. The purchase meant Lloyds sold its final holding in TSB.[66][67]

Controversies[edit]




The Halifax branch of Lloyds Bank on George Square, built 1897.[84]


Money laundering[edit]
A 2010 report by the Wall Street Journal described how Credit Suisse, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, and other banks were involved in helping the Alavi Foundation, Bank Melli, the Government of Iran, and others circumvent US laws banning financial transactions with certain states. They did this by stripping information out of wire transfers, thereby concealing the source of funds. Lloyds Banking Group settled with the US government for US$350 million. The US government's Manhattan District Attorney's Office was involved, although the case was merged with one at the federal US Department of Justice. [85]
Tax avoidance[edit]
In 2009, a case was brought against Lloyds by HM Revenue and Customs on grounds of tax avoidance. Lloyds was accused of pouring hundreds of millions of pounds into transatlantic tax avoidance schemes in the form of loans to American financial institutions.[86]
Complaints via the Financial Ombudsman Service[edit]
Lloyds TSB received 9,952 complaints via the Financial Ombudsman Service in the last half of 2009. This, when added to the other brands of the Lloyds Banking Group, was twice the number of complaints received by Barclays—the next-most-complained-about UK bank. The Financial Ombudsman Service upheld fewer complaints against Lloyds TSB than it did against Barclays.[87]
Sharia account[edit]
Lloyds TSB became the first mainstream UK bank to launch a sharia-compliant business account. The Islamic Business and Corporate account was to be run in line with sharia principles,[88] which has resulted in some controversy.[89]
HBOS fraud[edit]
Lloyds Banking Group has been criticised for failing to compensate, or even apologise to, victims of fraud perpetrated by employees of HBOS.[90][91]

Lloyds Banking Group plc is a major British financial institution formed through the acquisition of HBOS by Lloyds TSB in 2009. The Group's history stems from the founding in 1695 by the Parliament of Scotland of the Bank of Scotland, which is the second oldest bank in the United Kingdom. The Group's headquarters is located at 25 Gresham Street in the City of London and its registered office is on The Mound in Edinburgh. Lloyds Banking Group's activities are organised into: Retail Banking (including Mortgages and Sole Traders); Commercial; Life, Pensions & Insurance; and Wealth & International. Lloyds' has extensive overseas operations in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Following the takeover, the Group stopped using the name HBOS publicly. The Halifax brand, products and pricing were discontinued in Scotland until reestablished in 2013. The Halifax and Lloyds Bank brands are used in England and Wales and the Bank of Scotland brand is used in Scotland, each offering different products and pricing. Lloyds Banking Group's CEO António Horta-Osório told The Banker, "We will keep the different brands because the customers are very different in terms of attitude".[3]
Lloyds Banking Group is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It had a market capitalisation of approximately GB£57.7billion as of 4 March 2014—the 7th-largest of any LSE company.[4] It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, where it has a market capitalisation value of US$34.45 billion.[5]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
For more details on this topic, see Lloyds Bank and HBOS.
Lloyds Bank was one of the oldest banks in the UK, tracing its establishment to Taylors and Lloyds founded in 1765 in Birmingham by button maker John Taylor and iron producer and dealer Sampson Lloyd II.[6] Through a series of mergers, Lloyds became one of the Big Four banks in the UK.[7]
Bank of Scotland, which originated in the 17th century, is the second-oldest surviving UK bank after the Bank of England. In 2001, a wave of consolidations in the UK banking market led the former Halifax Building Society—which originated in 1853—to agree to a £10.8 billion merger with Bank of Scotland.[8]
Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) can trace its roots back to the first savings bank founded by Henry Duncan in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire in 1810. TSB itself was created in 1985 by an Act of Parliament that merged all the remaining savings banks in England & Wales as TSB Bank plc and in Scotland (except Airdrie Savings Bank) as TSB Scotland plc.[9]
Lloyds/TSB merger[edit]

In 1995, Lloyds Bank merged with TSB, forming Lloyds TSB Group plc.[10]
In 2000, the group acquired Scottish Widows, a mutual life-assurance company based in Edinburgh, in a deal worth £7 billion.[11] This made the group the second-largest UK provider of life assurance and pensions after Prudential. In September the same year, Lloyds TSB purchased Chartered Trust from Standard Chartered Bank for £627 million to form Lloyds TSB Asset Finance Division, which provides motor, retail and personal finance in the United Kingdom under the trading name Black Horse.[12]
Lloyds TSB continued to take part in the consolidation, making a takeover bid for Abbey National in 2001, which was later rejected by the Competition Commission.[13] In October 2003, Lloyds TSB Group agreed on the sale of its subsidiary NBNZ Holdings Limited—comprising the Group's New Zealand banking and insurance operations—to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.[14] In July 2004, Lloyds TSB Group announced the sale of its business in Argentina to Banco Patagonia Sudameris S.A.[15] and its business in Colombia to Primer Banco del Istmo, S.A..[16]
On 20 December 2005, Lloyds TSB announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its credit card business Goldfish to Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited for £175 million.[17] In 2007, Lloyds TSB announced that it had sold its Abbey Life insurance division to Deutsche Bank for £977 million.[18]
Acquisition of HBOS[edit]

On 17 September 2008, the BBC reported that HBOS was in takeover talks with Lloyds TSB, in response to a precipitous drop in HBOS's share price.[19] The talks concluded successfully that evening with a proposal to create a banking giant which would hold a third of UK mortgages.[20] An announcement was made on 18 September 2008.[21][22]
On 19 November 2008, the new acquisition and government preference share purchase was agreed by Lloyds TSB shareholders.[23] HBOS shareholders overwhelming approved the deal on 12 December.[24] Lloyds TSB Group changed its name to Lloyds Banking Group upon completion of the takeover on 19 January 2009.[25]
On 12 February 2009, Eric Daniels, the CEO of the Group, was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons. One of the key issues concerned Lloyds' takeover of HBOS and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition. Daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company, but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition. Losses were slightly more than the £10 billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to write-offs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it. The then-Chairman of Lloyds, Sir Victor Blank, said in August 2009 that losses had been "at the worst end of expectations", and that the Lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losses—which were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late 2008 and early 2009—happened.[26] This position was confirmed by Archie Kane, a senior Lloyds executive in Scotland, in evidence to the Scottish parliament's economy committee in December 2009.[27]
On 13 February 2009, Lloyds Banking Group said that the losses at HBOS were greater than had been anticipated, at around £10 billion. The share price of Lloyds Banking Group fell 32% on the London Stock Exchange, carrying other bank shares with it.[28]

On 13 October 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a government plan for the Treasury to invest £37 billion (US$64 billion, €47 billion) of new capital into major UK banks—including Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Lloyds TSB and HBOS—to avert a collapse of the financial sector.[29][30] Barclays avoided taking a capital investment from the UK Government by raising capital privately and HSBC moved capital to its UK business from its other businesses overseas.[31]
It was later confirmed that Lloyds TSB would have been required by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to take additional capital from the government if it had not taken over HBOS.[32] After the recapitalisations and Lloyds' acquisition of HBOS, the UK Government held a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group.[33]
February to June 2009[edit]
In February 2009, after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated, the FSA was instructed to "stress test" the banks against a severe economic downturn. The FSA stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen, but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario. These assumptions included:

A peak-to-trough fall in UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of over 6%, with no growth until 2011 and returning to trend-rate growth in 2012;
A rise in UK unemployment to just over 12%;
A 50% peak-to-trough fall in UK house prices;
A 60% peak-to-trough fall in UK commercial property prices.[34]

The conclusion from this exercise was that Lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred. Because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time, in March 2009 Lloyds made a deal with the UK government consisting of two elements:

Redemption of Preference Shares. The £4 billion of preference (non-voting) shares held by UKFI were repaid on 8 June 2009 following the issue of new ordinary shares—this avoided the payment of £480 million annual interest to the Treasury and allowed Lloyds to resume payment of dividends when profits allowed. These new ordinary shares were initially available to existing shareholders through an Open Offer at 38.43 pence that closed on 5 June 2009—87% were taken up. The remaining 13% were placed in the market on 8 June 2009 at 60 pence. This Open Offer and Placing was underwritten by the Treasury; if none of these new ordinary shares had been bought by existing shareholders or the open market, the government—as underwriters of the deal—would have bought them and their shareholding would have increased to a maximum of 65%. This did not happen; the government's holding remained at 43.4% and Lloyds became the first European bank to repay government "credit crunch" investment.[35] Following the government's 43.4% participation in June's Open Offer, the average buying price of the government's total shareholding was 122.6 pence.[36]
Asset Protection Scheme. Lloyds agreed in principle to enter the government's Asset Protection Scheme to insure it against potential future losses on previous loans—primarily on the old HBOS portfolio. The fee for this would have been paid for by the issue to the government of new 'B' (non-voting) shares, which could have increased the government holding to a maximum of c.62%—or higher if the government had bought all the ordinary shares issued to redeem the preference shares.[37]

June 2009 to present[edit]

Lloyds impairments peaked in the first half of 2009; by mid-2009 the Asset Protection Scheme increasingly looked like a poor deal for Lloyds. Following negotiations, the government confirmed on 3 November 2009 that Lloyds would not enter the scheme—although RBS still would. Instead, Lloyds launched a rights issue to raise capital from existing shareholders; as an existing 43.4% shareholder the government chose to take part in this and thus maintained its shareholding at 43.4%.[40][41] Following this, the National Audit Office calculated the government's average buying price for its entire stake in Lloyds to be about 74 pence.[42]
It was announced in the Government's Pre-Budget Report on 9 December 2009 that the forecast for the total loss to taxpayers for all the bank bailouts had been reduced from £50 billion to £10 billion—in part because of the restructuring of the Government's Asset Protection Scheme.[43] The final part of the December 2009 capital raise involved issuing new shares to debt holders in February 2010. This diluted existing shareholders—including the UK Government, whose shareholding was reduced from 43.4% to around 41%.[44] According to the Accord trade union general secretary Ged Nichols, Lloyds Banking Group had cut 30,000 jobs between February 2009 and August 2011; and in August 2011 it announced another 1,300 job losses.[45] The group sold its 70% stake in insurance company Esure to Esure Group Holdings on 11 February 2010. The share was valued at around £185 million.[46]
On 4 November 2012, it was reported that Lloyds was considering selling its 60% stake in St James's Place Wealth Management to raise around £1 billion.[47] In April 2013, Lloyds sold its loss-making Spanish retail operation—originally Banco Halifax Hispania—and the local investment management business in Spain to Banco de Sabadell. Lloyds will receive a 1.8% stake in Sabadell worth about €84 million and an additional sum of up to €20 million over the next five years.[48] In September 2013, it was reported that the UK government was planning to sell up to a quarter of its shares in Lloyds Banking Group.[49] The government sold 6% of its shares on 17 September 2013 at 75p, raising £3.2 billion and reducing its stake to 32.7%.[50] The UK government then sold a further 7.8% on 26 March 2014 at 75.5p raising a further £4.2bn and reducing its stake to 24.9%.[51] A trading plan of incremental sales during 2015 reduced the publicly owned stake to below 10% by the end of October.[52] Sales resumed in November 2016, as the holding was reduced to 7.99%.[53] On 17 March 2017, the British Government confirmed its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group had been sold.[54]
Divestment[edit]
Main article: TSB Bank (United Kingdom)

The UK Government's purchase of a 43.4% stake in the group in 2009 was considered as state aid; under European Commission competition laws, the group would be required to sell a portion of its business.[56] The group's divestment plan—codenamed "Verde"—identified 632 branches which would be transferred to a new business. Customers with accounts held by the branches, and staff employed within them, would be transferred. The new business would be formed from some Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales, all branches of Lloyds TSB Scotland plc and Cheltenham & Gloucester plc; these would operate under the TSB brand as TSB Bank plc.[57] The remainder of the Lloyds TSB business would be rebranded as Lloyds Bank.[58]
Lloyds Banking Group reached a Heads of Terms agreement in July 2012 to sell the Verde branches to The Co-operative Bank for £750 million.[59][60] The final transfer of TSB Bank plc to the new owner was due to be completed by late 2013. In February 2013, it was reported that Lloyds Banking Group were considering a stock market flotation of the TSB business as an alternative, should the transfer not be completed.[61] On 24 April 2013, The Co-operative Bank decided not to proceed with the acquisition because of the economic downturn and the tough regulatory environment imposed on banks. Lloyds Banking Group said that the rebranding to TSB Bank would still take place and that the new bank will be divested through an initial public offering in 2014.[62] TSB Bank began operations on 9 September 2013, under CEO Paul Pester.[63]
Lloyds Banking Group announced that 25% of TSB's shares would be floated on 24 June 2014;[64] however, with the offer being 10 times oversubscribed, 35% of TSB's shares were sold at 260p on 20 June.[65] Banco Sabadell agreed to purchase TSB in March 2015, and completed the acquisition on 8 July 2015. The purchase meant Lloyds sold its final holding in TSB.[66][67]

Controversies[edit]

Money laundering[edit]
A 2010 report by the Wall Street Journal described how Credit Suisse, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, and other banks were involved in helping the Alavi Foundation, Bank Melli, the Government of Iran, and others circumvent US laws banning financial transactions with certain states. They did this by stripping information out of wire transfers, thereby concealing the source of funds. Lloyds Banking Group settled with the US government for US$350 million. The US government's Manhattan District Attorney's Office was involved, although the case was merged with one at the federal US Department of Justice. [85]
Tax avoidance[edit]
In 2009, a case was brought against Lloyds by HM Revenue and Customs on grounds of tax avoidance. Lloyds was accused of pouring hundreds of millions of pounds into transatlantic tax avoidance schemes in the form of loans to American financial institutions.[86]
Complaints via the Financial Ombudsman Service[edit]
Lloyds TSB received 9,952 complaints via the Financial Ombudsman Service in the last half of 2009. This, when added to the other brands of the Lloyds Banking Group, was twice the number of complaints received by Barclays—the next-most-complained-about UK bank. The Financial Ombudsman Service upheld fewer complaints against Lloyds TSB than it did against Barclays.[87]
Sharia account[edit]
Lloyds TSB became the first mainstream UK bank to launch a sharia-compliant business account. The Islamic Business and Corporate account was to be run in line with sharia principles,[88] which has resulted in some controversy.[89]
HBOS fraud[edit]
Lloyds Banking Group has been criticised for failing to compensate, or even apologise to, victims of fraud perpetrated by employees of HBOS.[90][91]

Lloyds Banking Group plc is a major British financial institution formed through the acquisition of HBOS by Lloyds TSB in 2009. The Group's history stems from the founding in 1695 by the Parliament of Scotland of the Bank of Scotland, which is the second oldest bank in the United Kingdom. The Group's headquarters is located at 25 Gresham Street in the City of London and its registered office is on The Mound in Edinburgh. Lloyds Banking Group's activities are organised into: Retail Banking (including Mortgages and Sole Traders); Commercial; Life, Pensions & Insurance; and Wealth & International. Lloyds' has extensive overseas operations in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Following the takeover, the Group stopped using the name HBOS publicly. The Halifax brand, products and pricing were discontinued in Scotland until reestablished in 2013. The Halifax and Lloyds Bank brands are used in England and Wales and the Bank of Scotland brand is used in Scotland, each offering different products and pricing. Lloyds Banking Group's CEO António Horta-Osório told The Banker, "We will keep the different brands because the customers are very different in terms of attitude".[3]
Lloyds Banking Group is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It had a market capitalisation of approximately GB£57.7billion as of 4 March 2014—the 7th-largest of any LSE company.[4] It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, where it has a market capitalisation value of US$34.45 billion.[5]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
For more details on this topic, see Lloyds Bank and HBOS.
Lloyds Bank was one of the oldest banks in the UK, tracing its establishment to Taylors and Lloyds founded in 1765 in Birmingham by button maker John Taylor and iron producer and dealer Sampson Lloyd II.[6] Through a series of mergers, Lloyds became one of the Big Four banks in the UK.[7]
Bank of Scotland, which originated in the 17th century, is the second-oldest surviving UK bank after the Bank of England. In 2001, a wave of consolidations in the UK banking market led the former Halifax Building Society—which originated in 1853—to agree to a £10.8 billion merger with Bank of Scotland.[8]
Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) can trace its roots back to the first savings bank founded by Henry Duncan in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire in 1810. TSB itself was created in 1985 by an Act of Parliament that merged all the remaining savings banks in England & Wales as TSB Bank plc and in Scotland (except Airdrie Savings Bank) as TSB Scotland plc.[9]
Lloyds/TSB merger[edit]

In 1995, Lloyds Bank merged with TSB, forming Lloyds TSB Group plc.[10]
In 2000, the group acquired Scottish Widows, a mutual life-assurance company based in Edinburgh, in a deal worth £7 billion.[11] This made the group the second-largest UK provider of life assurance and pensions after Prudential. In September the same year, Lloyds TSB purchased Chartered Trust from Standard Chartered Bank for £627 million to form Lloyds TSB Asset Finance Division, which provides motor, retail and personal finance in the United Kingdom under the trading name Black Horse.[12]
Lloyds TSB continued to take part in the consolidation, making a takeover bid for Abbey National in 2001, which was later rejected by the Competition Commission.[13] In October 2003, Lloyds TSB Group agreed on the sale of its subsidiary NBNZ Holdings Limited—comprising the Group's New Zealand banking and insurance operations—to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.[14] In July 2004, Lloyds TSB Group announced the sale of its business in Argentina to Banco Patagonia Sudameris S.A.[15] and its business in Colombia to Primer Banco del Istmo, S.A..[16]
On 20 December 2005, Lloyds TSB announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its credit card business Goldfish to Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited for £175 million.[17] In 2007, Lloyds TSB announced that it had sold its Abbey Life insurance division to Deutsche Bank for £977 million.[18]
Acquisition of HBOS[edit]

On 17 September 2008, the BBC reported that HBOS was in takeover talks with Lloyds TSB, in response to a precipitous drop in HBOS's share price.[19] The talks concluded successfully that evening with a proposal to create a banking giant which would hold a third of UK mortgages.[20] An announcement was made on 18 September 2008.[21][22]
On 19 November 2008, the new acquisition and government preference share purchase was agreed by Lloyds TSB shareholders.[23] HBOS shareholders overwhelming approved the deal on 12 December.[24] Lloyds TSB Group changed its name to Lloyds Banking Group upon completion of the takeover on 19 January 2009.[25]
On 12 February 2009, Eric Daniels, the CEO of the Group, was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons. One of the key issues concerned Lloyds' takeover of HBOS and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition. Daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company, but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition. Losses were slightly more than the £10 billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to write-offs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it. The then-Chairman of Lloyds, Sir Victor Blank, said in August 2009 that losses had been "at the worst end of expectations", and that the Lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losses—which were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late 2008 and early 2009—happened.[26] This position was confirmed by Archie Kane, a senior Lloyds executive in Scotland, in evidence to the Scottish parliament's economy committee in December 2009.[27]
On 13 February 2009, Lloyds Banking Group said that the losses at HBOS were greater than had been anticipated, at around £10 billion. The share price of Lloyds Banking Group fell 32% on the London Stock Exchange, carrying other bank shares with it.[28]

On 13 October 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a government plan for the Treasury to invest £37 billion (US$64 billion, €47 billion) of new capital into major UK banks—including Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Lloyds TSB and HBOS—to avert a collapse of the financial sector.[29][30] Barclays avoided taking a capital investment from the UK Government by raising capital privately and HSBC moved capital to its UK business from its other businesses overseas.[31]
It was later confirmed that Lloyds TSB would have been required by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to take additional capital from the government if it had not taken over HBOS.[32] After the recapitalisations and Lloyds' acquisition of HBOS, the UK Government held a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group.[33]
February to June 2009[edit]
In February 2009, after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated, the FSA was instructed to "stress test" the banks against a severe economic downturn. The FSA stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen, but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario. These assumptions included:

A peak-to-trough fall in UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of over 6%, with no growth until 2011 and returning to trend-rate growth in 2012;
A rise in UK unemployment to just over 12%;
A 50% peak-to-trough fall in UK house prices;
A 60% peak-to-trough fall in UK commercial property prices.[34]

The conclusion from this exercise was that Lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred. Because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time, in March 2009 Lloyds made a deal with the UK government consisting of two elements:

Redemption of Preference Shares. The £4 billion of preference (non-voting) shares held by UKFI were repaid on 8 June 2009 following the issue of new ordinary shares—this avoided the payment of £480 million annual interest to the Treasury and allowed Lloyds to resume payment of dividends when profits allowed. These new ordinary shares were initially available to existing shareholders through an Open Offer at 38.43 pence that closed on 5 June 2009—87% were taken up. The remaining 13% were placed in the market on 8 June 2009 at 60 pence. This Open Offer and Placing was underwritten by the Treasury; if none of these new ordinary shares had been bought by existing shareholders or the open market, the government—as underwriters of the deal—would have bought them and their shareholding would have increased to a maximum of 65%. This did not happen; the government's holding remained at 43.4% and Lloyds became the first European bank to repay government "credit crunch" investment.[35] Following the government's 43.4% participation in June's Open Offer, the average buying price of the government's total shareholding was 122.6 pence.[36]
Asset Protection Scheme. Lloyds agreed in principle to enter the government's Asset Protection Scheme to insure it against potential future losses on previous loans—primarily on the old HBOS portfolio. The fee for this would have been paid for by the issue to the government of new 'B' (non-voting) shares, which could have increased the government holding to a maximum of c.62%—or higher if the government had bought all the ordinary shares issued to redeem the preference shares.[37]

June 2009 to present[edit]

Lloyds impairments peaked in the first half of 2009; by mid-2009 the Asset Protection Scheme increasingly looked like a poor deal for Lloyds. Following negotiations, the government confirmed on 3 November 2009 that Lloyds would not enter the scheme—although RBS still would. Instead, Lloyds launched a rights issue to raise capital from existing shareholders; as an existing 43.4% shareholder the government chose to take part in this and thus maintained its shareholding at 43.4%.[40][41] Following this, the National Audit Office calculated the government's average buying price for its entire stake in Lloyds to be about 74 pence.[42]
It was announced in the Government's Pre-Budget Report on 9 December 2009 that the forecast for the total loss to taxpayers for all the bank bailouts had been reduced from £50 billion to £10 billion—in part because of the restructuring of the Government's Asset Protection Scheme.[43] The final part of the December 2009 capital raise involved issuing new shares to debt holders in February 2010. This diluted existing shareholders—including the UK Government, whose shareholding was reduced from 43.4% to around 41%.[44] According to the Accord trade union general secretary Ged Nichols, Lloyds Banking Group had cut 30,000 jobs between February 2009 and August 2011; and in August 2011 it announced another 1,300 job losses.[45] The group sold its 70% stake in insurance company Esure to Esure Group Holdings on 11 February 2010. The share was valued at around £185 million.[46]
On 4 November 2012, it was reported that Lloyds was considering selling its 60% stake in St James's Place Wealth Management to raise around £1 billion.[47] In April 2013, Lloyds sold its loss-making Spanish retail operation—originally Banco Halifax Hispania—and the local investment management business in Spain to Banco de Sabadell. Lloyds will receive a 1.8% stake in Sabadell worth about €84 million and an additional sum of up to €20 million over the next five years.[48] In September 2013, it was reported that the UK government was planning to sell up to a quarter of its shares in Lloyds Banking Group.[49] The government sold 6% of its shares on 17 September 2013 at 75p, raising £3.2 billion and reducing its stake to 32.7%.[50] The UK government then sold a further 7.8% on 26 March 2014 at 75.5p raising a further £4.2bn and reducing its stake to 24.9%.[51] A trading plan of incremental sales during 2015 reduced the publicly owned stake to below 10% by the end of October.[52] Sales resumed in November 2016, as the holding was reduced to 7.99%.[53] On 17 March 2017, the British Government confirmed its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group had been sold.[54]
Divestment[edit]
Main article: TSB Bank (United Kingdom)

The UK Government's purchase of a 43.4% stake in the group in 2009 was considered as state aid; under European Commission competition laws, the group would be required to sell a portion of its business.[56] The group's divestment plan—codenamed "Verde"—identified 632 branches which would be transferred to a new business. Customers with accounts held by the branches, and staff employed within them, would be transferred. The new business would be formed from some Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales, all branches of Lloyds TSB Scotland plc and Cheltenham & Gloucester plc; these would operate under the TSB brand as TSB Bank plc.[57] The remainder of the Lloyds TSB business would be rebranded as Lloyds Bank.[58]
Lloyds Banking Group reached a Heads of Terms agreement in July 2012 to sell the Verde branches to The Co-operative Bank for £750 million.[59][60] The final transfer of TSB Bank plc to the new owner was due to be completed by late 2013. In February 2013, it was reported that Lloyds Banking Group were considering a stock market flotation of the TSB business as an alternative, should the transfer not be completed.[61] On 24 April 2013, The Co-operative Bank decided not to proceed with the acquisition because of the economic downturn and the tough regulatory environment imposed on banks. Lloyds Banking Group said that the rebranding to TSB Bank would still take place and that the new bank will be divested through an initial public offering in 2014.[62] TSB Bank began operations on 9 September 2013, under CEO Paul Pester.[63]
Lloyds Banking Group announced that 25% of TSB's shares would be floated on 24 June 2014;[64] however, with the offer being 10 times oversubscribed, 35% of TSB's shares were sold at 260p on 20 June.[65] Banco Sabadell agreed to purchase TSB in March 2015, and completed the acquisition on 8 July 2015. The purchase meant Lloyds sold its final holding in TSB.[66][67]

Controversies[edit]




The Halifax branch of Lloyds Bank on George Square, built 1897.[84]


Money laundering[edit]
A 2010 report by the Wall Street Journal described how Credit Suisse, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, and other banks were involved in helping the Alavi Foundation, Bank Melli, the Government of Iran, and others circumvent US laws banning financial transactions with certain states. They did this by stripping information out of wire transfers, thereby concealing the source of funds. Lloyds Banking Group settled with the US government for US$350 million. The US government's Manhattan District Attorney's Office was involved, although the case was merged with one at the federal US Department of Justice. [85]
Tax avoidance[edit]
In 2009, a case was brought against Lloyds by HM Revenue and Customs on grounds of tax avoidance. Lloyds was accused of pouring hundreds of millions of pounds into transatlantic tax avoidance schemes in the form of loans to American financial institutions.[86]
Complaints via the Financial Ombudsman Service[edit]
Lloyds TSB received 9,952 complaints via the Financial Ombudsman Service in the last half of 2009. This, when added to the other brands of the Lloyds Banking Group, was twice the number of complaints received by Barclays—the next-most-complained-about UK bank. The Financial Ombudsman Service upheld fewer complaints against Lloyds TSB than it did against Barclays.[87]
Sharia account[edit]
Lloyds TSB became the first mainstream UK bank to launch a sharia-compliant business account. The Islamic Business and Corporate account was to be run in line with sharia principles,[88] which has resulted in some controversy.[89]
HBOS fraud[edit]
Lloyds Banking Group has been criticised for failing to compensate, or even apologise to, victims of fraud perpetrated by employees of HBOS.[90][91]

Lloyds Banking Group Plc Mis-sold Structured Products
CompareStructuredProducts.com - 24/05/2017
Earlier this month Lloyds Banking Group Plc announced it was preparing to compensate customers holding structured products with Lloyds itself and its investment arm Scottish Widows, after a case of mis-selling came to light. According to various reports, over 7000 consumers were affected, with the bank facing a payout of over £80m. The case highlighted the Acorn Market Linked Deposit Fund and the Protected Capital Solutions Fund which we understand were sold in branch between 2008 and 2010, by staff who were subject to reduced income if they did not sell to meet targets.  These investments ultimately turned out to be somewhat more convoluted and less attractive than investors were led to believe.
Regulators agreed the bank "was in breach of the principle of providing fair, clear and not misleading promotions, because it provided the consumer with a misleading impression of the likely return."
Over the years, we’ve seen some poor value and complicated structured products. We’ve publicly warned about some of these and written privately to the Regulator about others because we’re passionate about structured products and hate to see cases like this, potentially damage the reputation of the sector.  
The Regulatory action will serve to improve the situation for those effected, as well as reduce the potential for a re-occurrence and these are obviously good outcomes.  But if the headlines serve to deter investors away from sound, well-constructed, fairly charged structured investments, then the wider consumer outcomes are not all positive. 
Whilst past performance is not a guarantee of the future, the average return from all of the structured products in our database that matured last year was 5.48% per annum, over an average term of approximately four years, four months.  Whilst still being respectable, the returns were lower than in recent years.  Our ‘Preferred’ products fared somewhat better. Many of us who utilise these investments in our portfolios are at a loss to understand why others don’t.  Far too often it transpires that it is headlines like those that the Lloyds story commanded serving as a deterrent because the investor fears they must be missing something.
An important point to appreciate from this story is that Lloyds failed to comply with the requirement that its promotions were “clear, fair and not-misleading”.  From this, you can be sure that no provider will risk such a breach and more importantly that you, as a consumer have a right to expect any structured, or other investment promotion, or literature, to be clear fair and not misleading.  They will do exactly what they say on the tin and those outcomes should not be convoluted. 
All in all, we consider this disappointing turn of events part of the evolution of the sector but if it reiterates one very crucial thing, it is a reminder of the importance of utilising an Independent Financial Adviser (IFA), who will research the whole of the market to find a product most suitable for you. Contrary to this, a non-independent, like Lloyds, Barclays or St James’ will only promote their own products, in which they have a vested interest.
We at Lowes Financial Management have been successfully advising clients since 1971. As Independent Financial Advisers, we look across the whole investment space into alternatives, alongside traditional investments, with the aim of delivering attractive returns for clients whilst taking an appropriate level of risk.
Whilst we aim to publish details of all of the structured products available through IFAs on CompareStructuredProducts.com and facilitate self-directed investment for most, we would of course welcome the opportunity to discuss your investment needs and objectives and provide appropriate advice covering this and the wider investment universe, so please don’t hesitate to call us on 0191 2818811 for an initial chat.
