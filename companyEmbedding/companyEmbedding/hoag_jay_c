Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    11:00 AM ET 07/23/2017
                                                


Christopher Nolan-helmed' Dunkirk,' filmed using 65 mm Imax cameras, is meant to feel like virtual reality minus the headset.

                                                    African Markets - Factors to watch on July 21

The following company announcements, scheduled economic indicators, debt and currency market moves and political events may affect African markets on Friday.

















                                                    Netflix needs to address new accounting standards if it continues licensing content

New standards focus mainly on revenue from contracts with customers. If Netflix Inc. (NFLX) continues to explore the lucrative opportunities offered by its original content, the company is going to have to make changes to how it identifies and records revenue. That's because of a new rule issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 2014, that changes standards for how companies recognize revenue.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

                The Top 3 Netflix Shareholders (NFLX)            


    By Jea Yu | Updated July 18, 2017 — 9:11 AM EDT    






Share





















































Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) is the world's largest online video streaming service and domestic DVD-by-mail delivery service. The company has evolved into an internet television network creating its own brand of movies, series and documentaries. It has approximately 104 million monthly subscribers throughout 190 countries. Netflix reported 2016 revenues of $8.8 billion, up 30.25% year over year (YOY). On July 18, 2017, shares of NFLX were up almost 27% year to date (YTD) — much due to a surprising growth in subscribers in the second quarter. The following are the top three shareholders of Netflix.
Reed Hasting
The CEO and founder of Netflix, Reed Hastings, owned 11.8 million shares, as of July 18, 2017. Hastings founded Pure Software in 1991 and sold his company to Rational Software in 1997 for $700 million. Hastings teamed up with Marc Randolph to form Netflix in August 1997. Hasting financed the startup with $2.5 million in seed money as a service to rent and sell DVDs over the internet. With 30 employees and a catalog of 925 rental titles, Netflix officially kicked off its online service in August 1998. The company introduced its subscription-based DVD-by-mail rental plan in 1999. It went public in February 2002, and co-founder Marc Randolph cashed out and left the company to pursue other ventures. In 2007, Netflix reached the 1 million subscriber mark and recorded its first profitable quarter.
Hastings envisioned the future in on-demand video streaming as it cut out expenses such as postage, packaging and warehouse storage for physical DVDs. As a result, Netflix launched an internet video streaming service option at no extra cost — which is what most people use today rather than the DVD rental service.
Jay C. Hoag
Jay C. Hoag owned 6.4 million shares, as of July 18, 2017. Hoag is the general partner at Team Crossover Ventures (TCV), a venture capital and management firm for technology companies. TCV has raised $7.7 billion and led investments in Facebook Inc, Groupon Inc. (NASDAQ: GRPN) and Netflix. Hoag serves on the board of directors of Netflix as well as Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA), Zillow Group Inc. (NASDAQ: Z) and TechTarget Inc. (NASDAQ: TTGT). Hoag's firm shrewdly purchased an additional $200 million of Netflix convertible debt in 2011 during the Quikster debacle when shares plummeted. 
Neil D. Hunt
Neil D. Hunt is the chief product officer (CPO) at Netflix. Hunt owned 1.4 million shares as of July 18, 2017. He has been with Netflix since 1999. Hunt leads the product development team that designs and optimizes the Netflix service experience. He receives various performance-driven stock and option grants in addition to his salary of $1 million and a bonus of $5.25 million (2016). Prior to Netflix, Hunt had product development roles at Pure Atria, Rational Software and Pure Software. He is also a nonexecutive board member of Logitech Inc. (NASDAQ: LOGI).
