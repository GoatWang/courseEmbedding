Help address your complexion concerns with Peter Thomas Roth skin care products at QVC. Having struggled with his own skin challenges, Peter Thomas Roth knew how difficult it was to find effective treatments and developed an uncanny knack for sensing what kind of products consumers wanted. He used his experience as inspiration for his skin care brand, which he launched in 1993. Since then, Peter Thomas Roth has cemented a worldwide reputation as an innovator. All of his products, from moisturizers to acne treatments, reflect this philosophy: breakthrough formulas yield astonishing results. Because they fulfill that promise, Peter Thomas Roth has developed a cult following of beauty insiders, celebrities, and everyday consumers.

Peter Thomas Roth travels the globe in search of the best ingredients to deliver state-of-the-art quality. He uses them to create multiple lines of skin care products that serve different purposes. His Un-Wrinkle line helps address the appearance of wrinkles and expression lines. His Acne and Oil-Free collections are ideal for oily and acne-prone skin. His Neuroliquid formulas help improve the look of wrinkles for a younger-looking complexion. His FIRMx assortment helps skin look firmer, more youthful, and radiant. He also offers products for preventative care, like products with protection.

Peter Thomas Roth's customers most often tell him they like his line because, put simply, "It works!" But don't take their word for it—try his breakthrough formulas formulated with leading-edge ingredients for yourself! The results will simply astonish you.

Attention: Professional Coaches, Consultant, Speakers, Trainers and Small-Business Owners. 

Saturday July 29
Dear Fellow Helping Professional

Over the last 20 years helping coaches consultants speakers and trainers to increase their credibility, reach and profits they've told me that the 3 key challenges before our interaction were:

 Lack of clients - especially qualified clients
 Lack of money - sustainable regular income
Lack of time - to spend with family and serious enjoyment!


If you've suffered with these…

Then the products and services on this website could be just what you've been searching for.
Let's start:

By me giving you valuable information free of charge. Simply pop your details in the boxes at the top right-hand side and I'll give you immediate access to your free report: "The 7 Time Management Problems - How to Avoid Them and Squeeze More Out Of Every Single Day!"
If your focus is to…

Share more of your authentic message with more people than you could ever hope to reach on a one-to-one basis and - be rightfully and justly rewarded for the positive difference you make - then you're in the right place.

I look forward to our conversations and interactions over the years to come

Every success

Welcome to Peter Thompson's home
page.​


I am a game producer and
designer from Orlando, Florida. I currently
develop educational flight simulation 
software used in middle schools
and high schools across the country.


I have been actively
producing, designing, and developing games and
mods since 2006, and a large portion of 
my design skillset is
self-taught. I also have an M.S. in Game Design from Full Sail.


It is my hope that you
get the opportunity to know me a little better
through my work, so take some time and 
browse around! Thanks for
stopping by.

Through careful and detailed investigation of these claims, Peter Thompson & Associates has successfully represented many Mainers who were injured by products and medications that had not been properly tested or had problems that were ignored by the manufacturer. In determining whether a product is defective, a manufacturer is required to take into account expected human error and act reasonably to prevent avoidable injury when that type of human error occurs. Often a part that costs no more than a few cents can save a person’s life or prevent serious injury. At Peter Thompson & Associates, we are proud of our effort and the efforts of other attorneys who handle these types of cases to hold manufacturers accountable for their negligence in design or in resolving known problems with defective products and medications.Our firm uses the very best experts to assess whether a product or medication is defective. Through the use of expert analysis and through examination of a company’s internal records, we have an excellent track record of success in defective product and medication cases. In a recent case, we were able to show that a manufacturer knew about a flaw in the design of a saw guard and had been told by its own engineers to correct the flaw. Despite having been advised of the safety hazard, the manufacturer nevertheless chose to keep manufacturing and distributing the saw with the defect.Our firm also uses the best experts in the field to determine the nature and extent of our clients’ injuries. Treating physicians are generally willing to provide some information about our client’s future restrictions and the future impact of his/her injuries. However, because treating doctors often do not have the time or inclination to provide a thorough analysis of the future impact of injuries on work activities and other activities of daily living, we use the best experts in the field to provide more comprehensive analysis of these issues in order to prove our cases. We find that, by providing this type of detailed and comprehensive analysis to insurance companies, we are able to settle cases favorably without having to go to court over 98 percent of the time. Insurance companies know Attorney Thompson’s reputation in court and, in the vast majority of cases, choose to settle rather than risking an unfavorable result at trial and having to pay the high the costs associated with trial.

Submit      Maine Personal Injury Lawyers  Maine Personal Injury Lawyers Who Get Results  If you've been seriously injured in an accident or due to medical malpractice, finding the right Maine personal injury lawyer to take on the insurance company and protect your rights and interests can seem overwhelming. With all those TV lawyers out there acting tough, it's hard to know what to believe and who you can trust.   All top-rated guidebooks on how to choose the best personal injury lawyer focus on four important factors you should consider: (1) the lawyer's experience handling personal injury cases and taking cases to trial; (2) the results that the lawyer has obtained for his clients; (3) the lawyer's reputation for trustworthiness and honesty; and (4) overall client satisfaction.  Experience and Results  Our reputation was built on two decades of obtaining excellent results for our clients and treating our clients with respect. Attorney Thompson's legal team consists of award-winning attorneys with over 60 years combined experience in personal injury law, as well as expert case managers, paralegals, private investigators, and board-certified physician consultants. Unlike most other firms, we work as a team, bringing together our experience and expertise, and thereby achieving the best possible results for our clients.   And we've proven that this approach works. We have a 98% success rate, several nationally-reported victories and precedent-setting court decisions, as well as over 100 successful jury trials. In 2016 alone, we recovered over $15,000,000 for our clients and were voted, for the 9th year running, "Best Personal Injury Lawyer" in both Portland and Bangor. Our track record and experience earned our firm the U.S. News & World Report “Best Law Firms” and “Best Lawyers in America” ratings.  Trust and Client Satisfaction  Individuals and families who have been seriously injured in accidents trust us to handle their cases not only because of our reputation for obtaining excellent results, but also for giving our clients the compassion, respect, and attention they deserve. Our clients have rated our firm 4.9 out of 5 stars for "Quality of Service," "Communication Ability," and "Responsiveness," with 100% stating that they “would recommend” our firm to others. (Click here to see our Client Survey responses.) “To be a good lawyer, you must do more that just fight aggressively for your clients and achieve excellent results; you must also consistently address your clients' needs and concerns in a timely manner and develop relationships based on trust and respect,” Peter Thompson says simply. Our firm and its reputation have been built around this philosophy. At Peter Thompson & Associates, every client matters to us.  Making Our Communities Safer  While Peter Thompson & Associates’ recoveries for our clients have been substantial—and have been for over 20 years—we understand that our clients rarely pursue a case solely for monetary gain. We are fully aware that, for many of our clients, holding negligent and careless people and doctors accountable for harm they have done is just as important as getting the compensation they need and deserve. Peter Thompson and his legal team are committed to fighting for accountability and justice. “We are in this fight to make our communities and hospitals safer places for our families and children.”  We’re Here to Help  We also understand the stress that is caused by serious injuries and, for that reason, do everything possible to minimize that stress. We know that being injured in an accident can cause serious financial difficulties and, therefore, assist our clients in accessing disability and health insurance benefits and medical payments coverage, among other things.  We Believe in Giving Back  Peter Thompson & Associates has been a strong supporter of non-profits such as the Brain Injury Association of Maine, the Disability Rights Maine, and Consumers for Affordable Healthcare. Our attorneys and staff have also invested thousands of hours supporting our communities by volunteering, providing pro bono legal services, serving on non-profit and municipal boards, and coaching kids’ sports teams.  Our Maine Personal Injury Lawyers Represent Accident Victims Statewide.  Attorney Thompson and his legal team have successfully represented injured Mainers from almost every town and city throughout the State. Our main offices are in Portland, Bangor, Falmouth, and Camden, but we also have office meeting locations in Kittery, Wells, Sanford, Kennebunk, Biddeford, Old Orchard Beach, South Portland, Portland, Westbrook, Gorham, Falmouth, Yarmouth, Freeport, Brunswick, Bath, Lewiston, Auburn, Gardiner, Augusta, Waterville, Skowhegan, Camden, Rockland, Belfast, Newport, Bangor, Ellsworth, Bar Harbor, Machias, Calais, Houlton, and Presque Isle. If you don’t live near one of our offices, we’ll come to you. We routinely do home and hospital visits. We strive to make the entire process as easy as possible for you. Almost all of the information we need to put your case together can be obtained over the phone, by mail, or email.  Injured while visiting Maine but live out of State?  Peter Thompson & Associates also represents many people who live out-of-state who were injured during a trip to Maine. In the vast majority of cases, we can successfully settle cases for our out-of-state clients without requiring them to return to Maine.  If you don’t collect money, you don’t have to pay for our services.  Because the vast majority of our clients cannot afford to hire an attorney, we represent accident and medical malpractice victims on a contingent fee basis, which means we are paid a percentage of what you recover.

                                        Having joined Peter Thomson's Mentoring Group I immediately felt my business going in directions I'd never thought was possible. The support has been so valuable especially when there's only me, my last call with Steve Harrison.
                                        Well, has just taken my breath away. 
                                        He took my thinking about myself to a completely new level in 5 seconds flat. He's my mentor, support and 'machete between the eyes man.' If you really want to think differently, shift gear and go places, then stop pecking around with the turkeys and fly with the eagles. I am and I urge you to do the same.

                                        THIS STUFF WORKS... I ran my big webinar yesterday. The sales pitch has never been my strong point, but I applied everything I've learned from Peter Thomson and Steve Harrison and I made 23 sales yesterday. That's 23 sales for a downloadable set of products and earned £6,785. The whole thing is recorded and being repeated next week through Evergreen so it will be interesting to see how many sales I can make whilst I'm sitting around the pool in Spain. Happy to share exactly what I did to make nearly £7k in an hour. And thank you to Peter and Steve for all your help

On Friday 16th March I attended the monthly mentoring session, during the session Peter shared with us the power of effective Intros and Outros

                                        On Tuesday 23rd March I spoke at a recruitment summit as a favour for a friend, using the Intro and Outro techniques shared by Peter 52 potential clients booked appointments into my calendar for 1-2-1 sessions. If only 10% of those convert into clients that will be worth a minum of 30k in the next 5 months
                                        
                                        Thank you so much to whole of the team for sharing some great stuff-awesome..! 
                                        

Terry Edwards





I left my career in Marketing last year to pursue my passion for nutrition and start my own business. All the conditions were right but I wasn't prepared for the complete feeling of overwhelm and confusion I felt in the first few months.
                                            I thought my marketing and corporate experience would carry me through but this was very different from what I'd imagined... 
                                            
                                            Since being part of Peter's mentoring programme I've felt really supported and that I had a 'structure' to help me move forward. Having access to all this knowledge, feedback and encouragement has enabled me to achieve things much
                                            faster (and avoiding many mistakes I'm sure!) than I could possibly have done by myself. My first workshop brought in £2000, which is a very good start, and I'm already building on that, looking to systemise my process (to attract clients to
                                            my weight loss programme) by creating a webinar programme. Without Peter's help, and importantly, the wealth of tips and information I glean each month from all the fantastic people in the group, I wouldn't even have know where to 
                                            start. I really feel I have no reason not to succeed now!

Since joining the mentoring group I ran a webinar. I started promoting it less than 2 working days before. I posted an announcement on 5 of my own LinkedIn groups (I didn't post on anybody else's groups) plus one email on the Monday to members. 89 people registered. LESSON 1 - you CAN fill a webinar within 48 hours of it starting.

                                        I advertised it as a 60 minute webinar. It ended up lasting 1 hour and 44 minutes. 69 people turned up for the webinar and 66 were still there an hour later. Then within minutes it dropped to 55. LESSON 2 - if you tell people it will last a certain time and you exceed that they may plan other things in their diary and be forced to drop out. And we generated £6,800 of sales on the day.

Since joining the Mentoring Group and applying the ideas my subscribers have gone from from 7 to 136 and I anticipate similar growth next year.
                                        

Marianne Cowdrey 





We joined the mentoring course because we felt we were stuck in the same old groove and needed some new ideas to improve our business. 
                                        We were not disappointed. We now have so many ideas. The one I feel has made the most financially beneficial as yet is the re-writing of our monthly offer letters.
                                        We run weekly training course and the number of delegates attending has doubled since we changed, increasing our turnover by at least £32,000.  As our competition offer similar courses for free, we are very pleased with this increase.
                                        

Chris & Lynda Chanin





Let me give you some advice right now - right here!
                                        Don't talk to these guys if you want your life to run without frustration!  
                                        The frustration of SITTING on an extra £7500 per month without even knowing it; the frustration of getting 5 extra great ideas that will enhance my business with a minimum of work and the biggest frustration of all – being in business for all these years of struggle not knowing that the answer was staring me in the face.
                                        

Jeff Pettitt





Being 'The Export Expert' I work with multi-million international companies to help them grow their global business. Before I joined Peter's mentoring programme, I did a lot of thinking, looked at where else I could spend my money and what the outcome and profitability would be for me and my company...and I told Peter this up front.
										Taking the time for my own business, instead of always focusing on everyone else's, has given us the impetus to be bolder, plan for the future, create new revenue streams and most importantly for us, use Peter's influence to create high-level contacts to further develop our business. We are now focused on the scalability within our business and no longer Too Busy Making Money to Make Real Money (as my wife always says)
                                        

Gary Jennings





I was too bogged down in being "busy" to have made any real progress. In Month 11 I have 19 products of varying value - 9 of which are complete and out there, 4 of which are nearly done, and another 4 in creation. 
										This focus has been so useful for me personally and the benefit of the group's contribution, Peter's facilitation and Steve's "awesome" monthly calls have combined to make it the best value for money training I have ever attended.

                                        

David Hyner





Since investing in the mentoring course with Peter Thomson, I have a greater knowledge of how to run Seminars.
                                        His advice helped me run my first workshop which generated £12,000.  
                                         I am also in the process of developing more products 
                                         which will net me thousands of pounds in the future.  
                                         I would definitely recommend this training to anyone 
                                         who is serious about developing their business if they 
                                         are a speaker/author/coach. 
                                        

Bernie De Souza





I used the 'XXXXXXXX' this morning.  It really 
                                        did make a difference to how the meeting went.  
                                        AND when I indicated £XXXX as my day rate 
                                        (double what I usually say) 
                                        he simply said, "OK well I will have to find the budget won't I?"  Eureka moment.
                                        You guys rock – I really do appreciate all those little 'gems'!  It's been a long time since I felt this fired up for all sorts of reasons, and having people to kick me like I kick my clients is just what I need. 
                                        

Diane Dykes





In my first hour with  Peter and Steve they opened my eyes to multiple amazing business strategies and one of those strategies that I applied from the very next day has easily earned me around £20,000 more this year alone. 
                                        The Mentoring Group really support each other too, our recent visit to Spain opened my eyes to far greater business ideas I wouldn't have dreamed about  a year ago.
                                         Apart from having a wealth of experience and knowledge to share they really care about your results as much as you do. I've not only gained a great business mentors but a great friends too.

After my mentoring call I changed the copy to incorporate 'Your Idea' and waited with baited breath.
                                        That one single advert produced 7 full paying clients for my 3 day deal finder event at a ticket price of £3000. WOW 7 x £3,000 = £21,000
                                        I would like to thank you and Peter for your hard work and support.

Since joining the Mentoring Programme I've seen a 110% increase in fees and
										my First Book was published in December 
                                        

Peter Lewis





After 12 months of being in the Mentoring Programme, I'm now selling now in 5 Countries and next year I anticipate an increased in income of £70,000 (minimum)

                                                Most of my friends think I am crazy. How can you live and work with your husband. Well I'll let you into a secret: I wouldn't invest my life anywhere else. I get to be the guinea pig for all of the new products, the ideas and methods Peter shares. And on a personal level, employing 'family' is cheap labour - and keeps me out of the shops!


Most of my friends think I'm crazy ...... working with my husband!! 

I am just so lucky.  I get to meet so many fascinating people who are achieving some amazing stuff. This business moves on at such a pace -  The speed of new product creation methods , new technical advances in product production and new hot ways of low cost no cost marketing means that we always have to be 'at the cutting edge'
  
I currently project manage the business. Taking on new opportunities, formatting new products and investigating potential joint ventures. 
 
This is where the magic happens ...  a 'family friendly" business that is so positive, generous and market leading  -  and most of all it's great fun!!
Fun with a serious intent ......











Rachel Groves

												
Imagine having Peter as your first Boss ... a better education than most schools I believe
 
I've know Peter, Sharon, Beverley & Steve for 25 plus years now and we've worked together for a lot of that time.
 
I went to live abroad for a while and when I came back I re-joined the team.
 
I'm Peter's P.A which means I get involved in all areas of the business ... Peter creates the stuff and we make it happen.
 
If you have any questions you'd like to ask, if I don't know the answer then I'm likely to know a man who does.
 
You will always find me in the kitchen at parties ... or getting onto a plane somewhere
 
Really looking forward to meeting you at one of our live events very soon.











Beverley Parkin

		
I've worked with Peter on and off now for over 25 years now … it seems time does fly when you're having fun !
 
Working here is an inspiration, we work very closely as a team and combine our collective resources to help our clients be more successful - 'by their definition'. I am a published author of a not so well known book entitled  'wonce a ponnet time' a collection of writings from Rosie Parkin aged 9.

I also do most of the buying for the business and have fun negotiating with suppliers to build 'win-win' relationships - I also get involved in all of the finances and collect in the pennies. I especially enjoy finding great venues for our one day promotional tours around the country and our 3 day events. 
 
Working part time as I have 2 young children I get the best of both worlds .... a lively and active working life and a lively and active family life.

										







Steve Harrison

                    Sales, Sales and more Sales that's how you can sum me up.
                     
                    Working alongside Peter from the late 70's in carphone business up to the present day it's selling that's been predominant in my business career.
                     
                    Negotiating and persuading and influencing are easier with the right skills and mind set and I have honed my skills for 30 years.    
                     
                    Being a pretty good trained chef in my earlier years it's my belief a great business is like a great meal you need the right ingredients to make the magic.
                     
                    So, having consulted with over 4000 businesses over the last 10 years in pure business growth I can help, guide and encourage you to make your business what you deserve it to be, not through superfluous b.s but through straight forward straight talking and focused sessions aimed at making more money in less time and boy will we have some fun along the way.												







Martin

Being the newest member of the team I spend most of my time talking to machines so anything techie  then I'm your man.

Web design, graphic design, video editing, audio editing, the technical side of our social media campaigns - and anything relating to product creation. 

I am a self published booklet author and am currently writing my second book. It could have been daunting joining such a well established team, but they were so welcoming and now I know that they couldn't survive without me!!!


At home I enjoy nothing more than playing/teaching the trumpet, having studied at the Birmingham Conservatoire I like to keep a high level of playing, practicing 3-4 hours a day I bring my trumpet (and practice mute) into the office with me.

Clients Say






Peter Thomson is Nightingale Conant's leading UK author – we even export his programmes to the States. Our customers really love his 'down to earth and practical style' and more importantly, he is a true friend of mine.

I've watched him research, test and polish his ideas to constantly add value. It's an amazing process to see. 

I even have members of staff who say they could listen to Peter all day (and still stay awake)
 
So why would I be telling you this?
 
9 years ago Peter launched The Achievers Edge a monthly audio programme which shares the secrets of success.
 
It's a great programme and constantly challenges each and every listener to 'raise their game' just a little bit; but on a regular basis. The compounding effect is awesome.
 
I'd urge you to try The Achievers Edge for a number of reasons.
 
His ideas are just so powerful, inspiring and positive
The programme is extremely cost effective
He always adds massive value
He is genuinely focused on your success
You'll love it and - what do you have to lose?

David Hughes
Managing Director Nightingale Conant UK










Peter's ***-*** idea has earned me a £million by placing my 'products' in their true market context and pricing (up) accordingly.
 
No more 'Rate per Hour'. Using the ***-*** has made life so much easier and rewarding. No more working out estimated hours and struggling with choosing an 'appropriate' rate per hour. Just think of Peter Thomson, pick a figure and treble it. Then - don't have any regrets when they accept your fee that you have under-quoted!
 
About 10 years ago, in the week following first hearing Peter Thomson speak about perceived product values and pricing (the ***-**** concept) I was asked to visit xxxxxxx (major company – name withheld by Peter Thomson)  to discuss an accounting project.
 
Travelling down by train, I perceived the job to be chargeable at £3,000, based on my previous charge-out rates. After discussing the project with the Financial Director for some 2 hours, we came to the crunchy bit. How much?
 
Even today, I have no idea why or how, but whilst my notes said "£3,000" my mouth said "£10,000". With only the merest flicker of an eyelid, the FD said "OK, when can you start?" It just proved to me how powerful Peter Thomson's message is. It even works sub-consciously!
 
Over the following 10 years, Peter Thomson's pricing techniques lifted my practise to new professional and profitable levels. His ***-**** has not only improved income, but allowed time-off to enjoy a more measured and balanced lifestyle.
 
I have no hesitation in urging anyone to go and listen to Peter Thomson. It will change their life.

I knew how to referee and I knew how to be a customer and I knew my vision of wanting to own the best refereeing kit company in the world and with that background I started a mail order referee kit business.

Now you can build a business through trial and error – not to be recommended but a great source of experience (I tried it!).  Now you can build a business using the template that your competitors are using – your business grows but you're not becoming the best kit company in the world (I tried it!).
Or you can build a business through Peter Thomson's tried and trusted Accelerated Business Growth System (I'm doing it!)
It's a no brainer.
I'm delighted to write a few words for Peter (and his team) to say "You have my 100% Risk Free Guarantee that using the Peter Thomson method of business growth you will make more money, have more enjoyment and set the standard in your industry."
Make more money – the business has grown 17.83 times since I took it over.
Have more enjoyment – I don't have customers I have friends who allow me to recommend what kit and equipment they should be wearing.

Setting the standard – boy is it a good feeling when your competitors have to wait for you to publish the road map for the coming season so they can try and keep pace.
But here's the kicker – how can they keep pace when I have Peter Thomson in my corner.  A simple e-mail to the man will normally unstick any stuckness.
The man talks simple common sense – but it's only common sense after he's revealed it to you!

Out of the 15 speakers at our event Peter was rated Number 1 – by a mile! It was no surprise to hear our delegates say how much they'd enjoyed his down-to-earth presentation, his practical ideas and his warm and friendly style.

We needed someone to inspire the 3500 attendees of our roadshows and give them some simple tools for business success. Peter's presentation was first class and a learning experience that was enjoyed by everyone who attended.

I think there are lots of ideas in Achievers Edge that help me in my life.  In addition to new thoughts however, one of the key things for me is, it is often a reminder of things I know, but that have got somehow lost, in the hurly burly of my thinking about life.

As an example, recently I was listening to the Edge and Peter talked about the need to live life to the full.  Live every week and day as if you are your last. Life has only a finite number of days. Now I know this, there is nothing new here and this idea has influenced me before, in fact this point was only 2 mins of the month's programme. 
 
But those comments and ideas from Peter influenced my life for a week after I listened to the programme.  Every day I thought about making the most of my day before that idea submerged itself back into my unconscious thoughts.  My week was a whirlwind of particularly rewarding business and personal activity.

I could give you other examples too.  So the value of Achievers Edge to me is that it goes beyond being a source of new ideas, it is also a reminder of the basic cornerstone of my self talk. The need to set goals, be positive, think the impossible, celebrate life, influence others by looking at life from their perspective etc etc.  It helps me to refocus and check I am really doing the things I believe in.

I met Peter Thomson in January 2004 when he conducted a workshop for our senior Directors. We were so impressed with his content and presentation we hired Peter to work with us on a sales and marketing strategy

After only one day he came up with an idea that we thought was electrifying

We implemented the idea in total and committed resources and expenditure to ensure it worked for us.

Since then the idea has made us over £1,2000,000 (GBP) in additional profit!!

We are still using the idea today and it is our constant lead generation strategy

Peter Thomson is undoubtedly the UK's leading sales and marketing strategist and I would recommend to anyone who want to improve their sales and marketing results to use Peter as we have done over the last 2 ½ years

I met Peter after a speaking engagement about 5 years ago.  It was so invigorating that I just had to subscribe and become a part of "The Achievers Edge" family.  5 years later I still feel that way.
 
Every month new ideas, an injection of positive thinking, and optimism grounded in usable ideas. Specifics? Peter's advice on planning over the longer term, countless tips from guest speakers, the double prioritised to-do list; they're woven in to my life these days. 

Richard McDougal





As a subscriber to Peter's audio programme 'The Achievers Edge' I have gained numerous ideas and tips on how to achieve more success both in my personal and business life.
 
His practical and thought provoking messages inspired me to start my own web site and share my own ideas and experiences with small business owners worldwide. His motivational and inspirational prompts have led me to achieve great things in my life. I unreservedly recommend you listen and take action on Peter's ideas and advice.

Robert Warlow





Peter Thomson is one of the most eloquent, persuasive and thought provoking communicators that we've had the privilege to work with at Nightingale-Conant. 
  
Not only does Peter show you new and different ways of thinking about success, but he delivers his ideas in "ready-made" practical form—making it easy for our customers to apply in their lives right away.  Our best-selling program with Peter, The Best-Kept Secrets of the World's Great Communicators, has received top "customer satisfaction" ratings from our clients. 
  
Our all-new program with Peter, The Best-Kept Secrets of the World's Great Achievers, is like a "modern day Think and Grow Rich" and has been anticipated for months.

I can totally recommend tgiMondays and membership of the Achievers Club. Since I started feeding my brain with positive messages and taking Peter's advice, (I think I started subscribing to the Achiever's Edge in 1999) I have risen from the ranks of Sales Executive right through to Managing Director and the Company has gone from £3M per annum to £25M this year (and returning a stunning bottom line).
  
It hasn't all been down to Peter's expert guidance – but he certainly has given me an Edge which has enabled us to outsmart the competition many times.
  
Thank you for everything!

Peter Ballard 





I cannot begin to fully quantify the benefits that I have accrued through working with your products. It all started eight years ago when seeing you personally deliver some of your tried and tested systems, I actually started to take action and implement a number of your ideas.

As you know I have three thriving businesses and a million pounds property in Stratford-upon-Avon. I sold a business a couple of years ago for £2,500,000. I can say without a doubt that these things would not have happened without using the PTI systems and your great ideas. Even better things are about to follow! I know that anyone who takes action can achieve so much more by following your processes.

Most pleasing is the benefit of passing the enhanced knowledge gained through the personal and business development to those close to me in life, my family, friends, clients and team members. Your enthusiasm is infectious. Thank you so very much

I have been an ' Achievers Edge' subscriber for around 4 years now and have found the material invaluable. I always find the monthly issues interesting and useful, picking out areas that are relevant to me now
 
As well as know that I am building an archive of back issues that allow me to 'dip' into them in the future.
 
I very much look forward to the guest interviews as they provide fascinating insights into how other people have made a success of themselves, and often offer more than a book or audio programme, as you are asking questions and getting responses that are relevant for your subscribers.
 
I have also benefited immensely from the audio extracts, as this section has introduced me to many audio programmes that I would never otherwise have considered buying through more traditional medium.
 
This is because, being able to listen to 20 mins or so allows you to quickly make up your mind as to whether you'd benefit from the rest of the programme. Much of my audio library has been built on hearing extracts from the 'Achievers Edge'.
 
I would highly recommend the ' Achievers Edge' for anyone who is serious about developing themselves in any area of this wonderful thing called life!

Marc Carter





The Achievers Edge has provided me with great inspiration and advice on how to grow my new business. It allows me to share in the knowledge of Peter Thomson and other leading successful business leaders who would not normally be available to me. The Achievers Edge is an excellent business tool offering great advice and fresh ideas to meet the day to day and long term challenges of running a business and ones life.

I have been a subscriber to the Achievers Edge for 7½ since you first started the series.  I remember then being attracted to the Monthly magazine on Tape because I could listen to it in the Car and was spending around 7 hours per day travelling at that time. Working in sales I soon found a number of ideas that have helped me over the years and I remember an early series on "Change" which made an impact on me. Since then I have always tried to adapt to change positively and as a result I have been promoted a number of times and currently hold a job that I have been after for some years. There have been many ideas over the years that have given me that "edge" and have helped me be "ahead of the game" if you will excuse the cliché. I have used a number of your ideas and also ideas from your guests to good effect and could probably use more. 
                        
                        One particular life changing feature early in 1997 stood out for me was about limiting our "Exposure" if I recall correctly to financial risk. I remember you making the point about being prepared for the unexpected and reducing our reliance on one critical income to pay our debts etc. Well since then and after purchasing a number of programmes from Nightingale Conant I hope to pay off my mortgage this year, eight years after I first made the decision to pay it off early. From a financial point of view I have taken your advice and that of John Commuta, Bob Procter and Robert Kiyosaki and I am sure that we will benefit from it in the future as well as my children who have watched our circumstances change. We are better organised for the constant possibility of "re-engineering". However, it is interesting that as I have increased my adaptability and flexibility and at the same time have become more prepared I am given bigger assignments and have just taken on another role which should keep my thoroughly busy for the next three years.
                        
                        Each month I look forward to your envelope arriving with my monthly dose of positive thinking and ideas.
                        
                        One thing remains important to me and that is the monthly Achievers Edge. Please keep up the good work and you may not know it but you have had a substantial impact on my career and our wealth.
                        
                        Finally, I am not sure where this thought came from that I have used successfully in Sales Training, the thought is that before we can "Earn" we must "Learn". Clearly placing the "L" in front of "Earn" demonstrates how our earning potential is limited only by our ability to learn. Education really is the Key!

Richard Vis





I always like listening to your programme. I find them interesting, informative and uplifting. A lot of what we hear from day to day in the media is bad news and doom and gloom, your programmes are a change from that.
 
I know that listening to your programmes and other various Nightingale Conant programmes is definitely life improving, if you use the ideas. In my case it is in a lot of subtle ways as apposed to specifics. For example, when dealing with people and certain situation, I can 'hear' certain people's voices and quotes from the programmes in my head. These lead me to behave and react/respond in different and better ways.

Ian Popplewell





The Achievers Edge continually provides thoughts and ideas that produce positive and effective change in my work and social life.  It is the single best source of business, psychology and self development in an easily digested format.
 
It is the first publication that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in self improvement.
 
Inspirational!

Bob Caren





Peter Thomson is a business person who enthusiastically embraces every aspect of business in which he is engaged. That enthusiasm is embodied in his skills as an accomplished author, masterful interviewer, and presenter par excellence All these attributes and more he brings to his monthly business and personal development audio programme, 'The Achiever's Edge'.
  
If you are a budding entrepreneur – grab The Achievers Edge with both hands.
  
If you are already a successful entrepreneur (and aim to stay that way) The Achievers Edge will supply great ideas to help keep you ahead of the field.
  
If you are neither of the above but perhaps a cog, large or small, on the corporate business wheel, beset by endless board and committee meetings and ponderous decision making to name but a few, then seize The Achievers Edge for the breath of fresh air that it will undoubtedly prove to be, filled with independent thinking, constructive ideas, business nous and a total absence of hierarchical presumption.
  
Worth its subscription for the monthly interview alone.

Martin Tunstall





I am writing to express how I have achieved my goals through The Achiever's Edge. I have been a subscriber for 7 years and started as a shopkeeper. I am now the Neath Town Mayor and have been since June 2004.
 
I feel that all my success has been achieved by the ideas I learned in The Achiever' Edge and I will continue to be a subscriber for the rest of my life.

G Singh
Town Mayor





The Achiever's Edge audio package is a superb programme - I have found it to be tremendously useful and very practical.  Each month it is full of great ideas that can be put to immediate use.

Kevin Whiltshire





Peter, we were in the car driving home from work and I have to tell you, the Achiever's Edge is just wonderful, it has given me so much to think about for my business and we are always eager to implement the latest ideas you come up with. Phenomenal.

Marcus de Maria





Peter's product creation workshop quite simply removes any excuses you are making to yourself for failing to make money from products. Those new to product creation need not fear - as no experience is necessary. He shares both the knowledge you need and gives you the tools to get started. More experienced marketers will not be disappointed. Just one of his tried and tested tips could save you years of experimentation and frustration, not to mention many times the ticket price. If you are serious about making money from products, you need to attend.

Pete Bennett





I was very skeptical that I was capable of making and marketing my own products. It seemed too daunting, overwhelming and mission impossible. The information, strategies, exercises and Peterisms have turned it into a "I can't wait too and don't stop me now I'm having such a good time.

Marcia Gladwin





An excellent course packed to bursting with useful strategies, hints and tips. If you're serious about making money from creating your own products then you should definitely attend this practical down-to-earth course.

Helen Leach





First hour alone was worth the course and every other hour was at least as good. Thanks a million Peter and team.

Mark Bristow





I've had a great time, learning how to take my ideas to market. The course was ver precise and informative. I feel it represents great value the money thank you.

Paul Ribbons





I now know that I can create and sell product, and make money from it.

Simon Davies





Although I do force myself to read books, for me audio learning is far the most easiest and cost effective method of taking in information, especially when driving long distance when I will take the three most recent tapes and play them with rest gaps, between sides listening to the radio. I find the variety of monthly topics interesting, applicable and very much relevant to business today; especially where nothing in what we do is entirely predicable.
 
The first program I listened too was your 4th tape many years ago. I now have a big pile of tapes and for the cost of two cups of coffee a week ("the latte factor" investment index) I get access to a lot of information, peoples experiences and the opportunity to put new ideas in to practice.
 
On reflection I have also purchased many of the audio programs and books by Achiever's Edge guests – their work I find a great resource that I use to help me, my colleagues or friends.
 
The personal touch is very important, it is comforting and many of the ideas taken from the program have worked very well for me in business, my personal life and in helping others especially young people looking at starting out in business.

Paul Unger





This programme is packed with fantastic ideas inspiring my imagination to produce more and more inspiring products.

Michael Snuggs





There was so much information, help, tips and great details which was shared. It excelled beyond my expectations. I have all the resources I need!

Vanessa Barker



                        
                        Could it be that I am the only Environmental Health Officer subscribing to "The Achiever's Edge"? If any of my colleagues around the country do also subscribe, I bet I have been receiving it for the longest time. 

I still have all the tapes neatly filed, the first being tape ten of volume one! They are not just filed and forgotten of course because I do still dip into them from time to time to jog my memory or retrieve a particular snippet. 

I first became a subscriber when I was running my own consultancy and continued even when I returned to working full time in Local Government over six years ago because I found your monthly offerings so interesting and helpful. 

Whilst my qualifications and experience cover a wide range of subjects, I have specialised in Health and Safety since 1997. Although employed as an enforcement officer, my real work has revolved around providing advice and guidance - much of it to new and fledgling businesses. Because good business practice and people's general attitude are so closely linked to good health and safety, I often find that I am including elements of your guidance in my conversations. I do not just deal with small businesses however - even the world famous Cheltenham Racecourse, and The Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham have benefited from some of your ideas! 

I have also taken many of your suggestions to heart, building an impressive though as yet unpublished collection of health and safety hints and tips numbering over three thousand, and getting up one hour early every day (well nearly every day!) to write about health and safety matters. 

Inspired by your general approach, I took the bull by the horns when approached by my local diocese of the Church Of England last year for "a bit of advice" on asbestos and landed up writing a detailed guidance manual aimed at helping churchwardens and others to comply with the legislation at considerably lower cost than calling in a "professional", many of whom are anything but. 

Self publishing the manual and attending to its printing and distribution have all stemmed from past items in The Achievers Edge and have certainly ensured that it was available far more speedily than by other means even if it has entailed a lot more work. And all of it in my "spare time" - time which I would not even have realised was available but for your insights. 

On reflection, I wonder why I have never contacted you personally before and have no ready explanation although I have been known to phone your office to check that tapes are on their way from time to time - I must be keen!

Peter is a master of his craft, a true communicator and an inspiration. Steve had some powerful thoughts to convey, an excellent rapport builder!

Carl Jarvis





You've raised the bar for me with the quantity and quality of 1st class practical information – This was my first experience of Peter Thomson's organisation – It won't be my last

John Wigham





Thoroughly enjoyable, hugely informative.

Tina Parnell





It's given me the confidence to be creative again. Practical, no nonsense information delivered with humour from a place of a wealth of experience. Many thanks

Jacky Leonard





I knew I would learn a lot and get a lot of valuable information from the workshop, but I wasn't prepared for how confident and excited I would be feeling about creating the content for my product. The process Peter took us through for generating content really does make it so simple to do, and I know now I'll be creating forever

Andy Edwards





Before coming on this workshop I knew that I wanted to create products, but wasn't sure how to go about it. Now I have the confidence to create unlimited material that's good quality. And a full road map on how to put that into products and successfully market it.

Tanya Smith





Thank you for reminding me of what I'd forgotten and for infusing me with new ideas. You're never too old to learn something new.

Duncan Tift





It really opened to my eyes the possibilities of marketing your product! Not something I have understood before although utilising my skill but giving away for very little return!

Sally Lawson





I thought I was commercial…until I met Peter There are a handful of people in my life who have been a positive influence. Peter has been and still is one of those people.In the 7 years I have known Peter I moved from being a practising accountant to a professional speaker and trainer. When I started I used to charge a fee ,which didn't reach 4 figures. With Peter's help, coaching, cajoling and even pushing that figure now have a 4 in front of it.Peter inspires you to be the best you can be at a price, which is sensible. He shows you it is all about value to the client not the hourly rate or what you think it worth.When Peter says, "Your fee is too low" …listen to him and then take action. It is only your self-imposed limiting beliefs that stop you being paid what you are truly worth.

Will Kintish, UK leading authority on networking skills





An excellent course packed full of practical ideas that will teach anyone to create, produce and sell info products successfully. 

Sanjay Shah





Whether you want to find your creativity, or implement it, this course is for you! Tons of information, practical experience and proven tried and tested systems. This is excellent stuff you cannot fail to make money with.

Billy Harvey





As a real novice in this area, I did think this workshop might be over my head. I couldn't have been more wrong. Peter made it simple, gave great advice, the stories painted such a picture that I believe I can really do this. It turns out it's not as hard as it looks. The templates make it easy to take away and you know exactly what you have to do, not just theory. Excellent.

Barbara Tift





I personally believe The Achievers Edge is one of the most powerful inspirational / motivational programmes I have come across, to the extent...... where I can not wait for it to hit my mat each month,
there are so many ideas that I have taken from these programmes which have empowered my business and personal life".

Robbie DJ Atherton
Sales Director Hair Products





Brilliant – Putting ideas into an actionable template. Lots of fun and really good content throughout the whole course. If I can't be successful in product development after this – I don't know what would work. This is great! I now have the power to be successful (and expertise)

Wendy Howard





Just 8 ideas which will make me an extra £500 would have paid for this twice over. As it turned out I learned at least 20 ideas that will make that every month forever. Genius.

Dave Shillito





The best that is in me can now come out!

Brian Gibb





As a founder Achiever's edge subscriber I look forward to my copy every month.
 
It is packed full of great ideas as well as some fantastic interviews with current "Movers and Shakers" and excellent exerts from motivational audio programmes.
 
As a result of a recent section by Peter on how to write a book or plan a seminar I am now engaged with an agent and have started writing my first book. Peter's advice here has been invaluable.
 
All in all, a great source of advice, motivation, ideas and inspiration all for such a small sum. What a bargain!

Brian Burns





Great seminar

Colin Needham





As a real novice in this area, I did think this workshop might be over my head. I couldn't have been more wrong.

Barbara Tift





I've been receiving Achievers Edge for many years now and the number of sales, marketing and promotional ideas I've got from it has been amazing. There's something in every issue to pay for the subscription many times over.
 
I took just one idea from one issue...used it on my website, and generated £5,750 in extra sales in the first week.
  
Anyone who runs a business, and doesn't make money from what they hear on the Achievers Edge is either not listening...or not acting on what they hear.

John Harrison
Streetwise Publications





The workshop has reignited my passion to succeed. I am more determined and confident than ever that I have developed an amazing product ready to market. Now I have the tools to market using Peter's proven "template" for success.

Simon Teague





This has been a turning point for me. Packed with valuable and relevant detail and delivered with sincerity and generosity. Everyone would benefit from attending.

Marusja Harasymiw





Peter has helped me focus so much on what I already know but wasn't applying. I've come away with great clarity of thought for putting this into practice rapidly.

Susie Heath





Wow! What a whirlwind of mind blowing information that is sure to make a dramatic difference to my business. Peter captivates his audience and is a genius at what he does. I would recommend anyone to experience what I have; thank you Peter. 

Audrey Spearing





...a monthly dose of thought provoking ideas for work and home.
                        Ideal for setting the mind in positive mode on the drive to work.
                        A stimulating counter to driver fatigue on long journeys
                        
                        I certainly find the last sentence particularly useful. Radio and music make me drowsy but not the Achiever's Edge!

Simon Browne





I expected a good course but it was better than that. Peter demolished my blocks and excuses. I know I can make it happen now.

Michael V C





Lots of valuable information to take me to the next level and as importantly the other people I met and the new partnerships created as a result of this weekend – the best is yet to come.

Masha Malka





Excellent course; thoroughly enjoyable, learnt so much.

Chris Webb





Peter's knowledge, passion and commitment to the mastery of his trade are beyond any other self-help leader I've come across to date. The training is priceless. Peter is an extraordinarily generous man with his time and knowledge and his willingness to help others.

Karl Dawson





Warm approachable team helped me to 'buzz' with ideas. It felt good to be so creative. Thank you.

Rebeka Roberts





I always look forward to receiving 'The Achiever's Edge' each month. Apart from the enormous variety of helpful articles, the great thing is that all the ideas have been 'tried and tested' in the real world, which is much more useful than receiving material which is good in theory and might or might not work in practice.

Colin Treacher





Great workshop! Thank you.

Bernadene Canning





Practical ideas that will get you started today!

David Knowles Leak





Excellent course – I believe Peter has all the tools you need to multiply the profits of your business so much – and even more.

Steven McGeown





Awesome!

John Canning





Peter and the team deliver – fact! This is a truly inspirational experience.

Martin Cornes





As a guest of my husband I found the workshop very inspiring and could see the impact it had on those around me. I would recommend it without hesitation.

Heather Cornes





As ever thought-provoking, exciting, energising giving me the fuel to fire the energy to take my business to the next level. Thanks for the weekend it was awesome.

Doug Green





As a Training Manager, I have used many of the ideas from The Achiever's Edge in training courses and coaching sessions. I particularly remember the extremely powerful story of the Mexican Fisherman. I've used the story several times - at work and with friends - to help others see things in context. Another great idea was featured in last month's edition - the idea for conveying the power of demonstrations using the strap-line, "Don't tell me how funny you are; just make me laugh." This is one that I will definitely use in the future.
 
In addition to the many great ideas, another benefit of the Achiever's Edge is that it helps keeps my mind tuned for continual learning and trying new things.
  
I would recommend it to anyone who wants more out of life - at work and at home, as well as those interested in their own personal development.
  
Thanks for producing such a great life-support tool!!!

Steve Blake
Training Manager





The energy, enthusiasm and the sheer generosity of Peter and his team demonstrated during the two days was awesome!

Lorne Mitchell





The course was organised and professional. It took me out of my comfort zone which has put different areas of my life into perspective.

Susie Mitchell





If you need to learn about business and success you need to learn from the best. Peter is one of those people.

Paul Thwaite





I feel the course is amazing value and covered more than I expected and would urge anyone to participate as I know it's going to make a huge impact in my life and it will in yours. Many thanks again Peter.

Ben Davidson





Loads of information that will be extremely useful. Peter is an inspiration but full of humility. We were made to feel that our success is very important Peter and his team. I would recommend this course only to proactive people that need guidance. 

Dale S





Excellent!  Stuck for words – how ironic but – thank you. 

Chris Williams





I'm glad I took up the offer to attend this two-day workshop. It is amazing and incredible what I've learnt. I also met some dedicated delegates and I promise that I will use my experience here is a turning point in my life and change the direction of my life for the good and the better and the best thank you.

Fatima Nuzhath

Lorne Mitchell





Many thanks for creating 'The Achiever's Edge', I always look forward to its arrival. It's given me a huge amount of knowledge and inspiration over the years, in relation to business and personal aspects. I've purchased a number of other really useful programmes too, brought to my attention through 'The Edge'. Again, many thanks!

John East





A great weekend full of ideas which will help my business in many more ways than I thought possible. Peter has a lovely relaxed style which makes listening to him a real pleasure.

Simon Rollings





This course was so very worthwhile. Fantastic and practical and useful information. I invested time and money and was repaid in multiples. Lovely people professionally presented. Thank you.

Moira O'Reilly





I came with a great idea in chaotic fashion and I'm leaving with a great idea with the system, structure and the tools to put it all together and be successful.

Robert Djemil





The course was totally absorbing; full of humour, energy, wisdom and practical ways of achieving a successful information business. All the components were covered in the course. The backup staff and Peter were brilliant and friends were made.

Peter Cale





Thanks Peter for a fantastic weekend. Your passion, integrity and great practical ideas are superb. Great to learn from someone who walks the talk.

Mark B





I have been a subscriber of The Achiever's Edge for 7½ years and I think I have found something that is really good value for money. I use ideas from the programme in my business and private life and I like the Personal Development and the Guest Presenter sections.
 
I have found for example the 'checkerboard system' very useful in keeping records of contacts with customers. The series of Nancy Slessenger on 'how to deal with difficult people' helped me a lot in private life as well. The programs are interesting, useful and sometimes also good fun. I still remember the puzzles about the three bulbs in one room and the others. 
  
I recommend The Achievers Edge to all my colleagues and friends

Tibor Cserep





Why spend years working this out for yourself when Peter can show you the way.

Mark Nugent





I came without a product. I left knowing that (in fact) I had an incredible one and how to make it successful. Peter is simply awesome.

James Wright





A great course and real value for money.

John Holman





Brilliant. I wish I had known about this information years ago. I believe my income could be 10 times what it is now.

Val Plummer





I attended one event where Peter was speaking and this follow up workshop as a result of purchasing the Product Creation Workshop Home Study Course. I have learnt more from him than I did from college or training courses. His generosity, over delivery and abundance mentality is a testament to his prosperity. Thank you

Noreen Makosewe





As you know I have been a subscriber and ardent fan of 
Achievers Edge for some years now.  I have learned so much over the years and grown in confidence. One thing I have learned is to keep my mind open and alert, read lots and then read lots more. Look at how others have grown, look at their mistakes and most important look at the way they NEVER give up no matter how much the world seemed to be against them.  I listen over and over again to past tapes when I am alone or in the car constantly picking up something new each time.
In my own life, I took on the care of my very ill parents...to their death both within the past 11 months...left my secure job and gave 100% to care and love of 2 people who gave me everything throughout my life that was moral and good.
 
Rather than waste my days, along with my husband we created, wrote and now publish a brand new Glossy magazine which is now on its 3rd issue and will be officially launched at a celebrity evening next Tuesday 1st February.
 
Peter, a few years back I would have looked at the situation as giving up a career, but having listened to you and your wonderful guest speakers I automatically thought, ..great,  this is my new challenge to change direction and achieve something new.  The new venture is a tribute to my parents' belief and support and also a tribute to your advice and teachings.

Roisin Hall





Peter sets you free from pre conceived ideas and beliefs

Norman Plummer





Peter's training is practical, down to earth and simple to implement. Added to that, Peter's style is like being in your own stand-up show all day! Thank you again – always massive value.

Diana Barden





Peter creates a comfortable workshop which is relaxed and involving and light bulb invoking all at the same time – a model session. Very enjoyable.

Roy MacMillan





I always find the Achiever's Edge to be truly MOTIVATIONAL in every way:
                        
Memorable
Original
Time-saving
Interesting
Valuable
Amusing
Terrifically
Inspiring
Outside-the-box
Necessary (or would you prefer "nourishing" or "noteworthy"?!)
And
Long-lasting

                        The monthly tape is now an integral part of my routine - an hour's walk with my 3 Dogs, listening to the latest "Achiever's Edge" - they seem to benefit from it, too!

John Eaton





Great day – full of how and what hints you need to bring your product to market

Mike Burge





Thank you so much, it's been very insightful. I will recommend you to anyone relevant. I feel able to go away and go for it now.

Beverley Carson





It's great to give you some feedback after all the ideas I have benefited from over the years as an Achiever's Edge subscriber.
  
I can't wait to get it every month and I eagerly play it on my journeys around the M25 or my trips to Birmingham. (The university on wheels)
  
In particular I just love the interviews with people. Even Paul Daniels was great and I never thought I would learn about business from him. How wrong!
  
The monthly CDs are a great concept and the bit about some Nightingale Conant programmes is a great preview (try before you Buy) concept.
  
Two ideas which are part on my personality now are:
 
(1)  Average order value, average frequency of purchase and increase the number of customers! This had        made me money as well as others!
(2)  Action is the key! 

Mike Jones





Peter is an excellent fun teacher who lives what he shares. Living proof of what is possible. Thank you

Joe Best





Peter is fun, ecstatic, amazing at helping us realise our unique selves and helping us implement our ideas. Thank you

Sharon Holdstock

Description
Peter Thompson – Preparation for the 800m
Peter John L Thompson is a coach of British birth who has coached athletes to world record performances for over 40 years.  
From 1990, he worked over a twenty-year period for the world governing body for Track & Field Athletics, the International Association of Athletics Federations. 
Most recently, he was a Senior Manager and the Event Group Editor for Endurance for the IAAF, 2006-2011 and appointed European Endurance Leader by the European Athletics Coaches Association, also in 2006.  
The athletes he has coached have competed in the Olympic Games,
Commonwealth Games and International Association of Athletics
Federations (IAAF) Track & Field World Championships, Road World  Championships and Cross Country World Championships. 
He has coached all the disciplines of Track & Field Athletics and was the  first coach, 1972-1976, to decathlete Daley Thompson – World Junior  Record holder, four World Records, two Olympic Gold medals, three Commonwealth  Games titles and Gold medals in the IAAF World Championships and European Championships.  
But since 1978 Peter has concentrated on the middle and long distance  events where he formally innovated the New Interval Training method  in  1995, after developing and using the method from 1975. 
In addition to coaching his own squad of athletes, he has coached coaches and coached athletes on camps and clinics in 45 countries and representing approximately 164 of the countries of the 213 Member Federations of the IAAF. 
He coached in the U.S.A. from 1976-1990 Including the University of Oregon; Florida State University and Athletics West athletes, including Cathie Twomey, World Best 20 Km, World No. 9 at 5000m and Marty Cooksey, World Number 1 ranked road racer in 1986, World Bests for 20 Km, Half Marathon, 30 Km and twice at 15 Km. 
For the IAAF, he introduced a global 3-Level (1991) and then a 5-Level  (2009) IAAF Coaches Education and Certification System in seven languages. He has authored many publications, including:
– IAAF Code of Ethics for Coaches (1996, updated 2005).
– Introduction to Coaching – the Official IAAF Guide to Coaching Athletics (2009).
– Run! Jump! Throw! – the Official IAAF Guide to Teaching Athletics
 (2009). 
Between 2001 and 2011, when living in Oxford, he was the honorary coach  to the historic Oxford University Cross Country Club and the endurance,  800m-10,000m, coach to Oxford University Athletics Club.  
He has directed many world-class events during his coaching career, such  as the immediately post-apartheid, UK-South Africa Sports Initiative and was National Secretary and now a Vice President of the prestigious  British  Milers’ Club, which was founded in 1963 and has produced  world-class performance in British middle distance running. 
He received a Bachelor of Science Honours degree in Geology from the University of London, a Post Graduate Certificate of Education in Physical Education, Geography and Geology from Carnegie College, University of Leeds, a Master of Science in Biomechanics from the University of Oregon and undertook further Master studies in Sport Psychology and Doctoral studies in the Social Psychology of Sport at the University of Oregon. 
Peter practices an adaptation-led, rather than a training load-led,  approach to coaching, creating environments where the only limiting factor to an athlete’s achievement should be their genetic potential and self-determination.  
He currently lives in Eugene, Oregon and coaches the Spirit of Oregon club.
