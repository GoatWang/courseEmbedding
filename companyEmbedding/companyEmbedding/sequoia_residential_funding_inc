FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

What Local Florida Realtors are saying about R P Funding:

"We have been blown away with the attention to detail and the efficiency that RP funding has provided our clients. Most of the time it is like pulling teeth with folks in the mortgage industry. RP has simplified everything letting me as a realtor and my clients breathe a little bit easier. I will recommend all of my clients to use RP Funding, hands down." 

Lee Goldberg
		Realtor
		GCI Realty, Inc
		Orlando, Florida

"During the government's &dollar;8,000 home buying credit program, I was the listing agent for a single family home in the BVL area; the buyer had been diligently trying to secure his loan, but 10 days before the closing a last minute over-site by his chosen lender made him ineligible for their loan product and the buyer's agent had no back-up. I suggested to the buyer's agent that the buyer contact RP Funding to review the buyer's qualifications, before they just walked away. RP Funding came through; saving the sale by qualifying the buyer, saving his $8,000 credit and closing the deal on time. Result: all parties to the transaction (buyer, seller and agents) were very happy.
		
Thanks RP!!!"
		
Daniel J. Lopez
		Sales Agent
		Hometown Realty Group, Inc

"I discovered RP Funding through an email advertisement I received.	After looking at their website
		and speaking with Brandon Fields about their low closing costs, 10 day closings, and $1,000
		guarantee, I was anxious to give RP Funding a try.	I sent Brandon a client on Dec. 8th to get pre-
		approved and had a FULL loan approval by Dec. 17th.	Amazing!	Brandon Fields and his
		processor Jill Hoyle are fabulous to work with and they have definitely earned my business.
		RP Funding is the only place I will send my clients from now on!!"

Direct Mortgage Lender - Not a Bank and Not a Broker

The big banks are so backed up with refinances, many raised their rates to slow down volume. 
To a big bank you are just a number, and will most likely work with an out of state call center. 
Mortgage broker fees raise the cost of your refinance, as a Direct Lender you pay no Broker Fees.
We have the authority to underwrite and close your loan, and we do it in as little as 10 days right here in Orlando, Florida. †
Mortgage Rates in Florida will not stay this low for long, and with our fast process you can get in before it's too late.




No Games, No Pushy Sales People and BBB A-Rated
Most mortgage loan officers are paid commission and make extra money by selling you a higher interest
	rate, not here. We don't have pushy commission sales people, you will work directly with a Salaried Credit
	Manager who's only concern is earning your business, not making their next big commission check.
	This helps us keep our rates and fees low.
Based Locally in the Central FL area
Our office is just off of Interstate 4, Exit 90B in Maitland, Florida, just outside of Orlando. We would
	love to meet you in person, although you are welcome to complete the entire process over the phone,
	it's completely up to you.  We help home buyers and home owners all over Florida.
&dollar;1,000 "Best Florida Mortgage Rates" Guarantee
If you find a better loan somewhere else (which we doubt you can) and we can't beat it, we will give
	you a &dollar;1,000 Visa Gift Card.*

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
