Christmas Trees



Enjoy this Christmas season with a Christmas tree! By placing an artificial Christmas tree in your home, it’s easy to clean-up after the holidays and decorate the tree when the time is right. You can reuse an artificial Christmas tree each year, which makes it easy to pack away and store in your attic or basement. Artificial pre-lit Christmas trees are not only nice because they are easy to clean-up, but they also look as great as real, fresh-cut trees. You’ll find that there are many artificial yet realistic Christmas trees that are modeled after real trees, so you can find one that matches your preferred style. From fir to pine trees, you can choose a faux Christmas tree as the centerpiece for your home. When shopping for a new tree, make sure to check the size, style, and design to find one that will help you spread the holiday cheer to your friends and family. Whether you want a realistic looking tree or a white Christmas tree, we've got just what you need to decorate your home this holiday season.




Pre Lit Artificial Christmas Trees - The majority of realistic yet fake Christmas trees also come with pre-lit strands that are interwoven or attached to the tree itself. This means that you can get right to decorating your Christmas tree after taking it out of the box and fluffing the branches. You’ll find that pre-lit Christmas trees have two different types of light to choose from, including incandescent and LED. Incandescent bulbs emit a warm light that resembled a tiny flame. LED lights are made in a similar color; however, you can also find white LED lights if you prefer a brighter or contemporary Christmas tree design. That’s not to say that you cannot get an artificial xmas tree that is unlit, Wayfair also offers a number of unlit Christmas trees as well as lit ones. These come in different colors as well. Easily find white Christmas trees, green ones, or gold ones!

Artificial Christmas Tree Styles and Colors - You’ll find many different styles and designs of artificial Christmas trees. If you want your tree to look as though it’s been sitting out in the snow, then we have plenty of artificial flocked Christmas trees in many different shapes and sizes. You can also choose from trees with few lights, well others have thousands of lights that wrap around each layer. Artificial Christmas trees are decorated in the spirit of real trees, including fir, pine, spruce, cypress, and cedar. If you live in a tropical region, then you may also love our selection of artificial Christmas palm trees. If you’re not too particular about how realistic your tree looks, we also stock admittedly fake Christmas tree in a shockingly wide range of colors including green, blue, pink, purple, orange and yellow. Of course you can also find white Christmas trees to help you recreate the look of snow too! 

Artificial Christmas Tree Sizes - Once you’ve found a faux Christmas tree with the right type of lighting, you’ll also want to consider the size and shape. At 3 feet or less, mini Christmas trees are available for smaller rooms and spaces. Many of the smaller trees come in a variety of colors - find your white Christmas tree here and place it as a centerpiece on your table! The largest trees are over 12 foot Christmas trees that are perfect for the largest living or dining rooms. A 12 foot Christmas tree is also the perfect size for a retail or office building’s entryway. You can also choose the diameter of your Christmas tree by shopping from full, slender, or extra full. If you don’t have a lot of floor room, then an upside down Christmas tree or a slender artificial Christmas tree is a great choice for your home.
Some extremely popular Christmas tree sizes include:
4 foot Christmas trees: A 4 foot Christmas tree is the perfect size for a smaller room like a child’s bedroom or the foyer of your home. While a 4 foot mini Christmas tree won’t give you the space you need to gather your family around the tree, it does make for an ideal accent piece that you can locate practically anywhere.
7 foot Christmas trees: A sizable step up from the small 4 foot Christmas tree, the 7 foot Christmas tree is ideal for a medium sized living room or den. While relatively tall, a 7 foot Christmas tree, and the similarly sized 6 foot Christmas tree, is still short enough that you can position it in just about any room. Unless you have a lot of extended family over to visit, a 6 or 7 foot Christmas tree should give everyone you’re close with enough room to spread around the tree to exchange presents and holiday wishes.
9 foot Christmas trees: The largest size Christmas tree that is still widely used, a 9 foot Christmas tree is a good choice for very large, open rooms and ones with high vaulted ceilings. A 9 foot Christmas tree is large enough to accommodate even the largest of families spread around it.
Shop our Christmas trees and find the best one for your home and your family this Christmas.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
