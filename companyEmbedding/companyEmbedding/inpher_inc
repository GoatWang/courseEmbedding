 It used to be hard to use encrypted data.We have come to rely on instantaneous search and big data analytics, but the rapid adoption of encryption makes this difficult.  If you have to decrypt everything to search it, or rely on a third party service to manage it for you, it’s not only inefficient and expensive, but it also exposes the plaintext data- a vulnerability that hackers will inevitably exploit.
