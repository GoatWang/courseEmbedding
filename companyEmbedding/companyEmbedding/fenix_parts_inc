Company Overview



Fenix Parts is a leading recycler and reseller of original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") automotive products. Its primary business is auto recycling, which is the recovery and resale of OEM parts, components and systems reclaimed from damaged, totaled or low value vehicles. Customers include collision repair shops (body shops), mechanical repair shops, auto dealerships and individual retail customers. The company provides customers with high-quality recycled OEM products, extensive inventory and product availability, responsive customer service and fast delivery. Upon receipt of vehicles, which the company primarily purchases at auto salvage auctions, Fenix employees inventory and then dismantle the vehicles and sell the recycled components. The company operates a hub and spoke distribution network allowing it to efficiently move products among its locations and expedite delivery to customers. Fenix also generates a portion of its revenue from the sale of aftermarket parts, and from the sale as scrap of the unusable parts and materials.
Fenix was founded in January 2014 to combine eight Founding Companies and create a network that offers sales, fulfillment and distribution in key regional markets in the United States and Canada. The Fenix companies have been in business an average of more than 25 years and currently operate from 16 locations throughout the Eastern U.S. and Ontario, Canada.

Fenix Parts, Inc. Key Developments

Fenix Parts To Be Delisted From The Nasdaq 
Jun 28 17
Fenix Parts, Inc. announced that it has received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Hearings Department stating that, due to the Company’s non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), the Company would be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”) at the opening of business on June 29, 2017. As previously announced, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the "Panel") had issued a decision granting the Company’s request for an extension to file its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the “2016 Form 10-K”) and for its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017 (the “March 31, 2017 Form 10-Q”). The Company’s continued listing on the Nasdaq was conditioned on, among other things, the Company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) its 2016 Form 10-K by June 23, 2017 and its March 31, 2017 Form 10-Q by July 21, 2017. In addition, the Panel decision required the Company to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2017 on or before its normal due date of August 14, 2017. The Company was unable to satisfy the terms of the Panel’s conditional listing. It is anticipated that the Company's common stock will be quoted on the OTC Pink operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. (also known as the "Pink Sheets") subsequent to the effectiveness of the suspension of trading of the Company's common stock on Nasdaq. The Company continues to be actively engaged with its independent auditors to complete its annual audit and quarterly review so that the 2016 Form 10-K and March 31, 2017 Form 10-Q may be filed with the SEC as soon as possible.


Fenix Parts Receives Nasdaq Filing Extension
May 31 17
Fenix Parts, Inc. announced that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (Panel) issued a decision granting the Company’s request for an extension to file its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (2016 Form 10-K) and for its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017 (March 31, 2017 Form 10-Q). The Company’s continued listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market is subject to, among other things, the Company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) its 2016 Form 10-K by June 9, 2017 and its March 31, 2017 Form 10-Q by July 14, 2017. In addition, on or before August 14, 2017, the Company is required to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2017. The Company continues to be actively engaged with its independent auditors to expedite, to the extent possible, the completion of its annual audit and quarterly review so that the 2016 Form 10-K and March 31, 2017 Form 10-Q may be filed with the SEC as soon as possible.


Fenix Parts Receives Letter From Nasdaq Relating To Its Delayed First Quarter 10-Q Filing
May 18 17
Fenix Parts, Inc. announced that, as expected, it received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because it did not timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a reminder, on April 5, 2017, the Company announced that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel issued a decision granting the Company’s request for the continued listing of its common stock on Nasdaq. The Company’s continued listing on Nasdaq was subject to, among other things, the Company filing with the SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 by May 26, 2017. In addition, on or before June 30, 2017, the Company is required to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017.

Its recycled OEM products include mechanical parts used to repair worn or damaged components, such as engines and transmissions, and collision repair parts used to repair vehicles typically involved in a collision, such as door assemblies, trunk lids, lights, fenders and other products.

Fenix's stock plummets on heavy volume after delisting announcement
Shares of Fenix Parts Inc.  plummeted 64% to a record low in relatively active afternoon trade Wednesday, after the recycler and resaler of automotive products said its stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq starting Thursday because it has been unable to file its 2016 annual report in a timely manner. Volume was 2.8 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 141,000 shares. The stock is expected to begin trading on OTC Markets Group's OTC Pink market after the delisting. Separately, Fenix announced an amendment to the agreement with its creditors, in which the lenders will refrain until Aug. 31 from exercising rights with respect to Fenix's noncompliance with certain financial covenants. The agreement also allows the company to add the quarterly interest payment due for the second quarter to the principal amount of debt, and to defer a principal payment of $250,000 that was due Friday to the end of August. The stock, which went public on May 14, 2015 at an IPO price of $8, and closed as high as $11.51 on June 3, 2015, traded recently at 57 cents. It has lost 80% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.
