Sir Magdi Habib Yacoub OM FRS (Arabic: مجدى حبيب يعقوب‎‎ [ˈmæɡdi ħæˈbiːb jæʕˈʔuːb]; born 16 November 1935) is an Egyptian-British cardiothoracic surgeon. He is Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Imperial College London.[1][2][3][4]




(Order of Merit) 2014


Yacoub's major achievements may be summarised:

establishing heart transplantation in the UK and becoming the world's leading transplant surgeon
establishing and becoming a master of the 'Ross Procedure' or pulmonary autograft, including a randomised control trial
pioneering the modern arterial switch operation
promoting the use of left ventricular assist devices for the 'Bridge to Recovery' and establishing the largest experience in the world
establishing the Heart Science Centre, Magdi Yacoub Institute for research into the causes and treatment of cardiac disease
establishing the Chain of Hope Charity which provides cardiothoracic surgical care to the developing world
championing academic medicine, humanitarian surgery and becoming an example of a minority surgeon who has flourished in an institution-dominated field.

He was involved in the restart of British heart transplantion in 1980 (there had been a moratorium following the series of three performed by Donald Ross in 1968), carried out the first British live lobe lung transplant and went on to perform more transplants than any other surgeon in the world. A 1980 patient, Derrick Morris, was Europe's longest surviving heart transplant recipient until his death in July 2005. This record was superseded by John McCafferty who received a transplant at Harefield Hospital in Middlesex on 20 October 1982 and survived over 33 years, until 10 February 2016. He was officially recognised as the world's longest surviving heart transplant patient by Guinness World Records in 2013. A March 1978 heart by-pass patient continues to live a very active and fruitful life (as of November, 2016).[citation needed]He is also the head of Magdi Yacoub heart foundation, which launched Aswan Heart project.[5]

Early life and career[edit]
The son of a surgeon of a Coptic Christian family, Yacoub was born on 16 November 1935 in Bilbeis, Al Sharqia, Egypt. He studied at Cairo University and qualified as a doctor in 1957. He reportedly said he decided to specialise in heart surgery after an aunt died of heart disease in her early 20s. He moved to Britain in 1962, then taught at the University of Chicago. He became a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Harefield Hospital in 1973. As a visiting professor to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Yacoub, Fabian Udekwu and others performed the first open heart surgery in Nigeria in 1974.[6]
The Harefield transplant programme[edit]
Under Yacoub's leadership, the Harefield Hospital transplant programme began in 1980 and by the end of the decade he and his team had performed 1000 of the procedures and Harefield Hospital had become the leading UK transplant centre. During this period there was an increase in post-operative survival rates, a reduction in the recovery periods spent in isolation and in the financial cost of each procedure. To remove donor hearts, he would travel thousands of miles each year in small aircraft or helicopters. Most of his patients received treatment under the National Health Service, but some private foreign patients were also treated.
In December 1983 Yacoub performed the UK's first heart and lung transplant at Harefield.[7]
He was appointed professor at the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1986, and was involved in the development of the techniques of heart and heart-lung transplantation.
Andreas Papandreou open heart surgery at Harefield and popularity in Greece[edit]
Between August and October 1988 Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou was hospitalized at Harefield, which he entered at a very critical condition, and Yacoub performed an open heart triple bypass surgery on the Prime Minister, saving his life.[8][9] Yacoub has since become famous in Greece (Papandreou's health problems and surgery were the top news stories in Greece for months), and Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou himself said that Yacoub saved him.[10]
Recent work[edit]
Having retired from performing surgery for the National Health Service in 2001 at the age of 65, Yacoub continues to act as a high-profile consultant and ambassador for the benefits of transplant surgery. He continues to operate on children through his charity, Chain of Hope.
In 2006 he briefly came out of retirement to advise on a complicated procedure which required removing a transplant heart from a patient whose own heart had recovered. The patient's original heart had not been removed during transplant surgery nearly a decade earlier in the hope it might recover.[11]
In April 2007, it was reported that a British medical research team led by Yacoub had grown part of a human heart valve , from stem cells; a first.[12]
Other activities and achievements[edit]

He is also notable for saving many lives by pioneering a technique for 'switching' the heart vessels of babies born with transposition of the great arteries, a congenital heart defect in which the two major vessels carrying blood out of the heart, the aorta and the pulmonary artery, are switched.
In 1994 he founded the charity Chain in Hope (www.chainofhope.org). This charity aims to provide children suffering from life-threatening disease with the corrective surgery and treatment to which they do not have access.
Among celebrities whose lives he extended was the comedian Eric Morecambe. He was also known to have treated the famous Egyptian actor Omar Sharif, urging the latter to give up the cigarettes that had led to his heart attack.
In 2002 he was selected to spearhead a government recruitment drive for overseas doctors.
He has had a house named after him at The Petchey Academy which opened in September 2006.
He is one of few masters and teachers in the world of the highly technically demanding "Ross Procedure".
He established the Aswan Heart Center in April 2009.[13]

Honours and awards[edit]

1998 Texas Heart Institute Ray C. Fish Award for Scientific Achievement in Cardiovascular Disease
1999 Lifetime outstanding achievement award in recognition of contribution to medicine, Secretary of State for Health (UK)

Yacoub was knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours and awarded the Order of Merit by HM The Queen in the 2014 New Year Honours.[15]
Guinness World record[edit]
John McCafferty, an Englishman, received his new heart on 20 October 1982 in a procedure carried out by Yacoub.[16] As of December 2013[update] McCafferty entered the record books as the world's longest-surviving heart transplant patient, surpassing the previous Guinness World Record of 30 years, 11 months and 10 days set by an American man who died in 2009.[17]

Sir Magdi Habib Yacoub OM FRS (Arabic: مجدى حبيب يعقوب‎‎ [ˈmæɡdi ħæˈbiːb jæʕˈʔuːb]; born 16 November 1935) is an Egyptian-British cardiothoracic surgeon. He is Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Imperial College London.[1][2][3][4]




(Order of Merit) 2014


Yacoub's major achievements may be summarised:

establishing heart transplantation in the UK and becoming the world's leading transplant surgeon
establishing and becoming a master of the 'Ross Procedure' or pulmonary autograft, including a randomised control trial
pioneering the modern arterial switch operation
promoting the use of left ventricular assist devices for the 'Bridge to Recovery' and establishing the largest experience in the world
establishing the Heart Science Centre, Magdi Yacoub Institute for research into the causes and treatment of cardiac disease
establishing the Chain of Hope Charity which provides cardiothoracic surgical care to the developing world
championing academic medicine, humanitarian surgery and becoming an example of a minority surgeon who has flourished in an institution-dominated field.

He was involved in the restart of British heart transplantion in 1980 (there had been a moratorium following the series of three performed by Donald Ross in 1968), carried out the first British live lobe lung transplant and went on to perform more transplants than any other surgeon in the world. A 1980 patient, Derrick Morris, was Europe's longest surviving heart transplant recipient until his death in July 2005. This record was superseded by John McCafferty who received a transplant at Harefield Hospital in Middlesex on 20 October 1982 and survived over 33 years, until 10 February 2016. He was officially recognised as the world's longest surviving heart transplant patient by Guinness World Records in 2013. A March 1978 heart by-pass patient continues to live a very active and fruitful life (as of November, 2016).[citation needed]He is also the head of Magdi Yacoub heart foundation, which launched Aswan Heart project.[5]

Early life and career[edit]
The son of a surgeon of a Coptic Christian family, Yacoub was born on 16 November 1935 in Bilbeis, Al Sharqia, Egypt. He studied at Cairo University and qualified as a doctor in 1957. He reportedly said he decided to specialise in heart surgery after an aunt died of heart disease in her early 20s. He moved to Britain in 1962, then taught at the University of Chicago. He became a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Harefield Hospital in 1973. As a visiting professor to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Yacoub, Fabian Udekwu and others performed the first open heart surgery in Nigeria in 1974.[6]
The Harefield transplant programme[edit]
Under Yacoub's leadership, the Harefield Hospital transplant programme began in 1980 and by the end of the decade he and his team had performed 1000 of the procedures and Harefield Hospital had become the leading UK transplant centre. During this period there was an increase in post-operative survival rates, a reduction in the recovery periods spent in isolation and in the financial cost of each procedure. To remove donor hearts, he would travel thousands of miles each year in small aircraft or helicopters. Most of his patients received treatment under the National Health Service, but some private foreign patients were also treated.
In December 1983 Yacoub performed the UK's first heart and lung transplant at Harefield.[7]
He was appointed professor at the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1986, and was involved in the development of the techniques of heart and heart-lung transplantation.
Andreas Papandreou open heart surgery at Harefield and popularity in Greece[edit]
Between August and October 1988 Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou was hospitalized at Harefield, which he entered at a very critical condition, and Yacoub performed an open heart triple bypass surgery on the Prime Minister, saving his life.[8][9] Yacoub has since become famous in Greece (Papandreou's health problems and surgery were the top news stories in Greece for months), and Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou himself said that Yacoub saved him.[10]
Recent work[edit]
Having retired from performing surgery for the National Health Service in 2001 at the age of 65, Yacoub continues to act as a high-profile consultant and ambassador for the benefits of transplant surgery. He continues to operate on children through his charity, Chain of Hope.
In 2006 he briefly came out of retirement to advise on a complicated procedure which required removing a transplant heart from a patient whose own heart had recovered. The patient's original heart had not been removed during transplant surgery nearly a decade earlier in the hope it might recover.[11]
In April 2007, it was reported that a British medical research team led by Yacoub had grown part of a human heart valve , from stem cells; a first.[12]
Other activities and achievements[edit]

He is also notable for saving many lives by pioneering a technique for 'switching' the heart vessels of babies born with transposition of the great arteries, a congenital heart defect in which the two major vessels carrying blood out of the heart, the aorta and the pulmonary artery, are switched.
In 1994 he founded the charity Chain in Hope (www.chainofhope.org). This charity aims to provide children suffering from life-threatening disease with the corrective surgery and treatment to which they do not have access.
Among celebrities whose lives he extended was the comedian Eric Morecambe. He was also known to have treated the famous Egyptian actor Omar Sharif, urging the latter to give up the cigarettes that had led to his heart attack.
In 2002 he was selected to spearhead a government recruitment drive for overseas doctors.
He has had a house named after him at The Petchey Academy which opened in September 2006.
He is one of few masters and teachers in the world of the highly technically demanding "Ross Procedure".
He established the Aswan Heart Center in April 2009.[13]

Yacoub was knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours and awarded the Order of Merit by HM The Queen in the 2014 New Year Honours.[15]
Guinness World record[edit]
John McCafferty, an Englishman, received his new heart on 20 October 1982 in a procedure carried out by Yacoub.[16] As of December 2013[update] McCafferty entered the record books as the world's longest-surviving heart transplant patient, surpassing the previous Guinness World Record of 30 years, 11 months and 10 days set by an American man who died in 2009.[17]

Sir Magdi Habib Yacoub OM FRS (Arabic: مجدى حبيب يعقوب‎‎ [ˈmæɡdi ħæˈbiːb jæʕˈʔuːb]; born 16 November 1935) is an Egyptian-British cardiothoracic surgeon. He is Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Imperial College London.[1][2][3][4]




(Order of Merit) 2014


Yacoub's major achievements may be summarised:

establishing heart transplantation in the UK and becoming the world's leading transplant surgeon
establishing and becoming a master of the 'Ross Procedure' or pulmonary autograft, including a randomised control trial
pioneering the modern arterial switch operation
promoting the use of left ventricular assist devices for the 'Bridge to Recovery' and establishing the largest experience in the world
establishing the Heart Science Centre, Magdi Yacoub Institute for research into the causes and treatment of cardiac disease
establishing the Chain of Hope Charity which provides cardiothoracic surgical care to the developing world
championing academic medicine, humanitarian surgery and becoming an example of a minority surgeon who has flourished in an institution-dominated field.

He was involved in the restart of British heart transplantion in 1980 (there had been a moratorium following the series of three performed by Donald Ross in 1968), carried out the first British live lobe lung transplant and went on to perform more transplants than any other surgeon in the world. A 1980 patient, Derrick Morris, was Europe's longest surviving heart transplant recipient until his death in July 2005. This record was superseded by John McCafferty who received a transplant at Harefield Hospital in Middlesex on 20 October 1982 and survived over 33 years, until 10 February 2016. He was officially recognised as the world's longest surviving heart transplant patient by Guinness World Records in 2013. A March 1978 heart by-pass patient continues to live a very active and fruitful life (as of November, 2016).[citation needed]He is also the head of Magdi Yacoub heart foundation, which launched Aswan Heart project.[5]

Early life and career[edit]
The son of a surgeon of a Coptic Christian family, Yacoub was born on 16 November 1935 in Bilbeis, Al Sharqia, Egypt. He studied at Cairo University and qualified as a doctor in 1957. He reportedly said he decided to specialise in heart surgery after an aunt died of heart disease in her early 20s. He moved to Britain in 1962, then taught at the University of Chicago. He became a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Harefield Hospital in 1973. As a visiting professor to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Yacoub, Fabian Udekwu and others performed the first open heart surgery in Nigeria in 1974.[6]
The Harefield transplant programme[edit]
Under Yacoub's leadership, the Harefield Hospital transplant programme began in 1980 and by the end of the decade he and his team had performed 1000 of the procedures and Harefield Hospital had become the leading UK transplant centre. During this period there was an increase in post-operative survival rates, a reduction in the recovery periods spent in isolation and in the financial cost of each procedure. To remove donor hearts, he would travel thousands of miles each year in small aircraft or helicopters. Most of his patients received treatment under the National Health Service, but some private foreign patients were also treated.
In December 1983 Yacoub performed the UK's first heart and lung transplant at Harefield.[7]
He was appointed professor at the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1986, and was involved in the development of the techniques of heart and heart-lung transplantation.
Andreas Papandreou open heart surgery at Harefield and popularity in Greece[edit]
Between August and October 1988 Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou was hospitalized at Harefield, which he entered at a very critical condition, and Yacoub performed an open heart triple bypass surgery on the Prime Minister, saving his life.[8][9] Yacoub has since become famous in Greece (Papandreou's health problems and surgery were the top news stories in Greece for months), and Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou himself said that Yacoub saved him.[10]
Recent work[edit]
Having retired from performing surgery for the National Health Service in 2001 at the age of 65, Yacoub continues to act as a high-profile consultant and ambassador for the benefits of transplant surgery. He continues to operate on children through his charity, Chain of Hope.
In 2006 he briefly came out of retirement to advise on a complicated procedure which required removing a transplant heart from a patient whose own heart had recovered. The patient's original heart had not been removed during transplant surgery nearly a decade earlier in the hope it might recover.[11]
In April 2007, it was reported that a British medical research team led by Yacoub had grown part of a human heart valve , from stem cells; a first.[12]
Other activities and achievements[edit]

He is also notable for saving many lives by pioneering a technique for 'switching' the heart vessels of babies born with transposition of the great arteries, a congenital heart defect in which the two major vessels carrying blood out of the heart, the aorta and the pulmonary artery, are switched.
In 1994 he founded the charity Chain in Hope (www.chainofhope.org). This charity aims to provide children suffering from life-threatening disease with the corrective surgery and treatment to which they do not have access.
Among celebrities whose lives he extended was the comedian Eric Morecambe. He was also known to have treated the famous Egyptian actor Omar Sharif, urging the latter to give up the cigarettes that had led to his heart attack.
In 2002 he was selected to spearhead a government recruitment drive for overseas doctors.
He has had a house named after him at The Petchey Academy which opened in September 2006.
He is one of few masters and teachers in the world of the highly technically demanding "Ross Procedure".
He established the Aswan Heart Center in April 2009.[13]

Yacoub was knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours and awarded the Order of Merit by HM The Queen in the 2014 New Year Honours.[15]
Guinness World record[edit]
John McCafferty, an Englishman, received his new heart on 20 October 1982 in a procedure carried out by Yacoub.[16] As of December 2013[update] McCafferty entered the record books as the world's longest-surviving heart transplant patient, surpassing the previous Guinness World Record of 30 years, 11 months and 10 days set by an American man who died in 2009.[17]
