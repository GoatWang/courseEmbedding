Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsIn recent years our understanding of the genetic links to cardiovascular disease has increased dramatically, helping to redefine the etiology and diagnostic criteria for numerous conditions, and allowing the development of novel, individualized treatments. In Principles of Molecular Cardiology leading specialists explore all the latest developments in molecular cardiologic research and therapy. The authors explain in a concise yet readable style the complex process of the heart's development, the molecular bases of cardiovascular diseases, and the translation of these research advances to actual clinical treatments. The expert information provided here serves as an invaluable building block for novel treatments of cardiovascular diseases, and includes a comprehensive discussion of cardiac function and dysfunction, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, vascular diseases, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These state-of-the-art approaches to molecular cardiologic research include critical discussion of such topics as the molecular events that regulate angiogenesis and the potential for angiogenic therapy, emerging therapies for arrhythmias, and a description of the molecular biology of aging and its impact on the cardiovascular system. Authoritative and up-to-date, Principles of Molecular Cardiology offers cardiovascular scientists and fellows not only a quick yet insightful tour from bench to bedside of the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease, but also an introduction to the just-now emerging therapies based on our enriched understanding of the heart's molecular biology and genetics.ReviewFrom the Foreword... "I believe that this is an outstanding book. Anyone interested in the development, genetics, and pathologies that affect the cardiovascular system will want to have Principles of Molecular Cardiology available for ready reference." -James T. Willerson, MD  From the reviews:  "...should be in any pediatric library, not to say cardiac departments." - Pediatric Endocrinology Reviews  "This book ... provides a broad and up-to-date treatment of molecular biology of cardiovascular diseases. Certainly this book shows quite thoroughly the direction in which cardiology is moving." (American Journal of Cardiology, December, 2005)     "...shows quite thoroughly the direction in which cardiology is moving." -American Journal of Cardiology    SynopsisAn easy-to-read survey of all the latest developments in molecular cardiologic research and therapy. The authors explain in a readable style the complex process of the heart's development, the molecular basis of cardiovascular diseases, and the translation of these research advances to actual clinical treatments. The expert information provided here serves as an invaluable building block for novel treatments of cardiovascular diseases and includes a comprehensive discussion of cardiac function and dysfunction, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, vascular diseases, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These state-of-the-art approaches to molecular cardiologic research include critical discussion of such topics as the molecular events that regulate angiogenesis and the potential for angiogenic therapy, emerging therapies for arrhythmias, and a description of the molecular biology of aging and its impact on the cardiovascular system.Table of ContentsPart I.

Netter's Cardiology
Any medical student or practicing physician will know what I mean when I say Netter's art is without peer. I've been searching for a quick-reference book in this field and now I've found it. The writing and format are precise (no wasted words here!) and the illustrations really bring it to life. I've used a few of the 5-Minute Consult books but they don't compare to this.  However  the information given in the book is quite minimal  So it is not a full very detailed reference book!(review of previous edition)
