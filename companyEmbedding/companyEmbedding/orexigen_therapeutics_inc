Important Safety Information

CONTRAVE can cause serious side effects of suicidal thoughts or actions. One of the ingredients in CONTRAVE is bupropion HCl. Bupropion has caused some people to have suicidal thoughts or actions or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking medicines used to treat depression. Bupropion may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. If you already have depression or other mental illnesses, taking bupropion may cause it to get worse, especially within the first few months of treatment.
Stop taking CONTRAVE and call a healthcare provider right away if you, or your family member, have any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying; attempts to commit suicide; depression; anxiety; feeling very agitated or restless; panic attacks; trouble sleeping (insomnia); irritability; acting aggressive, being angry or violent; acting on dangerous impulses; an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania); other unusual changes in behavior or mood.

Important Safety Information

CONTRAVE can cause serious side effects of suicidal thoughts or actions. One of the ingredients in CONTRAVE is bupropion HCl. Bupropion has caused some people to have suicidal thoughts or actions or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking medicines used to treat depression. Bupropion may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. If you already have depression or other mental illnesses, taking bupropion may cause it to get worse, especially within the first few months of treatment.
Stop taking CONTRAVE and call a healthcare provider right away if you, or your family member, have any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying; attempts to commit suicide; depression; anxiety; feeling very agitated or restless; panic attacks; trouble sleeping (insomnia); irritability; acting aggressive, being angry or violent; acting on dangerous impulses; an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania); other unusual changes in behavior or mood.
While taking CONTRAVE, you or your family members should pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings and maintain communication with your healthcare provider. CONTRAVE has not been studied in and is not approved for use in children under the age of 18.

Stacy HenningsSr. Director, Regulatory Affairs Advertising & PromotionsOrexigen Therapeutics, Inc.3344 North Torrey Pines Ct., Ste. 200La Jolla, CA 92037RE: NDA 200063 CONTRAVE (naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl) Extended-Release Tablets MA 301Dear Ms. Hennings:The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed a Direct-to-Consumer broadcast television advertisement (TV ad) entitled “BRAIN BOR WOMAN’S DAY: 60” (CON-0303) for CONTRAVE (naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl) Extended-Release Tablets (Contrave) submitted by Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. (Orexigen) under cover of Form FDA 2253. This TV ad makes false or misleading representations about the risks associated with Contrave. Thus, the TV ad misbrands Contrave within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(n); 331(a); 321(n). 21 CFR 202.1(e)(1); 202.1(e)(5). This violation is concerning from a public health perspective because it creates a misleading impression about the safety of Contrave.BackgroundBelow are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks associated with the use of Contrave.1 According to the FDA-approved product labeling (PI) (emphasis original):CONTRAVE is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of:30 kg/m2 or greater (obese) or27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-relatedcomorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ordyslipidemia).Limitations of Use:The effect of CONTRAVE on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been established.The safety and effectiveness of CONTRAVE in combination with other products intended for weight loss, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal preparations, have not been established.This product is associated with a number of serious risks. The PI for the drug contains boxed warnings regarding suicidal thoughts and behaviors and neuropsychiatric reactions.  Contrave is contraindicated in uncontrolled hypertension, seizure disorder or a history of seizures; use of other bupropion-containing products; bulimia or anorexia nervosa, chronic opioid or opiate agonist or partial agonists use, or acute opiate withdrawal; patients undergoing an abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs; concomitant administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors; known allergy to bupropion, naltrexone or any other component of Contrave; and pregnancy. The PI also contains warnings and precautions regarding seizures, patients receiving opioid analgesics, increase in blood pressure and heart rate, allergic reactions, hepatotoxicity, activation of mania, angle-closure glaucoma, and the potential risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes on antidiabetic therapy. In addition, the PI indicates that the most common adverse reactions associated with Contrave are nausea, constipation, headache, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, dry mouth, and diarrhea.False or Misleading Risk PresentationPromotional materials misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to risk. The determination of whether promotional materials are misleading includes, among other things, not only representations made or suggested in promotional materials, but also failure to reveal facts that are material in light of representations made by the materials or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested by the materials. The TV ad is misleading because it includes efficacy claims for Contrave, but fails to include important risk information associated with the drug. For example, the TV ad includes the statement “Do not take with opioids,” but fails to include any of the other conditions for which Contrave is contraindicated. Additionally, the TV ad includes the statement, “CONTRAVE may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teens, and young adults within the first few months,” but fails to disclose any information about neuropsychiatric reactions also discussed in the BOXED WARNING section of the PI for Contrave. We note that the TV ad includes the statements, “CONTRAVE is not for everyone” and “Other side effects may occur.” However, this does not mitigate the omission of these important risks from the TV ad.  By omitting serious risks associated with Contrave, the TV ad misleadingly suggests that Contrave is safer than has been demonstrated.The TV ad is also misleading because it communicates important risk information in the visual portion of the TV ad only, i.e., as SUPERs, and presents unrelated risk information in competing audio messages. For example, the TV ad discloses important risk information regarding the warning and precaution for the potential risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes only as a SUPER, although, television advertisements shall include information relating to the major side effects and contraindications of the advertised drugs in the audio or audio and visual parts of the presentation. 21 CFR 202.1(e)(1). Additionally, the TV ad discloses important risk information about the contraindication for concomitant opioid use in the audio portion of the proposed TV ad simultaneously with a SUPER containing unrelated risk information about the most common adverse reactions. The overall effect of disclosing important risk information in SUPERs only, along with the simultaneous presentation of SUPERs and competing audio messages, undermines the communication of important risk information and thereby misleadingly minimizes the risks associated with the use of Contrave. The presentation in the video is especially problematic from a public health perspective given the serious and potentially life-threatening risks associated with the drug.Conclusion and Requested ActionFor the reasons discussed above, the TV ad misbrands Contrave within the meaning of the FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(n); 331(a); 321(n). 21 CFR 202.1(e)(1); 202.1(e)(5).OPDP requests that Orexigen immediately cease violating the FD&C Act, as discussed above. Please submit a written response to this letter on or before June 2, 2017, stating whether you intend to comply with this request, listing all promotional materials (with the 2253 submission date) for Contrave that contain violations such as those described above, and explaining your plan for discontinuing use of such violative materials.Please direct your response to the undersigned at the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, 5901-B Ammendale Road, Beltsville, Maryland 20705-1266.  A courtesy copy can be sent by facsimile to (301) 847-8444. To ensure timely delivery of your submissions, please use the full address above and include a prominent directional notation (e.g. a sticker) to indicate that the submission is intended for OPDP. Please refer to MA 301 in addition to the NDA number in all future correspondence relating to this particular matter. All correspondence should include a subject line that clearly identifies the submission as a Response to Untitled Letter. OPDP reminds you that only written communications are considered official.The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. It is your responsibility to ensure that your promotional materials for Contrave comply with each applicable requirement of the FD&C Act and FDA implementing regulations.Sincerely,{See appended electronic signature}Meena Ramachandra, PharmDRegulatory Review OfficerDivision of Advertising & Promotion Review 2Office of Prescription Drug Promotion{See appended electronic signature}Melinda McLawhorn, PharmD, BCPS, RACTeam LeaderDivision of Advertising & Promotion Review 2Office of Prescription Drug Promotion DivisionReference ID: 4100080---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/s/----------------------------------------------------MEENA RAMACHANDRA05/18/2017MELINDA W MCLAWHORN05/18/2017_____________________________________________________1 This information is for background purposes only and does not necessarily represent the risk information that should be included in the promotional piece cited in this letter.Reference ID: 4100080

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Important Safety Information

CONTRAVE can cause serious side effects of suicidal thoughts or actions. One of the ingredients in CONTRAVE is bupropion HCl. Bupropion has caused some people to have suicidal thoughts or actions or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking medicines used to treat depression. Bupropion may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. If you already have depression or other mental illnesses, taking bupropion may cause it to get worse, especially within the first few months of treatment.
Stop taking CONTRAVE and call a healthcare provider right away if you, or your family member, have any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying; attempts to commit suicide; depression; anxiety; feeling very agitated or restless; panic attacks; trouble sleeping (insomnia); irritability; acting aggressive, being angry or violent; acting on dangerous impulses; an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania); other unusual changes in behavior or mood.
While taking CONTRAVE, you or your family members should pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings and maintain communication with your healthcare provider. CONTRAVE has not been studied in and is not approved for use in children under the age of 18.
Do not take CONTRAVE if you:

Have or have had an eating disorder called anorexia or bulimia
Are dependent on opioid pain medicines or use medicines to help stop taking opioids such as methadone or buprenorphine, or are in opiate withdrawal
Drink a lot of alcohol and abruptly stop drinking, use medicines called sedatives (these make you sleepy), benzodiazepines, or anti-seizure medicines and you stop using them all of a sudden, as these may increase your chance of having a seizure
Have taken medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including linezolid, within the last 14 days
Are allergic to any of the ingredients in CONTRIVE
Are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant while taking CONTRIVE

Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, especially: depression or other mental illnesses; attempted suicide; seizures; head injury; tumor or infection of your brain or spine; low blood sugar or low levels of sodium; liver or kidney problems; high blood pressure; heart attack, heart problems, or stroke; eating disorder; drinking a lot of alcohol; prescription medicine or street drug abuse; are over the age of 65; diabetes; other medical conditions; breastfeeding.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Do not take any other medicines while you are taking CONTRAVE unless your healthcare provider has said it is okay to take them.
Swallow CONTRAVE tablets whole. Do not cut, chew, or crush CONTRAVE tablets. Tell your healthcare provider if you cannot swallow CONTRAVE tablets whole. Do not take CONTRAVE with high-fat meals. It may increase your risk of seizures. Take CONTRAVE exactly as prescribed.
Possible serious side effects of CONTRAVE:

If you have a seizure, stop taking CONTRAVE, tell your healthcare provider right away, and do not take CONTRAVE again.
If you take opioid medicines, there may be a risk of opioid overdose. You should get emergency medical help right away if you have trouble breathing; become drowsy with slowed breathing; have slow, shallow breathing; or feel faint, dizzy, or confused.
Sudden opioid withdrawal can be severe and may require hospitalization.
Stop taking CONTRAVE and get medical help immediately if you have any of the following signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions: rash, itching, hives, fever, swollen lymph glands, painful sores in your mouth or around your eyes, swelling of your lips or tongue, chest pain, or trouble breathing.
Increases in blood pressure or heart rate may occur.
CONTRAVE can cause liver damage or hepatitis. Stop taking CONTRAVE if you have any of the following symptoms of liver problems: stomach area pain lasting more than a few days, dark urine, yellowing of the whites of your eyes, or tiredness.
Manic episodes can occur. CONTRAVE can cause some people who were manic or depressed in the past to become manic or depressed again.
CONTRAVE can cause visual problems (angle-closure glaucoma). Signs and symptoms may include: eye pain, changes in vision, swelling or redness in or around the eye. Talk with your doctor to find out if you are at risk and to get treatment to prevent it.
Increased risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also take medicines to treat their diabetes (such as insulin or sulfonylureas). You should check your blood sugar before you start and while taking CONTRAVE.

The most common side effects of CONTRAVE include nausea, constipation, headache, vomiting, dizziness, trouble sleeping, dry mouth, and diarrhea.
Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of CONTRAVE.
