Woven Polyester Cord Strapping & Strapping Supplies
Our state-of-the-art woven polyester cord strap is designed to  replace and out-perform steel strapping and bring your operation into the 21st  Century. The benefits of our strong yet gentle polyester strapping include elongation  and stretch abilities which, when combined with the tension memory features, allow  our strapping to behave like a big, Heavy Duty Industrial “rubber band” during  heavy impact.  That makes it easier to  use and less likely to break than steel. Our cord strap is a superior product  with the engineering of America’s finest behind it. This woven polyester strapping  is tougher but safer than the regular steel banding you’re used to, saving  time, energy and headaches for you and your crew.
The Benefits:
              • Stronger
• Safer
  • Easier to Use
  • Tension Memory and Elongation 
  • Will Not Corrode or Stain Cargo
  • Lightweight
• Resistant to Chemicals and Weather Extremes
 
What we’re talking about here is Strapping Products woven  polyester cord strap that is manufactured with 100% High-Tenacity, Industrial-Strength  Polyester Cord Filaments stitched into a weave and embedded with a reinforced  coating. That makes our cord strap a synthetic material that’s stronger than steel  without the rough edges or safety concerns.  Strapping-Products Woven Polyester Cord Straps  are light, flexible and contain no sharp edges. 
Our polyester cord strapping is very easy to handle. Tension is applied using a simple, ratcheting  tensioner and our engineered highest joint efficiency Wire Buckle.Woven Cord Strapping can be applied  and removed by hand in complete safety without extra precautions.
            Strapping-Products Woven Cord Strapping drastically reduces  the risk of injury during tensioning or removal because it is made from 100%  polyester.
What’s the difference between our Composite Strapping and our  Woven Cord Strapping? While both are made from polyester filaments, Composite  Strap consists of polyester filaments in a straight line that are encased in a  polymer. Woven Cord Polyester Strapping, on the other hand, is even stronger because  it has more filaments that are woven together for extra strength and it has an  added stiffening agent in the strap to make it rigid enough for any industrial  uses.
Our polyester Woven Cord Strapping does not damage the  surface of your products. No more dinged corners or chips in delicate products.  It prevents scratches and stains.  These  polyester straps will not corrode or stain your cargo.
In addition, the elongation and elastic memory features of  polyester cords allow Strapping-Product's Woven Cord Strapping to be tensioned  perfectly on any type of surface. The polyester fibers in the woven cord straps  absorb impact forces during transportation, ensuring the integrity of your  cargo without breaking. Woven Cord Strapping even maintains its shape and  tension under rigorous weather conditions. No matter what you’re driving  through, our banding straps are resistant to high temperature, ultraviolet rays  and moisture.
If you want to be safe and secure with your straps, you want  Strapping-Product’s Woven Polyester Straps.

YOU’VE FOUND THE BEST PLACE FOR APPLE WATCH BANDS

 



We at Strapped & Co are Apple Watch owners ourselves. When we first got our watches, we really loved how easy it was to change the entire look of the Apple Watch with different Band. But when we searched the internet for third-party Bands, all we found were cheaply-made, junky straps from China. Apple Watches are expensive and we just didn’t feel comfortable trusting those poor quality straps to keep the watch secure on our wrists. Meanwhile, Bands made by Apple cost hundreds of dollars and were completely out of our price range. So we decided to make our own Bands and created this site to help other Apple Watch enthusiasts build their own collection of Bands in different styles and colors. Since we launched, we have sold more than 100,000 Bands to customers in 44 states and 23 countries. More than 40% of our customers are repeat buyers.

 



Here are just a few reasons why so many customers shop with us (and keep coming back for more!)

 



Happy CustomersFast & Free ShippingPremium Quality60-Day Free Returns1-Year Warranty





We have thousands of happy customers all over the world that trust our Bands to keep their Apple Watches safe and secure on their wrists. Around 40% of our customers are repeat buyers — they buy a few Bands from us and are so impressed with our quality that they keep coming back to buy more! Less than 1 percent of our customers do a return or an exchange — that means 99% are completely happy with their initial purchase. So buy with confidence!

 





All orders are processed in 1 day from warehouses in New York & Chicago. Free shipping in U.S. & Canada (including to PO/APO Boxes, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico). Tracking numbers are emailed to customers. 97% of shipments are delivered within 3 days. We’ve shipped more than 60k Bands to customers in 44 states and 23 countries. For orders outside U.S & Canada, we offer flat rate $9 shipping.

 





Our Bands are made to be durable while still feeling great around your wrist. All Leather Bands are made from Genuine Leather and all Sport Bands are made from custom rubberized-silicone. All Bands are manufactured using the highest-quality precision molding and tooling. All Bands are made using premium dyes so the color will never fade. We perform extensive quality testing on every Band before shipping to guarantee our products are in excellent condition and will lock securely into your Apple Watch. All Bands ship in  a resealable pouch perfect for storage & travel.

 





We offer a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. We are so confident you’ll love our products that we offer 60-Day Free Returns on all orders. You can buy some Bands, try them on at home, and if you don’t love them, you can send them back for free and get a full refund!

 





As part of our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, each Band we ship comes with a 1-Year Warranty that protects against any and all manufacturing defects. Our Bands are made to last and we fully stand behind our products so please do not hesitate to contact us if you face any issues or you’re not 100% satisfied.
