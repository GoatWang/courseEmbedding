Our Story
    














SFG
                    


More than two decades ago, several successful investment advisors, with more than 40 years of aggregate investment advisory experience, joined forces to develop a financial services experience deliberately built from the ground up to achieve their clients’ goals and satisfy their needs.
                      















Clients
                    


They first identified our target clients: successful business owners, highly compensated professionals and executives, and other high net worth families - and analyzed their needs and goals.
                      















Approach
                    


Their conclusions served as the basis for creating a client-centered investment advisory firm that, through its own balanced approach, brings balanced growth to its unique clients.
                      















Industry Leaders
                    


Today, our comprehensive financial services process, relying on the efficient collaboration of our proactive and competent team, continues to serve as the catalyst for the delivery of individualized analysis, expert planning and precise and timely implementation. It has taken years of hard work to move from a solid concept to a recognized industry leader. Our clients deserve nothing less than the best.

	Retirement Plans : Strategic Financial Group







Strategic Financial Group






































Existing Clients 
































RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES

Plan Sponsors
Strategic Financial Group, LLC (“SFG”) provides objective assistance to retirement plans with the design, implementation and monitoring of a reliable documentation process based on prudent oversight and due diligence. Our qualified professionals improve the effectiveness of the retirement plan for owners, managers and other employees, and manage the employer’s liability.
 
 
 
 
 





RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES

Plan Participants
We work with all participants to help guide their long term investment goals, including the definition of investment time-horizon and goals, tolerance for risk and general diversification standards. Equipped with professional guidance, employee participants confidently embrace the importance of consistently saving during their employment to achieve their version of financial success during retirement.
 
 
 
 
 





RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES

Our Advantages
We show up! Year after year, we work directly with participants on an individualized basis and take the time, in a setting that is conducive to elicit frank discussions, to help them understand market movement and the decisions that produce good outcomes.

  More Advantages





×  



Low cost diversified portfolio strategies.
Unbiased investment advice.
Comprehensive fiduciary review process - employer receives from SFG all plan documentation that it is required to have.  


SFG serves as “co-fiduciary” with the employer.
SFG provides a custom website, with employer’s customized branding,      that serves as a timely, efficient, comprehensive and interactive               resource for employee participants and the employer’s HR department.
Employee education - this point is the most important.

RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES

Participant Education
We counsel employees on strategies for successful retirement plan outcomes. Click on the box below for several examples.

  Examples





×  



Efficient market hypothesis is paramount for long term savings success.
Accumulate a mixture of stocks and bonds.
Implement a patient approach that utilizes dollar cost averaging.
Minimize decisions based on short term market fluctuations.
Embrace negative market periods as times of opportunity.
Understand the power of “Compounded Earnings.”
"Compounded Decision Making" - most expensive education materials          and fancy retirement calculators focus on long term goals, but                      employee participants want to know what do this week, this month,       this year and next year with their 401(k) and other financial               challenges.  


Realize the cost and benefits of the “1% per year” concept.
Adopt the excellent habit of increasing contributions by 1% annually.
Find additional $$$ to increase the savings rate.
Identify other financial decisions and programs that will increase       savings.
Take responsibility for retirement.
Make a personal commitment to save and do not expect savings to be       based on the employer’s plan.
Keep in mind that most important financial decisions are made at times       of major life changes.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'

                            about the business.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Taxable Compound Interestback to Strategies and ProductsA 30-year old man has $50,000 in a 6% C.D. in a Roth IRA account at his bank. Assuming he is in a 40% marginal income tax bracket and the C.D. continues to earn the same interest, how much money will the man have at age 65? The man will have $287,175, and if he chooses to cash it in at age 65, he will pay no income taxes because Roth IRA accounts are income tax free.Another 30-year old man has $50,000 in a 6% C.D. in a tax deferred fixed annuity bought at his bank. Assuming he is in a 40% marginal income tax bracket and the C.D. continues to earn the same interest, how much money will the man have at age 65? The man will have $287,175, and if he chooses to cash it in at age 65, he will pay income taxes of $94,870 at that time. Another 30-year old man has $50,000 in a regular C.D. also earning 6% at his bank. He has selected to compound the interest in the account until age 65 without making any withdrawals. Assuming he is in the 40% marginal income tax bracket and the C.D. continues to earn the same interest, how much money will the man have at age 65?Although the three men above have the same amount of money at age 65, their costs to acquire the $287,175 in the account were quite different. 

The man with the Roth IRA faired the best with no income tax costs.  The man with the traditional IRA faired second best when he paid an income tax cost of $94,870. The man with the regular C.D. who compounded his interest had the most cost. While he paid $94,870 in income taxes, they were not paid out in one sum at age 65. Rather, taxes were paid out incrementally each year as the interest was earned. Therefore, one must use the time value of money to calculate true costs. Assuming an after-tax investment rate of 6% for the time value of money purposes, this man loses $94,870 in taxes plus $111,896 in lost earnings on those taxes. In other words, if a person pays income taxes sooner than later, it has a higher cost. The cost of compounding the income taxes paid out over 30 years ($94,870) is actually $206,766 in this example.  One may ask, what if the third man paid the income taxes from the regular CD account each year (netting) instead of compounding the interest? He would have faired better. The man would have $144,465 at age 65, but he would also have avoided the time value of money cost of $206,766 that the man compounding the interest experienced. Therefore, of the four possible ways to accumulate long-term savings, tax free, tax deferred, and netting are all less costly than taxable compound interest. This fact is generally true regardless of the interest rate and tax rate assumptions used. 

The LEAP SYSTEM® may help you eliminate some or all of the financial costs associated with owning a taxable compound interest account while still maintaining its benefits. LEAP uses a unique cash flow money strategy to help accomplish these goals.

Dollar Cost Averagingback to Strategies and ProductsDollar cost averaging is a popular way for people to average out the cost of their investments over time. When prices are high, they buy fewer shares. When prices are lower, they buy more shares. However, one must recognize that a "dollar-cost-averaging" strategy does not, by itself, provide for risk management of the assets against market risk, death, disability or creditor protection. Therefore, one may need to protect the "dollar cost averaging" assets from these potential eroding factors. By using the cash flow money concepts and strategies utilized in the LEAP SYSTEM®, one may build in these most important protection elements.Note: Any periodic investment plan does not assume a profit or protect against losses in declining markets. Dollar cost averaging involves continuous investment in securities regardless of the fluctuation price of such securities. Investors should carefully consider their financial ability to continue their investments during periods of low price levels.

 Dividend/Capital Gain Reinvestingback to Strategies and ProductsDividend and Capital Gain reinvesting is a popular method used by many consumers to build wealth overtime. However, dividend and capital gain reinvestment plans may experience income taxes, lost opportunity cost on those taxes, inflation, estate taxes, and management expenses. When having dividends and capital gains reinvested, consumers should look at strategies to protect those assets from these potential financial erosionary factors. This may be accomplished with little or no-additional-out-of-pocket outlay when using the LEAP SYSTEM® strategies.

 Prepaying a Mortgageback to Strategies and ProductsIt is true that prepaying a mortgage can save loan interest costs over time. What is not widely understood is that this savings may come at the expense of paying more income taxes and experiencing lost opportunity costs on the extra payments which may result in costs greater than the loan interest savings. The estimated total cost to the consumer is rarely explained or calculated by many financial institutions while the interest saved is always shown. Consumers should be careful to obtain a complete and proper analysis before spending their hard earned money on paying down their mortgage faster. The LEAP® process provides helpful information for you to review with your mortgage broker.

Low Deductible on Insuranceback to Strategies and ProductsFor auto, home, health and liability insurance, it is generally recognized as the best strategy in the long-run not to have low deductibles. Since premiums are generally higher for the low deductible coverage, this increased premium cost may result in funding your own insurance coverage in the long run, especially if you do not experience many claims. You should check with your properly licensed casuality broker or insurance carrier to assess the appropriate premium rates for various deductibles on your insurance policies.

 Gifts to Minors  back to Strategies and ProductsLEAP SYSTEMS, Inc. has found that special gifting accounts for minors may not be the best overall strategy for funding college education capital. For the few dollars it may save in income taxes, the restrictions and lost opportunity costs can potentially be significant. Restrictions on the availability of money and the loss of protection against death, disability and future income taxes make this strategy a weaker choice for most consumers than other more productive choices. A program that pays little or no income taxes, maintains control over the assets, potentially keeps the assets out of the hands of creditors, and completes the plan in the event of death or disability would be superior. Consumers should consider all of the alternatives for funding college tuition and other costs before selecting special gifting accounts for minors.The LEAP® process provides a complete and comprehensive approach to college education funding techniques that provide a full range of benefits for consumers.

Tax Deferral Strategies back to Strategies and ProductsThe LEAP® process can show you why, in many cases, a tax-deferral strategy may be ineffective for wealth building and protection opportunities. Tax-deferral strategies may not avoid income taxes, but only postpone them, or actually cause a larger tax later if one's marginal tax bracket increases. One should also consider reducing or avoiding income taxes as an effective financial strategy than just postponing taxes. In addition, many consumers are never provided any information about the potential estate distribution and estate conservation problems of a tax-deferred asset strategy or program.All of the benefits and potential disadvantages of a tax-deferral strategy or product should be evaluated before its implementation. Every consumer needs to review other alternatves with the same outlay before allocating any dollars to a tax-deferral program. It may be that a tax-deferral program makes sense and is the best alternative, but until a comparison with a fully intergated program is provided, one may not come to the conclusion that a tax-deferred program is always best.

Buy Term and Invest the Difference back to Strategies and ProductsTerm life insurance plays an important role in protecting individuals, businesses and families from the premature death of a breadwinner or key person. In many instances, term life insurance is chosen because of its apparent low cost. Like most things in life, if something is low cost, there usually is a reason. Contrary to the public understanding, a long-term strategy of "buy term and invest the difference" can have significant costs to the insured and the ultimate beneficiaries.The LEAP SYSTEM® helps consumers understand that term life premiums and its lost opportunity cost can be very expensive over the life expectancy of any consumer who employs such a strategy. The potential loss of the death benefit of the term life policy may leave the invested difference account vulnerable to income taxes, estate taxes, market declines, and liquidity problems.Although term life insurance plays an important role in many financial situations, one must consider all of the factors associated with the cost of the premiums over time, the potential loss of the earnings on those premiums, and the ultimate possible loss of the death benefit. If the term life policy has expired and the stock market is perhaps in a downward cycle at the time of the ultimate death, the effects of this strategy can be financially damaging to heirs.For a more complete understanding of this subject, this approach educates consumers on all aspects of various forms of life insurance coverages. No particular type of policy is uniformly the best in all circumstances. Each type of insurance policy must be evaluated and selected in an appropriate evaluation process such as the LEAP SYSTEM.

Series E/EE Bonds back to Strategies and ProductsThe safety and tradition behind these financial products has played an important part of America's growth and development. The payroll deduction of Series E/EE Bonds by employees in corporate America has been a popular way to forced savings for the future. No one can deny the value these bonds have contributed to many Americans over the years. For certain investors, these bonds have great appeal.There are features of these financial products that need explanation for the overall understanding. These financial instruments earn what is called "phantom income," that is, they accrue interest rather than currently paying it out. The consumers' inability to use this income or interest during the bond holding period prevents the use of the interest for other financial needs, wants and desires that they may have. Therefore, one may lose the opportunity to build additional wealth or protect those assets from eroding factors.Money that is idle may be less productive than money that is being used for other financial needs and objectives. One should assess the advantage of receiving a benefit from one financial product and weigh it against the loss of benefits that may be derived from an alternative product before making a final decision in this area.

Non-matched IRA or 401(k)back to Strategies and ProductsIndividual Retirement Accounts (IRA) and 401(k)'s are used to save money for retirement. They are one of the most powerful tools in the financial arsenal for this purpose. Unfortunately, at the same time many people overlook the disadvantages and fail to protect their hard earned money. LEAP SYSTEMS, Inc. explains that for many Americans, these tax-deferred strategies may contain problems due to their inability to prevent eventual large income tax payments, estate taxes, and potential losses due to market fluctuation.Since these accounts are usually long-term in nature, inflation, market fluctuation, and taxation can significantly reduce the purchasing value of the accounts. Americans may lose considerable amounts of their account values because they may not have been made aware of the possible economic dangers both before and after retirement or death.In order to be most effective, these accounts need to be properly structured and coordinated and integrated with other financial strategies and products in order to protect them. Otherwise, the accounts will always be vulnerable to possible losses. One must make sure that their retirement nest egg is safe and secure since this is the money one must live on throughout the remainder of the years. The LEAP SYSTEM® provides consumers with 401(k) plans a way in which to protect the assets from many different types of erosion, while at the same time providing a balanced retirement outlook.

 15-Year Mortgages back to Strategies and ProductsWhy do banks usually charge less interest for a 15-year mortgage than for a 30-year mortgage? Is one mortgage cheaper than another? Actually, they may be identical in cost. In order to get the cheaper loan interest rate, you have to pay a higher premium for the monthly payment. If one took the difference in the payment and invested it into an IRA, Roth IRA, paid off credit cards, or put it into a guaranteed annuity; there is a good chance that they would have more money at the end of the 15-year period. No guarantees of course, but one needs to consider the alternatives.For a large percentage of American consumers, the net cost of a 15-year mortgage is greater than a 30-year mortgage given similar or even lower interest rates. Although one can save actual interest costs with a 15-year mortgage, after considering the income taxes paid and the lost opportunity costs on the invested difference in monthly payments, a 30-year mortgage may actually be cheaper in the long run.A 30-year mortgage may still be paid off in 15-years, and potentially still have more money left over compared to a 15-year mortgage, if the difference in monthly payments had actually been faithfully saved in a conservative alternative. In addition, the lower monthly payments of a 30-year mortgage versus the higher monthly payments of a 15-year mortgage may provide the consumer with more safety in the event of loss of job, a declining real estate market, or for any other unforeseen expenses that may come along that need to be made.The LEAP SYSTEM® provides consumers with information that can be helpful to make intelligent decisions when talking to their banker or mortgage broker.

Credit Card Debt back to Strategies and ProductsHigh non-deductible interest costs makes using credit cards for loans a serious wealth eroder. There is no doubt that in our fast paced society, credit cards are a convenience to use, but they should be avoided for borrowing large sums of money over a long periods of time whenever possible.Before using your credit card for major loan purposes, consider using other sources of loans such as a home equity loan, a life insurance policy loan, or a personal family loan. These sources are far superior to credit card debt. When using credit cards for loans, you are also paying for people who don't pay since it is built into the loan interest rate.
The LEAP SYSTEM® has a cash flow management system that can assist consumers to save and lower expenses if needed at all.

10-Year or 20-Year Term Life Policies back to Strategies and ProductsThese specific term life policies are designed to provide insurance coverage for a period of 10 or 20 years. In many cases, they serve as the best protection for beneficiaries in the event of a premature death to the insured. Although term life insurance policies have a low premium in the early years, at older ages the premiums increase and can become very expensive and in some cases prohibitive. When term life insurance policies expire or are cancelled, their overall cost to the insured and beneficiaries is made up of the following factors: 

total premiums paid plus the potential earnings lost on the premium payments plus the loss of the death benefit and any estate assets lost to taxes or other eroding factors brought about by one's death 

The LEAP® process provides fair and balanced comparisons as to the actual overall costs of term life insurance policies. Make sure you completely understand the total costs associated with term life insurance policies, especially in the long run before making any long-term decisions in your insurance portfolio. See our complete explanation below.Click here for a complete presentation on this product

Long-Term Investing back to Strategies and ProductsMany sales people, writers, and investment companies claim that one should buy and hold investments for the long-term. However, not every investment product works effectively the longer one holds it given equal rates of return assumptions. The potential management fees, income taxes, lost opportunity costs, inflation, and estate taxes can substantially reduce or negate much of the growth some investments create in the long run. These facts may necessitate the use of other cash flow techniques in the planning process in order to protect any investments from these potential eroding factors. Most investments have choices as to what to do with dividends, capital gains, and interest. The LEAP SYSTEM® can show you how to coordinate and integrate these choices to help protect the investments from income taxes, estate taxes, creditors, and other eroding factors.Note: Investments involve market risk, including fluctuating returns and possible loss of principal.

 Survivorship Life Insuranceback to Strategies and ProductsSurvivorship life insurance is a product used mostly for estate tax planning purposes. Where estates are large but illiquid, this financial tool can be effective for raising necessary funds to conserve the estate from taxation. Many attorneys and CPA's recommend this type product for the estate tax purpose and usually recommend that it be placed into an irrevocable life insurance trust. Survivorship life works best for ages 65 and over.However, for ages 65 and over, survivorship life insurance may have some serious consequences for the insured and their heirs that sometimes get overlooked. One such risk is whereby one spouse lives to or beyond life expectancy. Since the policy doesn't pay until the second of the spouses to die, such a long time frame may reduce the advantage of the death benefit as an effective way to pay the estate tax.A more serious consequence may occur when one spouse dies at an early age (example age 50) and the other spouse lives to an old age (example age 90). The loss of not paying a death benefit on the first spouse's death has a large lost opportunity cost to the eventual heirs. In either of the two cases just mentioned, a significant portion of the estate assets may be lost for the heirs. These losses occur because the future value of the premium payments and/or death benefits not paid out at the first death may be equal to or greater than the value of the death benefit. These costs should always be explained and clearly calculated to consumers before considering survivorship life insurance as an estate planning strategy.The LEAP® process offers consumers many choices in the selection of a well-designed estate plan. We seek to build a plan that will work under almost any scenario, and not just a few. Only a fair and balanced analysis can provide such a complete appraisal to select the most appropriate estate-planning tool.

Low Yield Savings Account   The combination of income taxes, lost opportunity cost on taxes, and inflation can negate or offset the interest earnings one accrues on low yield savings accounts in the long run. These accounts should primarily be used for short-term liquidity and convenience. The LEAP SYSTEM® can help you select other more appropriate savings vehicles or insurance products for your long term savings needs that can potentially lower your income taxes, avoid lost opportunity costs and combat inflation.Note: Bank deposits are FDIC-insured, while other investment vehicles are not FDIC- insured.
