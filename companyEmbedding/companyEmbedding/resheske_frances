Frances Resheske
Senior vice president of public affairs, Con Edison
Frances Resheke
When Frances Resheske was young, she wanted to be president.
“I always grew up wanting to run for office, which is not something I’m interested in doing at this point,” Resheske said. “When I was a little girl, I actually told my teacher I wanted to be the first woman president.”
Her career has followed a different path, but one still situated firmly in the public sphere.
She meets regularly with federal, state and city officials to advocate for lower taxes on utility bills and other company goals. She oversees how Con Ed communicates with customers about service outages—a challenging aspect of her work. Resheske also manages Con Ed’s support of 1,000 nonprofit organizations and coordinates the company’s volunteer efforts, from painting roofs to mentoring children.
And in her spare time, she serves on nine boards—as well as being in her 15th year heading the Queens Theatre in the Park, which keeps her connected to the borough where she grew up. She landed in the energy world by chance, jumping from the outgoing Koch administration in 1989 to Brooklyn Union, a gas company where she planned to “go and think about what to do with my life.”
But the industry, which had just been deregulated, fascinated her. She moved up the ranks, and in 1999 she was recruited to Con Edison.
“I had no idea how involved utilities were in the life of the city,” she said. “I felt that energy is a vital part in our economy, so that we’re doing something important every day, from the business perspective.”
How did you get your start?
I got a job working for Mayor Ed Koch, and I represented him in Queens in the communityassistance unit, and I stayed with the Koch administration through the end in 1989. I credit that administration with a lot of my career, because I was very young, and he had really, really smart, capable people that worked for him and advised him.
On balance, has being a woman helped or hurt?
I don’t think either. When you work for an elected official, it doesn’t matter what you are. You need to win, and you need to advocate for positions. When I went to the utilities, to Brooklyn Union in 1990, I was very often the only woman in the room. It’s not that way here. This company has always been very progressive with women.
What is the worst advice anyone ever gave you?
I’m a big believer in listening. I think when you listen you get lots of advice and lots of tips and lots of information, and there’s probably something worthwhile in all of it, to varying degrees.
