APTN BRAND REFRESH
The Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) wanted to refresh their on-air branding to present a more modern, global presence. With direction from Craig Kirkham, we began with research and interviews, then a comprehensive brand identity exercise which showed what made APTN a unique broadcaster: their perspective. Through award-winning investigative journalism and original storytelling they presented a different way of looking at the world. We began with a simple tagline Stories only we can tell. We then designed a shape—a trapezoid—to symbolize an alternate view, then broke it down into own-able, defining colours and shapes that created an approachable, stylized feel for the master brand. We then updated their logo to be seen clearly across multiple platforms and devices. Bold colours, distinct lines and signature animations brought their formerly disparate shows and on-air branding together to form a strong, cohesive network identity.

IMAN Cosmetics
IMAN Cosmetics wanted beautiful video content. What they got, instead, was a beautifully produced video and also a strategic long term content strategy – a plan that revolved around creating the video in 3D. This approach meant that we would be able to access multiple angles of the product – in fact, we could look at it, and even manipulate it, from every conceivable angle imaginable. And these visual assets could be further repurposed, used to build an asset library for the client, empowering them to build even more content for future initiatives; a vital capability in an increasingly content-driven world.

The Rock Re-brand
Our re-brand for Toronto’s professional lacrosse team, The Toronto Rock, included the design and development of everything from The Rock’s posters and season tickets to its web presence and commercial campaign. Our approach to the project included an artful mix of live-action video and photos featuring the team’s top stars – a dramatic, swaggering, of-the-moment aesthetic that served to elevate The Rock’s status and help re-position them alongside the city’s iconic sports teams.
