 Johnny Southpaw McGrath used to be a happy, ordinary teenager living in a rural Mississippi town called Goonberry Gulch. He went to school, church, had a girlfriend and, most importantly, he played baseball. Then things went terribly wrong . . . With his father missing on the battlefields of Europe, his mother dead from cancer, and the bank days away from foreclosing on the family farm, Johnny finds himself destined for an orphanage. Unable to accept his father is dead, and refusing to go to the orphanage, Johnny flees into the woods, where the voice of an old man lures him to an abandoned farm. Here he meets Charles Haddes, a fly-laden spirit with an unbelievable story about a town just a mere two day walk thru the Goonberry Gulch Woods, a town not on any map, a town inhabited by the walking dead. " . . . if yuh wanna know about yer Pa, yuh gotta go up to Limbo. Pray that he ain't there, but look anyways. If yuh don't see him, then yuh ain't no orphan. If yuh do see him, than at least yuh'll know . . . "

Description

                    Society is crumbling before Jake McCluskie's eyes. A desperate tension fills the streets as frightened people attempt to flee. The clock is ticking down to zero, but Jake has already lost all hope. As an extinction-class meteorite rockets toward Earth, Jake knows the end is near. But he is going nowhere-or so he thinks. Jake, a one-time promising author and now full-time bus driver, is still grieving and angry after the murder of his wife three years ago. Although he has chosen to live out his last days at home with his cat, Jake soon learns destiny has other plans for him. He has been chosen to fix time-and it is no easy repair. With crazed killers lurking everywhere, Jake embarks on a heart-pounding race through the empty streets of Queens, New York, in search of the Timekeeper-the only one who can send him back to September of 1938, when a college student important to the flow of time was brutally murdered during a violent hurricane. Now only time will tell if Jake can survive long enough to get there. In this science fiction thriller, it is up to one man to find the Timekeeper and set things right before mankind disappears forever.show more

Overview



Society is crumbling before Jake McCluskie's eyes. A desperate tension fills the streets as frightened people attempt to flee. The clock is ticking down to zero, but Jake has already lost all hope. As an extinction-class meteorite rockets toward Earth, Jake knows the end is near. But he is going nowhere-or so he thinks. Jake, a one-time promising author and now full-time bus driver, is still grieving and angry after the murder of his wife three years ago. Although he has chosen to live out his last days at home with his cat, Jake soon learns destiny has other plans for him. He has been chosen to fix time-and it is no easy repair. With crazed killers lurking everywhere, Jake embarks on a heart-pounding race through the empty streets of Queens, New York, in search of the Timekeeper-the only one who can send him back to September of 1938, when a college student important to the flow of time was brutally murdered during a violent hurricane. Now only time will tell if Jake can survive long enough to get there.In this science fiction thriller, it is up to one man to find the Timekeeper and set things right before mankind disappears forever.

 ISBN: 978-1-4759-5687-0 
  Chapter One  pop goes the planet    Society was breaking down before my eyes.    Everywhere you looked there were scared people. They were  on the sidewalks, in the gutters, in the streets, going this way  and that, back and forth like drunken ants, rolling suitcases, carrying  knapsacks, and lugging boxes and bags filled with worldly possessions.  They were fleeing from something that you couldn't flee from, but hope  kept them moving anyway.    I was all out of hope and had been for a while. I was also out of faith.  The clock was ticking down to zero, and I knew it.    I watched the chaotic madness from the corner of Hillside Avenue and  130th Street in the Kew Gardens district of Queens. Everyone's movements  blended together into a colorful, scary blur, and I felt my sanity tug away  from me. Then I thought of the train, and my heart rate sped up.    Train service was spotty at best now, though the gruff old guy taking  tickets this afternoon when I left for the cemetery promised me that there  would definitely be a 4:45 train. If I missed that one, well, I might be out  of luck. And I didn't want to be out of luck. Not today. I didn't want to  have to walk back to Rockaway through all this hysteria.    It was starting to drizzle lightly now. A huge mass of menacing gray  clouds cast a gloomy pallor over the panicked masses, and I feared it was  going to turn into something worse. I had no umbrella or raincoat. I hadn't  even thought about the weather today. It just didn't seem important. But  now it did. And I wasn't dressed for the rain.    I wore a gray, hooded sweat top to ward off the mid-September chill;  now that it was raining, I pulled the hood up over my head. I then fished out  my cell phone from my pocket. It was just after four in the afternoon. I had  five blocks to cover, so I knew I had plenty of time to make the train. Still,  a sense of urgency pumped through me, and I started walking faster.    Blocking out as much of the crying, screaming, and sharp, desperate  yelps surrounding me as I could, I trudged down Hillside Avenue, my feet  plowing through ankle-deep trash. Garbage collection had been one of the  first things to stop, and it looked like this part of Queens had sprouted  up in the city dump. Black garbage bags were piled up along the sidewalk  and in the gutters. A lot of the bags had been ripped open by stray dogs or  rats or people looking for food, and the wind had taken the garbage and  had blown it everywhere, so in certain spots you couldn't avoid trudging  through it.    Eerie tendrils of gray smoke drifted aimlessly through the street.  Something close by was on fire, and maybe it was a blessing that it was  raining because, like the trash collectors, the firemen were long gone,  too. In fact, nearly every service had been suspended until further notice.  Everyone was on their own now. Well, almost.    The National Guard had moved in at the beginning of the week to  oversee the evacuation and police the area. It was a shame there was no  one around to police them. I had heard horror stories about what they were  doing. Shooting looters was one thing; shooting dogs and innocent people  was something else entirely.    I hadn't seen too many of them today. I would probably see fewer now  that it was raining. And as I was thinking about that, happy now that it  was raining, I spotted an olive-green army uniform in the chaotic rush of  people. But it wasn't a soldier, at least not from this era, but rather an old  man ... and I knew him.    Though I had a train to catch, I knew I had to intervene. For if I didn't,  something terrible would happen to this man, and if something terrible  happened to him because I had ignored the situation, I wouldn't be able  to live with myself—not even for the last five days of my life.    I hurried toward him, weaving in and out of evacuees who, thankfully,  seemed too preoccupied with their own troubles to worry about me, and  ran right up to him as he stood in the middle of the street. He didn't see me  because he was too busy looking at the moving crowd. He was obviously  searching for someone, and a sick feeling grew in the pit of my gut as I  guessed who that someone was.    "General? General? Are you okay? Where's your wife?"    He didn't hear a word I said and continued to search the crowd. His real  name was Harold Graves, but I called him General because he had been a  career soldier and still preferred a military distinction. Granted, referring  to him as a general was stretching things a bit, considering that during his  military career he only managed to reach the lofty rank of sergeant. Still, be  it sergeant or general, the old guy was in his eighties and, though he didn't  know it, suffering from dementia. Some days he knew what was going on;  some days he didn't. His medication helped—a bit, anyway.    He was dressed for the part: green army fatigues, probably from his  Vietnam days. His boot laces were tied sloppily. It meant his wife hadn't  tied them.    I caught his attention, drawing close to him, and his eyes lit up with  recognition. He straightened up, inching the strap on his rifle farther up  on his shoulder, and smiled around his loose-fitting dentures before crisply  saluting me.    I pulled down my hood, ran a hand across my head to sweep up my  buzz cut, and returned his salute. "What are you doing out here, General?  And where is your wife?"    He ignored my questions. "Good to see you, Captain Jake," he said,  all businesslike. "Are you driving the handicapped bus today?"    I shook my head. "I just walked down from the cemetery. I was visiting  my wife."    A look of sorrow crossed his face. "Sorry about that," he muttered  weakly. Then, in a stronger voice, he added, "So that means you don't have  the bus?"    "Correct, General. The military confiscated all the buses for the  evacuation. So I'm on foot."    "That's too bad. The bus would have come in handy. We could have  used it to search the neighborhood."    A lump of hot fear bottomed out in my gut. "Please tell me your wife  isn't missing."    "Margery? Missing? Naw." And he shook his head. "That old coot is  like a lucky penny—she always turns up."    I had a good five inches on him. He was about five six or seven at  the most; age, gravity, and that damn heavy rifle were making him stoop  slightly, so he was even shorter now. His Afro, covered partly by a well-worn  moss-green cloth patrol cap, was cut close to the scalp and graying  at the temples. His dark face was heavily wrinkled as though he'd worried  a lot in his life. Today he was unshaved. Another discouraging sight, for it  meant his wife had not seen to it.    "General, where is your wife?" I asked pointedly.    He shrugged his brows. "At home, I guess."    I sighed. "Okay, great. She's safe. Now what are you doing out here?"    "Defending the country."    "From what? Wormwood?"    "The Nazis."    I raised a brow at him. "Nazis, huh? Are you sure?"    "Yes, I'm sure," he snapped, exasperated.    "Don't be angry. I just never expected the Nazis to rise up again."    "Well, in truth, it's only one Nazi. From what I understand, he's  lurking around in this neighborhood looking to kill someone. Talk on the  street is that someone is the archangel Gabriel."    "Angel, huh?" I muttered, thinking, Why me? And why now? "So let me  get this straight, there's a Nazi trying to kill an angel. Right?"    "Captain Jake, I'm not as senile as you may think," he grumbled.  "From what I hear, the Nazi is an SS scoundrel. And he's a giant—almost  seven feet. He's driving an old black Thunderbird from the late fifties with  a swastika painted on the hood."    "You don't say," I said, shaking my head slowly as I envisioned that.  "Well, I haven't seen any cars like that around here. Nor have I seen any  Nazis or angels. Are you sure you're not mistaken?"    His expression hardened, and he looked me square in the eye. "I can  tell by your tone, Captain, that you think I'm crazy, but trust me—I'm  not."    "I don't think you're crazy at all, General. It's just that—"    "It's too unbelievable to be believed?" he questioned. "Well, I thought  the same way ... until I laid eyes on the SOB."    "You've seen this guy?"    He pointed off down the road. "Once, from a distance."    "From a distance, huh?"    "I may be old but, like yours, my eyesight is perfect. I know what I  saw."    "Yeah, I'm sure your eyes are great," I returned. "Listen, General, I  don't think it's wise for you to be out here." I motioned at the bedlam  around us. "There's a lot going on. And there are a lot of people. And  maybe you shouldn't be carrying a rifle."    "The Nazi is armed. Why shouldn't I be?"    "'Cuz the army is shooting people carrying guns. I don't want you  getting hurt."    "I won't get hurt. And if I do? Well, who cares? I'm an old man. But  old or not, I've sworn an oath to defend and protect this country."    "General, you swore that oath back in the 1960s when you were  fighting the Vietnamese."    "It still counts today," he shot back with annoyance.    "Maybe so. But you're retired. Better to let the younger soldiers  handle it."    "They're too busy screwing up this evacuation to go Nazi hunting."  And then he leaned closer to me and stage-whispered, "Do you know  they're shooting dogs?"    I nodded solemnly. "Yeah, I heard they were killing strays."    "They're shooting anything on four legs," he said cryptically, shaking  his head slightly. "That just ain't right. It just ain't right at all."    "I know."    "And I've heard they're shooting innocent people, too."    I bowed my head and sighed. "I know."    "A helicopter crashed into an apartment building over on Liberty  Avenue last night, and I watched it burn to the ground. Dozens of families  were trapped inside that building." He heaved a mournful sigh. "The  soldiers stood around and watched it burn. They did nothing to help."    Not knowing what to say, I shrugged and muttered, "We are living  in bad times."    "I'll say," he grumbled, shaking his head sadly. "We've got a Nazi on  the loose and this damn space rock to contend with." He raised a brow at  me. "Think it'll miss?"    I glanced skyward for a second. "It might. We'll find out tonight."    "My gut says the nukes won't work."    I shrugged. "Remember, the nukes don't have to blow it up. They just  have to push it enough so it misses the planet."    "I know, but I don't think it'll work," he said dismally. Then, in a  brighter voice, he added, "But do you wanna hear something weird? My  gut says we still have a chance on this one. Something or someone—I don't  know which—will save us. Strange, huh?"    Actually, I had a similar feeling but had brushed it off as nothing  more than pangs of denial. But now I wasn't so sure, for the feelings were  growing stronger.    "Maybe that's why the archangel Gabriel is around."    "Uh, yeah, maybe. Listen, General, You should get home. Your wife  will be worried."    "I'll be home eventually," he replied. "'Sides, she ain't herself these  days on account of that space rock. Been reading the Bible a lot more." He  eyed me sharply. "Did you know that this thing that's coming at us, this  Wormwood, is from the Bible? A prophecy from the Revelation?"    "I heard," I said, nodding. "It's the sign of the apocalypse."    "Apocalypse, my ass. It'll take more than a space rock to wipe us out.  I think the real sign of the apocalypse, Captain, is that we've got another  infestation of Nazis."    "I thought you said it was just one big guy in an old car?"    "Captain Jake, Nazis are like roaches. When you see one, you have  to step on it quickly. 'Cuz if you don't, you'll be up to your armpits in  them."    "I think I should take you home."    "I don't wanna go home."    "Have you taken your medication?" I asked.    "Medication is for sissies."    "Still, it might be a good idea to take it. And you know what else  might be a good idea? Might be good for you and your wife to go to an  evacuation center. From what I understand, there will be buses leaving for  Canada all night."    "Too cold in Canada."    "Dress warmly."    "I don't wanna go." He shook his head sternly. "I've got a country to  protect. And a Nazi to catch."    "General, let Wormwood take care of the Nazi. Okay?" Then, with  a shrug, I added, "Who knows? Maybe you'll be able to find a few Nazis  in Canada."    "Naw. There's no Nazis in Canada. It's too damn cold up there."    "Maybe so, but I still think you should go."    He eyed me sharply. "What about you, Captain? When are you  leaving?"    "I'm not."    He looked mildly surprised. "The evacuation is mandatory, you  know?"    "I don't care," I said, and shrugged. "I've heard rumors that military  desertions have skyrocketed. So I doubt there will be anyone left around  here in a few days to enforce the order."    He nodded. "I've heard the same rumor. And I'm glad you're gonna  stay put."    "Well, I've got nowhere to go and no one to go with. Besides, I don't  like the cold either. Plus, Estelle—you know her, right?—well, she told  me she isn't leaving either, so I plan to take her for her dialysis treatment  on Monday."    "I thought you said the army confiscated all the buses."    I grinned.    "Did you do something to the bus, Captain Jake?"    "Let's just say I hope the army mechanics aren't too thorough."    His dark eyes glinted with cunning admiration. "Captain Jake, you  are a resourceful character."    "A lot will depend on how good the army mechanics are."    "Whatever happens, I'm damn happy that you're staying put. I can use  the company, and the help."    "Listen General, why don't I walk you home? I know you live only a  couple of blocks from here."    He thought about it for a moment. "Well, might be a good idea to  check in on Margery. Just to see how she's feeling."    He turned then and skipped away from me. The crowd swallowed  him up at once, and I yelled out to him, pleading for him to wait and  come back. His hearing was not the best, and probably most of my words  just got lost in the clamor of the evacuees. I fought my way through the  crowd, looking everywhere for him—and that's when I spotted someone  else whom I recognized.    I stopped abruptly and stared. Could it really be him?    I couldn't see him well; he was looking away; and there were people  crossing my line of sight    He wore a blue suit and ... hey, wait a minute, who wears a suit to an  evacuation?    Something wasn't right. And this guy was acting like the General,  looking every which way, definitely searching for someone. And I didn't  think he was looking for a Nazi, or an angel.    Then he turned, and I saw him clearly.    And my heart nearly stopped.     Chapter Two  my suburban nightmare     I had last seen Fischer Strickland three years ago. At the time, the  son of a bitch was being dragged away in handcuffs after receiving  a life sentence for murdering my wife. As the bailiffs carried the  kicking and screaming murderer from the courtroom, I had felt a great  sense of relief in knowing that he had been flushed from society and that  I would never see him again. Or so I thought.    Well, surprise, surprise, he stood about ten feet away, smoking a  cigarette as though he hadn't a care in the world, all the while searching  the crowd. He still hadn't spotted me, and all I could do was stare at him,  unable to believe it was really him.    He hadn't changed any in three years. He looked just like I remembered  him. His head was long and narrow, like an exclamation point, and his hair  was shoulder length. He was clean-shaven. His cheeks were pockmarked  with acne scars. A doughnut ring of flab hung from his weak chin.    He was better dressed than I was and looked to be wearing the same  navy blue suit and red tie he had worn at his murder trial.    The first initial wave of shock that tore through me subsided like a  breaking wave, and my stomach filled with panic. What the hell am I gonna do?   The National Guard was the law in these parts now, so if I had a  problem I had to go to them. Problem was they were way too busy trying to  keep society from crumbling around us to worry about an escaped convict.  No doubt they'd just tell me to get on a bus and shut up.    So what could I do?    The answer was easy—nothing. I was powerless to do anything, and  standing here looking at him was only making things worse for me. I had to  get away from him. I had to get to the train, and as I went to hurry by him,  he casually turned in my direction as he tossed away the last of his smoke. For  a few seconds—seconds that felt like an eternity—we stared at each other.   (Continues...)     Excerpted from Broken Time by Douglas J. McGregor  Copyright © 2012   by Douglas J. McGregor.
