Biography and early political career[edit]
Huttle was born in 1956 to Anthony P. and Natalie Vainieri. Her family founded the Vainieri Funeral Home in North Bergen;[2] in addition, her father served on the North Bergen Board of Commissioners and one term in the General Assembly from the 32nd District from 1983 to 1985. Her brother Anthony P. Vainieri, Jr. is currently serving on the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders.[3] She is a state-licensed funeral director and has served as president of the funeral home since 1981.[4]
Huttle graduated cum laude from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1980 with a B.A. in English, and received state certification for teaching. She also attended Rider University, but did not receive a degree.[1] Huttle is a former member of the Board of Palisades General Hospital and founder of the Southern Bergen County Homeowners Association. She is also a co-founder of “WIN”, Women Involved Now, an educational and social network for women in the community. Huttle sits on the Board of Trustees as Vice-President of Shelter Our Sisters, an organization that brings awareness to the plight of victims of domestic violence while providing hope and revitalization to their lives through counseling and direct care. She has served as a former Trustee of Vantage Health.[4]
While a resident of Cliffside Park, Huttle mounted a bid for the New Jersey Senate in 1997 in the 38th District against Republican incumbent Louis F. Kosco. Despite raising more funds in the campaign than Kosco, she was defeated by him the general election 55% to 42%.[5][6] Three years later in 2000, by now a resident of Englewood, she and running mate Jack Alter (who was also the mayor of Fort Lee) defeated Republican incumbent Bergen County Freeholders Richard Mola and J. William Van Dyke.[7] Two years later on January 2, 2003, she was unanimously chosen by her peers to serve the Board as the first ever Chairwoman under its present County Executive form of government. Her colleagues returned her to the Chairperson's seat once again in 2004.[1][4]
As Freeholder, Huttle sat on the Community Oversight Board at Bergen Regional Medical Center during her first two years of service, providing oversight of the privately managed county hospital. She has also served on the county Board of Social Services and is a member of the Community Action Partnership Board of Trustees for the last four years where she worked for development of a one-stop homeless shelter to better address the needs of that growing population. She was a member of the Board of School Estimate at the Bergen County Technical Schools, a former member of the Board of School Estimate at Bergen Community College and chaired the Freeholder committee for Health and Human Services.[4] After serving one year as both an Assemblywoman and Freeholder, she declined to seek re-election in 2006 to the Freeholder board.[8]
Huttle is a resident of Englewood, where she lives with her husband Frank Huttle III and their two daughters, Alexandra and Francesca. Frank Huttle has served as Mayor of Englewood since January 2010, succeeding Michael Wildes.[9] Huttle and her husband were inducted into the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem in ceremonies held in September 2000 at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City, having been recommended for the honor by Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Archbishop Edward Egan designated Mrs. Huttle a Dame and Mr. Huttle a Knight of the order.[4]
Legislative career[edit]
After the resignation of District 37 State Senator Byron Baer on September 8, 2005, Huttle had put her name in the ring to fill the Senate vacancy. Ultimately, she withdrew and endorsed Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg of Teaneck to fill the seat. On October 5, after an extended legal battle related to inclusion of five disputed ballots, Weinberg was ultimately victorious over Hackensack Police Chief Ken Zisa in her bid to replace Baer, both on an interim basis and on the November General Election ballot.[10]
With Weinberg's court victory, Huttle and Englewood Mayor Michael Wildes both announced their candidacy for Weinberg's Assembly slot on the November general election ballot and to fill the balance of her term in the Assembly once she took her seat in the Senate. The choice was decided by yet another special convention of the Bergen County Democratic Committee on October 6, 2005, with Huttle out-polling Wildes 121-96 (Huttle would ultimately not serve the remainder of Weinberg's term).[11] Running together with Weinberg and incumbent Assemblyman Gordon M. Johnson, Huttle was elected on Election Day, November 8, 2005, to the Assembly and sworn in as a new member on January 10, 2006, the first day of the 212th Legislative Session.
As of 2015[update], Huttle chairs the Assembly Human Services Committee and sits on the Tourism, Gaming and the Arts Committee and the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation investigating the Fort Lee lane closure scandal. Since 2015, she has served as a Deputy Speaker.[1]
District 37[edit]
Each of the forty districts in the New Jersey Legislature has one representative in the New Jersey Senate and two members in the New Jersey General Assembly. The other representatives from the 37th District for the 2014-2015 Legislative Session are:

Senator Loretta Weinberg
Assemblyman Gordon M. Johnson

Despite raising more funds in the campaign than Kosco, she was defeated by him the general election 55% to 42%.[5][6] Three years later in 2000, by now a resident of Englewood, she and running mate Jack Alter (who was also the mayor of Fort Lee) defeated Republican incumbent Bergen County Freeholders Richard Mola and J. William Van Dyke.[7] Two years later on January 2, 2003, she was unanimously chosen by her peers to serve the Board as the first ever Chairwoman under its present County Executive form of government. Her colleagues returned her to the Chairperson's seat once again in 2004.[1][4]
As Freeholder, Huttle sat on the Community Oversight Board at Bergen Regional Medical Center during her first two years of service, providing oversight of the privately managed county hospital. She has also served on the county Board of Social Services and is a member of the Community Action Partnership Board of Trustees for the last four years where she worked for development of a one-stop homeless shelter to better address the needs of that growing population. She was a member of the Board of School Estimate at the Bergen County Technical Schools, a former member of the Board of School Estimate at Bergen Community College and chaired the Freeholder committee for Health and Human Services.[4] After serving one year as both an Assemblywoman and Freeholder, she declined to seek re-election in 2006 to the Freeholder board.[8]
Huttle is a resident of Englewood, where she lives with her husband Frank Huttle III and their two daughters, Alexandra and Francesca. Frank Huttle has served as Mayor of Englewood since January 2010, succeeding Michael Wildes.[9] Huttle and her husband were inducted into the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem in ceremonies held in September 2000 at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City, having been recommended for the honor by Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Archbishop Edward Egan designated Mrs. Huttle a Dame and Mr. Huttle a Knight of the order.[4]
Legislative career[edit]
After the resignation of District 37 State Senator Byron Baer on September 8, 2005, Huttle had put her name in the ring to fill the Senate vacancy. Ultimately, she withdrew and endorsed Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg of Teaneck to fill the seat. On October 5, after an extended legal battle related to inclusion of five disputed ballots, Weinberg was ultimately victorious over Hackensack Police Chief Ken Zisa in her bid to replace Baer, both on an interim basis and on the November General Election ballot.[10]
With Weinberg's court victory, Huttle and Englewood Mayor Michael Wildes both announced their candidacy for Weinberg's Assembly slot on the November general election ballot and to fill the balance of her term in the Assembly once she took her seat in the Senate. The choice was decided by yet another special convention of the Bergen County Democratic Committee on October 6, 2005, with Huttle out-polling Wildes 121-96 (Huttle would ultimately not serve the remainder of Weinberg's term).[11] Running together with Weinberg and incumbent Assemblyman Gordon M. Johnson, Huttle was elected on Election Day, November 8, 2005, to the Assembly and sworn in as a new member on January 10, 2006, the first day of the 212th Legislative Session.
As of 2015[update], Huttle chairs the Assembly Human Services Committee and sits on the Tourism, Gaming and the Arts Committee and the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation investigating the Fort Lee lane closure scandal. Since 2015, she has served as a Deputy Speaker.[1]
District 37[edit]
Each of the forty districts in the New Jersey Legislature has one representative in the New Jersey Senate and two members in the New Jersey General Assembly. The other representatives from the 37th District for the 2014-2015 Legislative Session are:

Senator Loretta Weinberg
Assemblyman Gordon M. Johnson

Biography and early political career[edit]
Huttle was born in 1956 to Anthony P. and Natalie Vainieri. Her family founded the Vainieri Funeral Home in North Bergen;[2] in addition, her father served on the North Bergen Board of Commissioners and one term in the General Assembly from the 32nd District from 1983 to 1985. Her brother Anthony P. Vainieri, Jr. is currently serving on the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders.[3] She is a state-licensed funeral director and has served as president of the funeral home since 1981.[4]
Huttle graduated cum laude from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1980 with a B.A. in English, and received state certification for teaching. She also attended Rider University, but did not receive a degree.[1] Huttle is a former member of the Board of Palisades General Hospital and founder of the Southern Bergen County Homeowners Association. She is also a co-founder of “WIN”, Women Involved Now, an educational and social network for women in the community. Huttle sits on the Board of Trustees as Vice-President of Shelter Our Sisters, an organization that brings awareness to the plight of victims of domestic violence while providing hope and revitalization to their lives through counseling and direct care. She has served as a former Trustee of Vantage Health.[4]
While a resident of Cliffside Park, Huttle mounted a bid for the New Jersey Senate in 1997 in the 38th District against Republican incumbent Louis F. Kosco. Despite raising more funds in the campaign than Kosco, she was defeated by him the general election 55% to 42%.[5][6] Three years later in 2000, by now a resident of Englewood, she and running mate Jack Alter (who was also the mayor of Fort Lee) defeated Republican incumbent Bergen County Freeholders Richard Mola and J.

Englewood mayor voted for project financed by bank he has a stake in


                        Says it's not a conflict because he didn't know bank would finance project




 Share on Facebook
 Share on Twitter


As a member of his town's planning board, Englewood Mayor Frank Huttle voted to approve a major project that turned out to be financed by a bank in which he’s one of the largest shareholders.
But it’s not a conflict, Huttle said, because he had no idea that the bank, ConnectOne — for which he serves as a member of the board of directors — would finance the project. Story Continued Below






“I first learned of the loan at the groundbreaking after the loan had taken place,” Huttle told POLITICO New Jersey. “Other than the bank representative attending the groundbreaking, I don’t know of any other specifics. “
Huttle, a Democrat who has been in office since 2008, wears several hats and is half of a New Jersey political power duo with his wife, longtime Democratic Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle. He’s also of counsel to the politically connected law firm DeCotiis, FitzPatrick & Cole, founder of the Bergen Performing Arts Center and a trustee at several charitable organizations. And as mayor of Englewood, he automatically has a seat on the planning board and appoints most of its members. Huttle is also a developer behind a major project in North Bergen called Hudson Mews. 
Huttle said that his vote was merely to approve a plan, the details of which had been settled on in 2011 and had been established by the city council.
“In essence it's a formality, that it was all part of a settlement agreement,” he said.
And he argued that the fact that this information is surfacing now is not indicative of his own conflict, but rather is the product of a political brawl that has consumed the Democratic Party in this town of 27,000 — a fight that stems in part from another matter involving the zoning board. 
New Jersey’s Municipal Land Use Law says that “no member of the planning board shall be permitted to act on any matter in which he has, either directly or indirectly, any personal or financial interest.”
And Huttle has a substantial financial interest in ConnectOne bank. He is on its board of directors and according to an SEC document as of June of 2015 owned 186,799 shares. At its Friday closing price of $15.64, that’s roughly $3 million. (There are 30 million outstanding shares of the bank).
Huttle is not the only politically connected person who owns a stake in the bank. Public relations mogul Michael Kempner, one of New Jersey’s biggest Democratic fundraisers, is also a major shareholder and member of its board, as is Stephen Boswell, who leads an engineering firm that had almost $12 million in public contracts in 2015.
“I have been advised as a matter of law, a conflict of interest is dependent upon knowledge of the conflict at the time it arises,” Huttle said. “All of the reported conflict cases involve recognition of the relationship at the time the public official is acting and I was unaware of the construction loan. There is absolutely no scenario where I would knowingly ignore a conflict and risk my reputation.”
The project financed by ConnectOne is ES4, an office building with retail space that’s part of a larger project that includes nearly 200 residential units. The planning board, include Huttle, voted 7-0 on April 9, 2015, to approve the project, according to the board’s minutes. 
But Huttle said that as a member of ConnectOne’s board, he is not involved in individual loan decisions or in hiring the people who approve the loans. He also noted that he has always publicly disclosed his stake in the bank on state-required forms. 
The office building is part of a larger project that is just now coming to fruition after years of litigation that pit the city and the developer, The Hekemian Group, against each other. 
It's unknown when the bank finalized its financing for ERA South, which is being developed by The Hekemian Group, because neither the bank nor the developer returned calls seeking comment. Nor is it known how much financing is involved. 
What is known is that on June 2, less than two months after the city’s planning board gave the project the go-ahead, Huttle and ConnectOne senior vice president William Tierney were photographed at its groundbreaking with ceremonial shovels of dirt.
ConnectOne is also involved in a project with Hekemian further north in Bergen County, in Montvale. 
Eugene Skurnick, an Englewood councilman and political opponent of Huttle, said he found it hard to believe that Huttle wouldn’t have known ConnectOne was financing the project.
“Frank Huttle in his professional life is occupied with every detail with everything. That’s the way he is the mayor of the city,” Skurnick said. “We have a weak-mayor form of government, but he’s involved in every aspect of everything. Council business, ward business, what the city manager is doing. He’s involved in almost everything. “
Skurnick also said it poses a potential conflict that Huttle’s business partner on his North Bergen project, developer James Demetrakis, is the chairman of Englewood’s planning board.
“I’m deeply concerned about that,” Skurnick said. 
Huttle earlier this month unsuccessfully backed a candidate in the Democratic primary to take out Skurnick’s council ally, Michael Cohen. Skurnick and Cohen, in turn, backed rival slate of Democratic municipal committee candidates that intended to take away local party influence from Huttle. 
Huttle himself has accused Skurnick’s political allies of conflicts of interest. In 2014, Huttle vetoed an ordinance that would have changed the zoning of a single-family property in town to allow building multi-family townhouses when it turned out that the property’s owner, Marvin Ahnalt, then the chairman of the planning board, owned it and had applied to build townhouses there. Cohen, who voted in favor of the ordinance, is Ahnalt’s second cousin by marriage, The Record reported.
Ahnalt was succeeded as chairman by Demetrakis, whom Huttle noted he did not name to the planning board.
“My business relationship has nothing to do with the city of Englewood,” Huttle said.
New Jersey courts use the standard when determining whether conflicts exist that they must, according to several decisions, “be interpreted to show that they had the likely capacity to tempt the official to depart from his own public duty," Huttle noted. 
Huttle said since he didn’t know about the development, there’s no way he could have been tempted.
On the other hand, New Jersey’s highest court has taken a broad view of where a conflict exists on zoning issues in at least one case.
Jonathan Guldin, an attorney from Montclair, represented a plaintiff who charged that a mayor and councilman were conflicted when they voted on a development next to a Unitarian church in which they held leadership positions. After losing at the trial and appellate court level, the Supreme Court ultimately sided with Guldin’s client.
Guldin said that under New Jersey's Local Government Ethics Law, a mayor with a major interest in a bank may have had a conflict regardless of whether he knew about it.
“The facts are that there was a mayor who was a shareholder of a bank that had the potential gain from this project. I think that would give, under the Local Government Ethics Law, a conflict,” he said. “And I don’t know that his knowledge is really material.”

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
