Michael Todman sees a world market full of potentialBENTON
TOWNSHIP — As the world's largest appliance company, Whirlpool
Corp. sells its products in about 170 countries.To Michael Todman,
that represents opportunity.Since Jan. 1, Todman, 48, has been
president of Whirlpool International. That means he's the top guy
for every country except the United States, Canada and
Mexico.Todman started with Whirlpool in 1993, in the United
Kingdom, then worked in Germany before coming to corporate
headquarters in Benton Township in 1995. In 2001, he moved to
Italy, before coming back here for his current job early this
year.Todman is a native of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands in
the Caribbean and attended and graduated from Northfield Mount
Hermon School, a private boarding school in Northfield, Mass.Todman
went to school there after its president vacationed in the Virgin
Islands and met his father.At Northfield, he met his wife-to-be,
Lynn. They will celebrate their 25th anniversary this year. "We
started dating when we were 17," he said.Lynn Todman is director of
the new Institute for Social Exclusion at the Adler School of
Professional Psychology in Chicago. The family lives in a
condominium in St. Joseph. Michael Todman earned a bachelor's
degree in business administration from Georgetown University in
Washington, D.C., where their son, Sean, 20, has completed his
sophomore year .Asked if he pressured his son to attend his alma
mater, Todman said, with a laugh, "What I learned is if you
pressure them, then they're definitely not going." Instead, he told
his son "I had a great time there; I thought it was a good
school."The Todmans' daughter, Melanie, 22, graduated this spring
from Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., with a major in
political science and minor in law.Todman was running Wang
Laboratories' business in the U.K. when he joined Whirlpool as
director, finance, United Kingdom. The computer hardware and
software company is no longer in business.Todman said he had some
hesitancy about changing employers because "I initially thought,
Ôthis is appliances,' and I was in the computer industry at a time
when it was fast moving."Although the appliance industry might have
seemed less glamorous, he said, "I joined because I thought, Ôgreat
company, great people.'"And, "I thought I would have lots of
opportunity to grow."Todman went from his Whirlpool job in the U.K.
to general manager, Northern Europe, and then vice president,
consumer services, Whirlpool Europe.He was promoted to, and finally
moved to, corporate headquarters in the Twin Cities in 1995 as
controller, North America. In 1996, he was promoted to vice
president, Product Management; in 1997, to vice president, Sears
Sales and Marketing; and in 1999, to senior vice president, Sales
and Marketing, North America.In March 2001, he became executive
vice president, North America, but in October of that year, he went
back to Europe, as executive vice president and president,
Whirlpool Europe.While Todman and his wife were in Italy, their
children attended and graduated from their alma mater, Northfield
Mount Hermon. As president of Whirlpool International, he said,
probably 40 to 50 percent of his time is spent "being someplace
else. I have a belief, I have a view Ð I guess a philosophy Ð that
says that the only way I can do this job is by knowing and
understanding the markets and the regions that we're doing business
in, so I have to be there."In mid-June he returned from about five
weeks visiting Brazil, India, China, Italy, France and the U.K. "It
was wonderful," Todman said of his trip. "I had a great time. One
of the things, the pleasures, is the diversity and the variety that
you see (between countries). …You also see all the opportunities
because you get ideas when you do that. "Todman said Whirlpool's
worldwide operations enable it to quickly share products developed
in one region with another. For instance, the technology for
Whirlpool's front-loading, energy-saving Duet clothes washer was
developed in Germany.A barrier to growth in appliance sales in many
less-developed countries has been creation of a reliable
electricity supply.Without it, for instance, people must shop daily
for groceries, since they don't have refrigerators. But with more
countries developing reliable electrical systems, "That provides us
a huge opportunity," Todman said.He said Whirlpool's international
business now totals about $6 billion a year. By 2010, he said he
expects it to reach $9 billion.Even when Todman is in his office at
Whirlpool corporate headquarters, the hours can be extremely long.
Because of the time differences (for instance, Asia is 12 or 13
hours ahead of Benton Harbor), he said he sometimes works from 6:30
a.m. to 8 or 9 at night.When he's not working, Todman said, "I like
to read. I like to be outside, I like to play tennis … and I'm
getting ready to take up golf."And, at the time of The
Herald-Palladium interview, he was looking forward to a weekend
fishing trip with his son.

Fettig said, "Marc is an exceptional leader at Whirlpool Corporation with broad global experiences and unique qualifications to assume his new position.  Marc has consistently demonstrated that he is an outstanding leader who has delivered strong results in his previous roles in both North America and Europe.  During the past year he and our European team have done an excellent job in integrating our major acquisition in Europe."
Fettig further said, "I have great confidence in Marc's ability to lead our global operations in driving both growth and value creation across our operations and advancing the company's strategy with our global leadership team."
