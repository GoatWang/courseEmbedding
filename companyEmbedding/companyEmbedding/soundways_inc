Core Production Bundle
Hear different presentations of your audio, including core frequencies most sensitive to the ear.  Get the sound you want faster, and shape bass that sounds remarkable on every system.
 
Start 14-Day Free Trial






















Reveal

Reveal is used to hear problems in the studio before they are heard on consumer listening systems.  The top row is used to listen to core frequencies the human ear finds most sensitive. 




LowLeveler

Low Leveler allows the user to balance bass instruments inside and outside of the core.  Set bass levels with more precision than ever, whether your studio is perfectly accurate or not.




AFMonitor

AfMonitor tracks the time you spend listening to help avoid ear fatigue and the flawed decisions that come from it.  









 






Available for Mac & PC in AAX, AU & VST FormatsMinimum Requirements: Mac OSX 10.8 or Windows 7 with Protools 10 or any VST2, VST3 or AU host.

Core Production Workflow
Use the Core Production Workflow to achieve professional quality and excellent translation.  Hear the audio core with clarity, and make better decisions, faster.
What is the Core?
The core is the portion of audio most sensitive to the human ear. 
Improving the Core
In the past, audio engineers used small speakers and NS10s to hear the core, although they were not designed for it.
Today, Reveal allows you to hear the core in the greatest detail using the full quality of your studio monitors.  Then, Low Leveler helps balance bass instruments within the core during mixing.  
Let's explore each step of Core Production.


Step #1:  Discover The Core
 

 
Place Reveal on your master bus so that all audio is routed through it.  Use Reveal's Critical Listening feature to listen to the audio core.


Step #2:  Make Adjustments While Listening to the Core
 





Select Sounds
Select sounds on synthesizers and samplers while listening to the core to achieve superior quality and avoid problems down the road.  
Select & Place Mics
Craft outstanding quality and improved tonalities by selecting and placing mics while evaluating the audio core with Reveal's Critical Listening feature.
Set Compressors
Hear how your compressor is working in higher detail and find unsurpassed attack, release and threshold settings by listening to the audio core.
Set Equalizers
Listening to the audio core allows you to find the most perfect EQ settings and with higher precision than ever.
Balance and Set Levels
It is extremely easy to hear loudness balance problems in a mix when listening to the core.  For example, if a vocal is too low, or a guitar is too loud, it will be extremely easy to hear and adjustments will be more precise than ever.


Perform De-Essing
Set up your de-esser with new precision by listening through Reveal's Harshness Listening while finding settings.
Address Harshness
While listening to the core, adjust the harshness of sources with your preferred EQ or processor.  You might try a wide shaped bell EQ around the 3kHz range.  Vocals too harsh?  Cymbals sound brash?  You will be able to adjust them with more precision than ever.  To add additional warmth, switch from Critical Listening to Harshness Listening in Reveal while adjusting harshness.
Set the Soundstage
Set reverbs, delay and panning while listening to the audio core and achieve a greater sense of depth.
Preview Translation
The audio core reveals translation issues before they are heard outside of the studio.
Mastering Decisions
For mastering, adjustments can be done better and faster by listening to the core, especially matching levels between songs and setting tonality.




Step #3:  Add Low Leveler To Bass Instruments

Low Leveler should be placed on each individual bass instrument including bass lines, bass drums and low toms.
Note:  If you are using multiple tracks to create a single bassline or bassdrum, we recommend to route the tracks into a single bus and place Low Leveler on that bus.


Step #4:  Set Upper Bass in the Core
 

 
While listening through Critical Listening in Reveal, adjust the upper bass of Low Leveler on each bass source.  Your bass will now translate to the car, headphones and other listening systems in an accurate way.


Step #5:  Set Low Bass Outside the Core
 

 
Turn off Critical Listening, and any other feature in Reveal, and adjust the low bass of Low Leveler on each bass source.  With this, you are setting the low bass frequencies of the bass instruments.


Next Generation Quality Achieved
 Core Quality Perfected
Through Core Focus, you have confidence in knowing the audio core sounds its best.
 Translation Achieved
You are sure your recordings sound as intended in the car, home speakers and on devices.
 Time Saved
You work faster and better.  Guessing games and shuffling between the car, headphones and the studio is over.
 Responsibility to Clients Fulfilled
Your clients get more traction because your work is always high quality, with incredible translation.
