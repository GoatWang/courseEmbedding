WILLIAMSBURG, Va. and AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Tempus Applied Solutions Holdings Inc. ("Tempus") (OTC: TMPS) announced today its wholly owned subsidiary, Tempus Applied Solutions LLC, has acquired Proflight Aviation Services LLC, a San Marcos, Texas-based company that operates Proflight Academy, a Federal Aviation Administration-approved Part 141 Certificate flight school. 
Since 2011, Proflight has been the core operator of San Marcos-based Skyport, an advanced flight training laboratory established by Redbird Flight Simulations Inc. that pairs advanced technologies with training methods for the general aviation industry. Tempus and Redbird Flight Simulations have jointly announced an agreement to transition the operation of Skyport to Tempus.
"The Tempus team leverages years of successful business operations in the aircraft industry, proven depth in applied cutting-edge technologies and a professional background in military and civilian flight training programs to deliver world-class flight training," said Scott Terry, CEO of Tempus. "Aviation is an increasingly integral part of life, and Tempus will build on Redbird's migration flight training philosophy and apply it across the spectrum of flight training operations to meet the increased demand for pilots." 
The Tempus-led flight school will continue to use and test Redbird's simulators, proficiency-based curriculum and Redbird's diesel Redhawk aircraft while offering pilot training at all levels under FAA Part 61 and Part 141 regulations. 
For more information about flight training at Skyport, contact Creig Rice, director of Tempus Training Solutions, at crice@tempus-as.com.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
