About
BeBop uses smart fabrics to create flexible pressure sensor solutions for OEMs. The key benefit of our technology vs traditional force sensors is that we allow manufacturers to measure pressure or force over complex geometries. Our sensors excel when measuring force, location, size, weight, shape, bend, motion and presence over a variety of curved, angled, and ergonomically challenging environments.
BeBop’s sensor technology is robust and proven with over two million sensors in daily commercial use via Keith McMillen Instrument products. See https://www.keithmcmillen.com/ for examples.
Based in Berkeley, California, BeBop Sensors is solely focused on helping companies “make things knowable” within their products.
Evolved From Musical Instruments
After six years of developing smart fabric sensors for his musical instrument company, Keith McMillen Instruments (KMI), BeBop Founder Keith McMillen decided to fulfill requests from OEMs.  At KMI, McMillen diligently tuned fabrics, geometries, and production processes to ship over 2 million sensors to some of the most demanding musicians in the world.
BeBop provides custom turnkey sensor solutions for OEMs to incorporate into their products. Solutions can range from basic sensors to complete wireless solutions with advanced power management. Visualization programs for any geometry with an easily-modified SDK allow manufacturers to create custom applications by choosing from an array of 2D and 3D representations and color palettes.

BeBop Sensors designs and manufactures custom smart fabric solutions for OEMs. Since launching in Q4 2014 BeBop has completed 14 new sensors for OEM solutions in numerous fields. According to Engineering.com, “BeBop’s future looks promising. They tout a technology that has already caught the eye of hundreds of companies in a range of different markets, from athletic goods to medical sensors to automotive.”


 
Commercially Proven Fabric Sensor Technology Shipping Today
BeBop’s sensor technology is based on smart-fabric that has been under development for 6 years. BeBop’s core sensor technology was originally deployed by Keith McMillen Instruments (KMI), which now has over 2 million smart fabric sensors in regular daily use. BeBop Sensors was spun out of KMI last year to take advantage of the growing need for practical fabric sensors with a proven record in design, manufacture and performance.
New BeBop Prototypes:



Smart Tire


Automotive – Smart Tire BeBop has developed a prototype “smart tire” that can sense the road surface, tire profile, and detailed information about the contact patch – the all-important hand sized area where the rubber literally meets the road.
CEO Keith McMillen says, “While tire pressure monitoring is becoming standard, greater knowledge of the tire’s profile and road engagement can be used to adjust suspension, enlighten anti-lock braking and report on tread depth”.




Gaming & VR – Disposable Data GlovesOther applications for the versatile smart fabrics include detailed sensing of bodily motion. A first generation prototype of an all fabric data glove provides information of finger flexing and abduction from 14 fabric sensors. Combined with BeBop’s previously announced data insole, a sophisticated VR sensing system for locomotion and manipulation is available to certain OEMs.
The Monolithic Fabric Sensor Technology can be used to produce sensors that are priced low enough to be considered disposable by medical and industrial standards.



Data Glove





Pressure Map


Universal Pressure MapsA simple single layer fabric sensor can map pressures from complex objects in real time. Size and resolution can be targeted for specific applications. A basic fabric sensor is responsive from 50 grams to 100 Kgs, a 2000:1 dynamic range. Resolutions from 2mm to 15mm with fabric thicknesses down to 0.3mm are readily available.
Applications for pressure maps are numerous, ranging from smart chairs that correct posture to sheets for hospital beds that track patient handling.


“The solutions BeBop offer for integration into wearable products is an impressive list…Wearable technology is a hot topic right now, and it seems like BeBop Sensors is staking claim in the industry at the right time.”
–Wearable Tech World

BeBop Introduces Wearable Smart Fabric Technology

by Jamison Williams
Posted on October 31, 2014

				in Technology 



Print PDF
Wearable technology company BeBop Sensors, Inc., created by musical instrument inventor Keith McMillen and his company Keith McMillen Instruments (KMI), unveiled its first product, the BeBop wearable smart fabric sensor. The ultra-thin fabric measures motion, bend, location, angle, rotation and torque, and can be applicable to the development of products including apparel, protective wear, footwear and athletic equipment.
While other sensors are limited to measuring electrical conductivity and physiology, the company said its smart fabric is able to measure real-time X/Y location, bend, force, stretch and motion, all on a 3D data map. The technology incorporates BeBop’s Monolithic Fabric Sensors, which integrates sensors, traces and electronics into a single piece of fabric to provide greater sensitivity, resolution, range of deployment and robustness, all within a tiny sensor.
BeBop and KMI founder McMillen said, “Bebop is a natural step for KMI, where we have diligently tuned fabrics, geometries, and production processes allowing us to ship over one million sensors to some of the most demanding musicians in the world. All musical instruments are essentially sensors without forms of acoustic processing attached. The same care and creativity used to build our instruments will serve well for our non-musical customers as we expand into the wearables market.”
McMillen added, “Good designs get the job done, great designs strive for an elegance and simplicity that will make the integration of wearable computing a seamless part of everyday life.”
Bebop is currently offering turnkey sensor solutions for OEMs to incorporate into their products.

						Bebop Sensors Launches Wearable Smart Sensor Fabric Technology					


					Oct 27, 2014 
					10:53 AM					| by
					Editorial Staff					| 
NO COMMENTS  




BeBop Sensors, Inc. www.bebopsensors.com, and KMI�have�announced its first product, the BeBop Wearable Smart Fabric Sensor, an ultra thin wearable smart fabric sensor that measures all aspects of physicality, including bend, location, motion, rotation, angle and torque.�Employing BeBop�s patented proprietary Monolithic Fabric Sensor Technology, BeBop fabric sensors continuously provide real-time reporting on force, x/y location, bend, twist, size, stretch and motion for markets, including clothing and protective wear, shoes, healthcare devices, athletic equipment, automotive, robotics, aerospace, gaming, biometrics, prosthetics, recycling monitors and appliance markets.
Unlike other wearable sensors on the market today that only measure physiology (EKG, EMG), electrical conductivity or breathing, BeBop measures actual physicality to sense and display 3D maps of data.�Fundamental, tested, and extensible with over a million sensors already in daily use through KMI�s musical instrument products, BeBop�s Monolithic Fabric Sensors integrate sensors, traces, and electronics into a single piece of fabric to provide greater sensitivity, resolution, range of deployment, and robustness — all with a tiny size.
Created for the rapidly-growing wearable technology market, BeBop sensor technology was created after six years of developing smart fabric sensors for more expressive musical instruments, such as KMI�s QuNexus and QuNeo keyboards.� After being approached by numerous companies requesting KMI�s fabric sensor technology, KMI launched spin-off company BeBop Sensors to fulfill the demand.
BeBop�s variety of solutions available now for integration into new wearable products:

Wearable Controllers: �for sleeves of jackets or shirts to connect to smartphones to answer calls, adjust volume or select songs, all while the smartphone remains in the user�s pocket.
1 mm Thin Shoe Insoles: �measures gait, pressure, contact style, fit, and flexure of toes and feet.
Planar, spherical or cylindrical geometries: �used as pressure maps, head sensors or handles of athletic equipment.
Smart Yoga and Gym Mats:� show hand and foot pressure for teaching.
Grip Sensors:� detail finger positions for baseball, golf, etc.
Car Seat Sensors:� senses airbag fill volume and passenger weight.
Car Steering Wheels: �sense driver alertness.
Weight Lifting Gloves:� indicate weight and even load.
Foot Volume Sensing:� anticipate Diabetic events.
Cycling Shoe Inserts:� power meters.

�BeBop is a natural step for KMI, where we have diligently tuned fabrics, geometries, and production processes allowing us to ship more than�1 million sensors to some of the most demanding musicians in the world,� said Keith McMillen, Founder, KMI and BeBop Sensors. ��All musical instruments are essentially sensors with forms of acoustic processing attached. �The same care and creativity used to build our instruments will serve well for our non-musical customers as we expand into the wearables market.�
BeBop is now offering custom turnkey sensor solutions for OEMs to incorporate into their products, ranging from basic sensors to complete wireless solutions with advanced power management. �Visualization programs for any design with an easily-modified SDK (Software Developer�s Kit) allows manufacturers to create custom apps by choosing from a variety of 2D and 3D representations and colors or by driving the BeBop data into whole new applications.

		Diabetic Events & Measure Gait through Insoles, Show Hand/Foot Location 
		on Gym Mats, & 
		Track Driver Alertness in Steering Wheels

		For Clothing, Shoes, & Gear for Sports, Medical, Gaming, Robotics,

Berkeley, 
		CA, October 27, 2014 � BeBop Sensors, Inc. 


		www.bebopsensors.com, 
		the wearable sensor technology company created 
		by musical instrument inventor 
Keith 
		McMillen and 
		KMI, announced today their first product, the BeBop Wearable Smart 
		Fabric Sensor, the first and only ultra thin wearable smart fabric 
		sensor that measures all aspects of physicality, including 
		bend, location, motion, rotation, angle, and torque.  Employing 
		BeBop�s patented proprietary Monolithic Fabric Sensor Technology, 
		BeBop fabric sensors continuously provide real-time reporting on 
		force, x/y location, bend, twist, size, stretch and motion for markets, 
		including clothing 
		and protective wear, shoes, healthcare devices, athletic equipment, 
		automotive, robotics, aerospace, gaming, biometrics, prosthetics, 
		recycling monitors and appliance markets. 

Smart 
		Fabric Sensor Solutions Provide 3D Maps of Data

		 

Unlike 
		other wearable sensors on the market today that only measure physiology 
		(EKG, EMG), electrical conductivity or breathing, BeBop measures actual 
		physicality to sense and display 3D maps of data.  Fundamental, 
		tested, and extensible 
		with over a million sensors already in daily use through KMI�s 
		musical instrument products, 
		BeBop�s Monolithic Fabric Sensors integrate sensors, traces, and 
		electronics into a single piece of fabric to provide greater 
		sensitivity, resolution, range of deployment, and robustness -- all with 
		a tiny size. 

BeBop 
		Elegant Smart Fabric Sensor Company for OEMs Spun Out from KMI Musical 
		Instrument Innovator 

Created 
		for the rapidly-growing wearable technology market, BeBop sensor 
		technology was created after six years of developing smart fabric 
		sensors for more expressive musical instruments, such as KMI�s popular 
		QuNexus and QuNeo keyboards.  After being approached by numerous 
		companies requesting KMI�s fabric sensor technology, KMI launched 
		spin-off company BeBop Sensors to fulfill the demand. 

BeBop�s 
		variety of solutions available now for integration into new wearable 
		products:

�       
		
Wearable 
		Controllers: 
		 for sleeves of jackets or shirts to connect to smartphones to answer 
		calls, adjust volume or select songs, all while the smartphone remains 
		in the user�s pocket.

�       
		
1mm
Thin Shoe Insoles:  measures gait, pressure, contact style, fit, 
		and flexure of toes and feet. 

�       
		
Planar, 
		spherical or cylindrical geometries: 
		 used as pressure maps, head sensors or handles of athletic equipment.
		

�       
		

		Smart Yoga and Gym Mats:  
		show hand and foot pressure for teaching.

�       
		

		Grip Sensors:  
		detail finger positions for baseball, golf, etc.

�       
		

		Car Seat Sensors:  
		senses airbag fill volume and passenger weight.

�       
		

		Car Steering Wheels: 
		 sense driver alertness.

�       
		

		Weight Lifting Gloves:  
		indicate weight and even load.

�       
		

		Foot Volume Sensing:  
		anticipate Diabetic events.

�       
		

		Cycling Shoe Inserts:  
		power meters.

�BeBop is 
		a natural step for KMI, where we have diligently tuned fabrics, 
		geometries, and production processes allowing us to ship over 1 
		million sensors to some of the most demanding musicians in the 
		world,� said Keith McMillen, Founder, KMI and BeBop Sensors.  �All 
		musical instruments are essentially sensors with forms of acoustic 
		processing attached.  The same care and creativity used to build our 
		instruments will serve well for our non-musical customers as we expand 
		into the wearables market.� 

BeBop OEM 
		Turnkey Offerings Now Available 

BeBop is 
		now offering custom turnkey sensor solutions for OEMs to incorporate 
		into their products, ranging from basic sensors to complete wireless 
		solutions with advanced power management.  Visualization programs for 
		any design with an easily-modified SDK (Software Developer�s Kit) allows 
		manufacturers to create custom apps by choosing from a variety of 2D and 
		3D representations and colors or by driving the BeBop data into whole 
		new applications.   

�Good 
		designs get the job done, great designs strive for an elegance and 
		simplicity that will make the integration of wearable computing a 
		seamless part of everyday life,� said McMillen.  When McMillen created a 
		foot controller allowing disabled people complete control of a computer,
		Forbes reported: �In 1984, Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs made 
		the computer mouse mainstream. In 2010, Microsoft introduced the Kinect, 
		allowing computer gamers to control video games by moving their bodies. 
		And on June 21, 2011, Keith McMillen Instruments introduced a gadget 
		that lets you use your computer with your feet.�
