The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

SPACES Announces Advisory Board Appointments
Mar 22 17
Ian Richter and former Disney Imagineer Joe Garlington have joined virtual reality pioneer SPACES Inc. as members of its advisory board. Richter most recently served as executive vice president of franchise and emerging platform development at Legendary Entertainment, and spent more than seven years at DreamWorks Animation as head of creative franchise development and franchise executive producer. Prior to retiring in 2014, Garlington was the vice president and executive creative director of Walt Disney Imagineering’s interactive group.


SPACES Inc. and Songcheng Performance Development Co. Ltd. Form Joint Venture to Bring Virtual and Mixed Reality to China’s Top Theme Parks and Live-Streaming Video Service
Jun 7 16
Virtual reality will thrill visitors to mainland China’s most popular theme parks under a groundbreaking $30 million joint venture announced between SPACES Inc. and Songcheng Performance Development Co. Ltd. Utilizing creative tools and technology SPACES is developing specifically for theme parks, the joint venture will bring unprecedented virtual reality and mixed reality attractions to Songcheng’s theme parks – which drew nearly 23 million parkgoers in 2015, according to Themed Entertainment Association data. SPACES will also work with Songcheng to bring its massively popular live-streaming video site 6Rooms (6.cn) – which has more than 33 million unique users every month – to VR and MxR platforms. For Songcheng’s 6Rooms, SPACES will create VR experiences that further enhance China’s large online platform for performing arts. 6Rooms users create and watch more than 50,000 live broadcast hours each day. SPACES also will provide technology, develop creative concepts, produce and publish VR and MxR experiences, and furnish tech-support services, while Songcheng will operate and promote the VR and MxR attractions. SPACES will also license the underlying software to Songcheng. Under the agreement, the joint venture will be based in Hangzhou, China, and co-managed by SPACES from its headquarters in Los Angeles. In addition to its joint venture with Songcheng, SPACES has raised $3 million in seed funding from investors led by Comcast Ventures and including Boost VC; Canyon Creek Capital; Colopl VR Fund; GREE Inc.; Kai Huang; The Venture Reality Fund; the Sinovation Fund; and Youku Global Media Fund and CRCM VC.
