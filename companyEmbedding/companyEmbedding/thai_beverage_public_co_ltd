Overview[edit]




Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, company president and CEO


Thai Beverage Public Company Limited owns and distributes several significant brands, including Chang beer, Mekhongand SangSom rum. It also has significant operations in Europe, producing malt Scotch whisky, vodka, gin, and liqueurs with over 20 distilleries in Scotland, France, Poland, and Ireland. Mr Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi in early 2013, added Fraser and Neave, Limited, a food and beverage, brewing, property, and publishing industries conglomerate in Singapore, to his drinks and property empire.[4]
Chang Beer, which started production in March 1995 at their brewery in Bang Ban District of Ayutthaya Province, is the top-selling brand in Thailand. It managed to win 60 percent market share in Thailand after a hard market fight with the previous leading brand, Singha. In 2006, the company's beer market share was 49 percent, according to research company Canadean.
Beer[edit]

ThaiBev brews Chang (or Chang Beer) (Thai: เบียร์ช้าง), a pale lager. Chang (Thai: ช้าง) is the Thai word for elephant, an animal with cultural and historical significance in Thailand. The logo features two elephants facing each other.
In 2004, the company introduced Archa beer, at 5.4 percent abv. Archa won a gold medal at the 2007 Australian International Beer Awards (AIBA). The abv was lowered to 4.9 percent in 2014. The first market outside Thailand to distribute Archa Beer was Singapore and it was successfully launched in Singapore back in 2012 by InterBev (Singapore) Ltd.[1].
In 2006, the company launched Chang Light, 4.2 percent abv and Chang Draught in bottles, at five percent abv. They were discontinued in 2015.[citation needed]
ThaiBev's flagship brand Chang Beer won a gold quality award three times in the beers, water and soft drinks category at the World Quality Selections, organized each year by Monde Selection.[5]
In 2015 ThaiBev consolidated all brands into Chang Classic. ThaiBev stopped production of Archa, Chang Beer, Chang Draught, and Chang Export.[6] Production of Chang Classic is shared between ThaiBev’s three breweries. The recipe was changed to include rice, previously only used in the domestic 6.4% version. The abv varies between 5% and 5.5% abv depending on the market.
Chang/Carlsberg history[edit]
In December 2000 Carlsberg and Chang established a 50/50 joint venture, Carlsberg Asia, to create a significant brewing company in Asia.[7] The Carlsberg influence can be seen in the typography of the "Beer Chang" logo, which resembles the classic "Carlsberg Beer".[8] In 2005 Carlsberg pulled out of the venture and terminated its licence agreement with Chang due to non-fulfillment of contractual obligations, resulting in Chang claiming US$2.5 billion in damages.[7] A final settlement of US$120 million was subsequently paid by Carlsberg.[citation needed]
Spirits[edit]
ThaiBev produces brown and white spirits, including rum, which is derived from distilling cane juice, sugar or molasses until the product is with 60–95% alcohol content. The content is mixed with purified water to produce a satisfactory level of alcohol content before being transferred to age in charred oak barrels for at least one year. Before being bottled the liquor may be further mixed to adjust for desired colour, aroma and taste, but it has to have at least 40% alcohol content.
ThaiBev's most famous, but not best selling, spirit is Mekhong, which originated in 1941 at the Bangyikhan Distillery west of Bangkok. Originally a state-owned distillery, it dates back over 200 years to the beginning of the current Chakri Dynasty. The launch of Mekhong was aimed at producing high-quality Thai spirit to stem the increase in the import of foreign liquor and to eventually replace imported brands. SangSom, however, has been the country’s most popular spirit brand for over 29 years, until 2006 holding almost 50 percent share of the entire brown spirits market in Thailand. The company also produces Mungkorn Thong and Hong Thong and brands based on whisky, such as Crown 99 and Blue, as well as Scotch whisky brands such as Hankey Banister and Pinwinnie Royal Scotch Whisky.
White spirits are made from molasses without any mixture or colour, and produced in four alcohol contents: 28, 30, 35, and 40 percent. The company's largest-selling white spirits is Ruang Khao. The labels are colour-coded to reflect the alcoholic strength but do not have the brand name printed on them. Other brands in this category are Niyomthai and White Tiger.
Production[edit]
Molasses is the main raw material used for the production of ThaiBev's spirits, so that most of the products fall under the category of rum. Molasses is a by-product of the manufacture of raw sugar from sugar cane. As is the case with all distilled spirits, the distillate is crystal clear when first distilled. Amber and dark brown spirits obtain their colour from the extracts from the oak barrel during aging and from caramel, a natural colouring agent.
ThaiBev's yeast cultures, used for fermentation, are grown in its own laboratory and propagated in a yeast propagation tank. The yeast, molasses diluted by water, steamed rice that has been sprayed with mould (to create sugar) and incubated for four days, and water are added into a fermenter and the mixture is allowed to ferment for approximately 72 hours. The liquid that is left at the end of the fermentation process is known as fermented mash.
Distillation takes place in a distilling column and a pot still, which is a large copper or stainless steel kettle. Distilling involves boiling the "fermented mash" and condensing its vapour. The spent sludge remaining in the pot still is removed to be processed. The company's white spirits are then diluted with demineralized water to the desired alcohol content in a white spirits blending tank and sent to be packaged and bottled after filtering.
Brown spirits are diluted with demineralized water and then aged in oak barrels for three to eight years depending on the brand. The aged alcohol is then further diluted with demineralized water before bottling. Liquor concentrate alcohol and caramel color are added. The brown spirits are passed through filters and then bottled and packaged. ThaiBev also makes Chinese herb spirits, branded as Chiang-Chun and Sua Dum. These are produced by blending alcohol, white spirits, sugar, caramel, and Chinese herbs, and then further diluting the mixture with demineralized water.
Everton-Chang[edit]
In 2004 Chang became the sponsor of Everton Football Club of the English Premier League. Together, they initiated five projects in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Thailand.
Everton-Chang is a village on the Khao Lak coast in Phang Nga Province of Thailand. It consists of 50 houses and a football field. It was built following the 2004 tsunami that struck the area and destroyed the existing village of Ban Naan Khem. Local youth teams compete for the Chang-Everton cup. Officials from Everton F.C. and Chang Beer have been involved in the project. Together, they sponsor Chang Everton Football Cup and send promising Thai footballers to Liverpool for a trial with Everton.
Criticism and protest[edit]
In 2005, ThaiBev was became subject of nationwide criticism by the Buddhist monastic community and other religious groups. At the time, Thai Beverage had announced its intent to list publicly on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which would be the biggest listing in Thai history.[9][10] Despite attempts by the National Office of Buddhism (a government agency) to prohibit monks from protesting, 2,000 monks from Wat Phra Dhammakaya organized chants of Buddhist texts in front of the Stock Exchange to halt Thai Beverage's IPO.[11][12][note 1] In an unprecedented cooperative effort, the temple was joined by former Black May revolt leader Chamlong Srimuang and the Santi Asoke movement. Subsequently, another 122 religious and social organizations joined the opposition, reaching numbers of 10,000 protesters. The organizations asked Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's cooperation to stop the company, in what some of the protest leaders described as "a grave threat to the health and culture" of Thai society.[11][12][13] While the Stock Exchange pointed out the economic benefits of the listing, opponents referred to rising alcohol abuse in Thai society, ranking fifth in alcohol consumption according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Ultimately, the protests led to an indefinite postponement of the listing by the Stock Exchange.[14][15] Thai Beverage chose to list in Singapore instead, as the Thai Stock Exchange chief resigned as a result.[16][17]

The content is mixed with purified water to produce a satisfactory level of alcohol content before being transferred to age in charred oak barrels for at least one year. Before being bottled the liquor may be further mixed to adjust for desired colour, aroma and taste, but it has to have at least 40% alcohol content.
ThaiBev's most famous, but not best selling, spirit is Mekhong, which originated in 1941 at the Bangyikhan Distillery west of Bangkok. Originally a state-owned distillery, it dates back over 200 years to the beginning of the current Chakri Dynasty. The launch of Mekhong was aimed at producing high-quality Thai spirit to stem the increase in the import of foreign liquor and to eventually replace imported brands. SangSom, however, has been the country’s most popular spirit brand for over 29 years, until 2006 holding almost 50 percent share of the entire brown spirits market in Thailand. The company also produces Mungkorn Thong and Hong Thong and brands based on whisky, such as Crown 99 and Blue, as well as Scotch whisky brands such as Hankey Banister and Pinwinnie Royal Scotch Whisky.
White spirits are made from molasses without any mixture or colour, and produced in four alcohol contents: 28, 30, 35, and 40 percent. The company's largest-selling white spirits is Ruang Khao. The labels are colour-coded to reflect the alcoholic strength but do not have the brand name printed on them. Other brands in this category are Niyomthai and White Tiger.
Production[edit]
Molasses is the main raw material used for the production of ThaiBev's spirits, so that most of the products fall under the category of rum. Molasses is a by-product of the manufacture of raw sugar from sugar cane. As is the case with all distilled spirits, the distillate is crystal clear when first distilled. Amber and dark brown spirits obtain their colour from the extracts from the oak barrel during aging and from caramel, a natural colouring agent.
ThaiBev's yeast cultures, used for fermentation, are grown in its own laboratory and propagated in a yeast propagation tank. The yeast, molasses diluted by water, steamed rice that has been sprayed with mould (to create sugar) and incubated for four days, and water are added into a fermenter and the mixture is allowed to ferment for approximately 72 hours. The liquid that is left at the end of the fermentation process is known as fermented mash.
Distillation takes place in a distilling column and a pot still, which is a large copper or stainless steel kettle. Distilling involves boiling the "fermented mash" and condensing its vapour. The spent sludge remaining in the pot still is removed to be processed. The company's white spirits are then diluted with demineralized water to the desired alcohol content in a white spirits blending tank and sent to be packaged and bottled after filtering.
Brown spirits are diluted with demineralized water and then aged in oak barrels for three to eight years depending on the brand. The aged alcohol is then further diluted with demineralized water before bottling. Liquor concentrate alcohol and caramel color are added. The brown spirits are passed through filters and then bottled and packaged. ThaiBev also makes Chinese herb spirits, branded as Chiang-Chun and Sua Dum. These are produced by blending alcohol, white spirits, sugar, caramel, and Chinese herbs, and then further diluting the mixture with demineralized water.
Everton-Chang[edit]
In 2004 Chang became the sponsor of Everton Football Club of the English Premier League. Together, they initiated five projects in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Thailand.
Everton-Chang is a village on the Khao Lak coast in Phang Nga Province of Thailand. It consists of 50 houses and a football field. It was built following the 2004 tsunami that struck the area and destroyed the existing village of Ban Naan Khem. Local youth teams compete for the Chang-Everton cup. Officials from Everton F.C. and Chang Beer have been involved in the project. Together, they sponsor Chang Everton Football Cup and send promising Thai footballers to Liverpool for a trial with Everton.
Criticism and protest[edit]
In 2005, ThaiBev was became subject of nationwide criticism by the Buddhist monastic community and other religious groups. At the time, Thai Beverage had announced its intent to list publicly on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which would be the biggest listing in Thai history.[9][10] Despite attempts by the National Office of Buddhism (a government agency) to prohibit monks from protesting, 2,000 monks from Wat Phra Dhammakaya organized chants of Buddhist texts in front of the Stock Exchange to halt Thai Beverage's IPO.[11][12][note 1] In an unprecedented cooperative effort, the temple was joined by former Black May revolt leader Chamlong Srimuang and the Santi Asoke movement. Subsequently, another 122 religious and social organizations joined the opposition, reaching numbers of 10,000 protesters. The organizations asked Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's cooperation to stop the company, in what some of the protest leaders described as "a grave threat to the health and culture" of Thai society.[11][12][13] While the Stock Exchange pointed out the economic benefits of the listing, opponents referred to rising alcohol abuse in Thai society, ranking fifth in alcohol consumption according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Ultimately, the protests led to an indefinite postponement of the listing by the Stock Exchange.[14][15] Thai Beverage chose to list in Singapore instead, as the Thai Stock Exchange chief resigned as a result.[16][17]

Overview[edit]




Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, company president and CEO


Thai Beverage Public Company Limited owns and distributes several significant brands, including Chang beer, Mekhongand SangSom rum. It also has significant operations in Europe, producing malt Scotch whisky, vodka, gin, and liqueurs with over 20 distilleries in Scotland, France, Poland, and Ireland. Mr Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi in early 2013, added Fraser and Neave, Limited, a food and beverage, brewing, property, and publishing industries conglomerate in Singapore, to his drinks and property empire.[4]
Chang Beer, which started production in March 1995 at their brewery in Bang Ban District of Ayutthaya Province, is the top-selling brand in Thailand. It managed to win 60 percent market share in Thailand after a hard market fight with the previous leading brand, Singha. In 2006, the company's beer market share was 49 percent, according to research company Canadean.
Beer[edit]

ThaiBev brews Chang (or Chang Beer) (Thai: เบียร์ช้าง), a pale lager. Chang (Thai: ช้าง) is the Thai word for elephant, an animal with cultural and historical significance in Thailand. The logo features two elephants facing each other.
In 2004, the company introduced Archa beer, at 5.4 percent abv. Archa won a gold medal at the 2007 Australian International Beer Awards (AIBA). The abv was lowered to 4.9 percent in 2014. The first market outside Thailand to distribute Archa Beer was Singapore and it was successfully launched in Singapore back in 2012 by InterBev (Singapore) Ltd.[1].
In 2006, the company launched Chang Light, 4.2 percent abv and Chang Draught in bottles, at five percent abv. They were discontinued in 2015.[citation needed]
ThaiBev's flagship brand Chang Beer won a gold quality award three times in the beers, water and soft drinks category at the World Quality Selections, organized each year by Monde Selection.[5]
In 2015 ThaiBev consolidated all brands into Chang Classic. ThaiBev stopped production of Archa, Chang Beer, Chang Draught, and Chang Export.[6] Production of Chang Classic is shared between ThaiBev’s three breweries. The recipe was changed to include rice, previously only used in the domestic 6.4% version. The abv varies between 5% and 5.5% abv depending on the market.
Chang/Carlsberg history[edit]
In December 2000 Carlsberg and Chang established a 50/50 joint venture, Carlsberg Asia, to create a significant brewing company in Asia.[7] The Carlsberg influence can be seen in the typography of the "Beer Chang" logo, which resembles the classic "Carlsberg Beer".[8] In 2005 Carlsberg pulled out of the venture and terminated its licence agreement with Chang due to non-fulfillment of contractual obligations, resulting in Chang claiming US$2.5 billion in damages.[7] A final settlement of US$120 million was subsequently paid by Carlsberg.[citation needed]

SangSom, however, has been the country’s most popular spirit brand for over 29 years, until 2006 holding almost 50 percent share of the entire brown spirits market in Thailand. The company also produces Mungkorn Thong and Hong Thong and brands based on whisky, such as Crown 99 and Blue, as well as Scotch whisky brands such as Hankey Banister and Pinwinnie Royal Scotch Whisky.
White spirits are made from molasses without any mixture or colour, and produced in four alcohol contents: 28, 30, 35, and 40 percent. The company's largest-selling white spirits is Ruang Khao. The labels are colour-coded to reflect the alcoholic strength but do not have the brand name printed on them. Other brands in this category are Niyomthai and White Tiger.

Amber and dark brown spirits obtain their colour from the extracts from the oak barrel during aging and from caramel, a natural colouring agent.
ThaiBev's yeast cultures, used for fermentation, are grown in its own laboratory and propagated in a yeast propagation tank. The yeast, molasses diluted by water, steamed rice that has been sprayed with mould (to create sugar) and incubated for four days, and water are added into a fermenter and the mixture is allowed to ferment for approximately 72 hours. The liquid that is left at the end of the fermentation process is known as fermented mash.
Distillation takes place in a distilling column and a pot still, which is a large copper or stainless steel kettle. Distilling involves boiling the "fermented mash" and condensing its vapour. The spent sludge remaining in the pot still is removed to be processed. The company's white spirits are then diluted with demineralized water to the desired alcohol content in a white spirits blending tank and sent to be packaged and bottled after filtering.
Brown spirits are diluted with demineralized water and then aged in oak barrels for three to eight years depending on the brand. The aged alcohol is then further diluted with demineralized water before bottling. Liquor concentrate alcohol and caramel color are added. The brown spirits are passed through filters and then bottled and packaged. ThaiBev also makes Chinese herb spirits, branded as Chiang-Chun and Sua Dum. These are produced by blending alcohol, white spirits, sugar, caramel, and Chinese herbs, and then further diluting the mixture with demineralized water.
Everton-Chang[edit]
In 2004 Chang became the sponsor of Everton Football Club of the English Premier League. Together, they initiated five projects in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Thailand.
Everton-Chang is a village on the Khao Lak coast in Phang Nga Province of Thailand. It consists of 50 houses and a football field. It was built following the 2004 tsunami that struck the area and destroyed the existing village of Ban Naan Khem. Local youth teams compete for the Chang-Everton cup. Officials from Everton F.C. and Chang Beer have been involved in the project. Together, they sponsor Chang Everton Football Cup and send promising Thai footballers to Liverpool for a trial with Everton.
Criticism and protest[edit]
In 2005, ThaiBev was became subject of nationwide criticism by the Buddhist monastic community and other religious groups. At the time, Thai Beverage had announced its intent to list publicly on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which would be the biggest listing in Thai history.[9][10] Despite attempts by the National Office of Buddhism (a government agency) to prohibit monks from protesting, 2,000 monks from Wat Phra Dhammakaya organized chants of Buddhist texts in front of the Stock Exchange to halt Thai Beverage's IPO.[11][12][note 1] In an unprecedented cooperative effort, the temple was joined by former Black May revolt leader Chamlong Srimuang and the Santi Asoke movement. Subsequently, another 122 religious and social organizations joined the opposition, reaching numbers of 10,000 protesters. The organizations asked Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's cooperation to stop the company, in what some of the protest leaders described as "a grave threat to the health and culture" of Thai society.[11][12][13] While the Stock Exchange pointed out the economic benefits of the listing, opponents referred to rising alcohol abuse in Thai society, ranking fifth in alcohol consumption according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Ultimately, the protests led to an indefinite postponement of the listing by the Stock Exchange.[14][15] Thai Beverage chose to list in Singapore instead, as the Thai Stock Exchange chief resigned as a result.[16][17]

Overview[edit]




Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, company president and CEO


Thai Beverage Public Company Limited owns and distributes several significant brands, including Chang beer, Mekhongand SangSom rum. It also has significant operations in Europe, producing malt Scotch whisky, vodka, gin, and liqueurs with over 20 distilleries in Scotland, France, Poland, and Ireland. Mr Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi in early 2013, added Fraser and Neave, Limited, a food and beverage, brewing, property, and publishing industries conglomerate in Singapore, to his drinks and property empire.[4]
Chang Beer, which started production in March 1995 at their brewery in Bang Ban District of Ayutthaya Province, is the top-selling brand in Thailand. It managed to win 60 percent market share in Thailand after a hard market fight with the previous leading brand, Singha. In 2006, the company's beer market share was 49 percent, according to research company Canadean.
Beer[edit]

ThaiBev brews Chang (or Chang Beer) (Thai: เบียร์ช้าง), a pale lager. Chang (Thai: ช้าง) is the Thai word for elephant, an animal with cultural and historical significance in Thailand. The logo features two elephants facing each other.
In 2004, the company introduced Archa beer, at 5.4 percent abv. Archa won a gold medal at the 2007 Australian International Beer Awards (AIBA). The abv was lowered to 4.9 percent in 2014. The first market outside Thailand to distribute Archa Beer was Singapore and it was successfully launched in Singapore back in 2012 by InterBev (Singapore) Ltd.[1].
In 2006, the company launched Chang Light, 4.2 percent abv and Chang Draught in bottles, at five percent abv. They were discontinued in 2015.[citation needed]
ThaiBev's flagship brand Chang Beer won a gold quality award three times in the beers, water and soft drinks category at the World Quality Selections, organized each year by Monde Selection.[5]
In 2015 ThaiBev consolidated all brands into Chang Classic. ThaiBev stopped production of Archa, Chang Beer, Chang Draught, and Chang Export.[6] Production of Chang Classic is shared between ThaiBev’s three breweries. The recipe was changed to include rice, previously only used in the domestic 6.4% version. The abv varies between 5% and 5.5% abv depending on the market.
Chang/Carlsberg history[edit]
In December 2000 Carlsberg and Chang established a 50/50 joint venture, Carlsberg Asia, to create a significant brewing company in Asia.[7] The Carlsberg influence can be seen in the typography of the "Beer Chang" logo, which resembles the classic "Carlsberg Beer".[8] In 2005 Carlsberg pulled out of the venture and terminated its licence agreement with Chang due to non-fulfillment of contractual obligations, resulting in Chang claiming US$2.5 billion in damages.[7] A final settlement of US$120 million was subsequently paid by Carlsberg.[citation needed]
Spirits[edit]
ThaiBev produces brown and white spirits, including rum, which is derived from distilling cane juice, sugar or molasses until the product is with 60–95% alcohol content. The content is mixed with purified water to produce a satisfactory level of alcohol content before being transferred to age in charred oak barrels for at least one year. Before being bottled the liquor may be further mixed to adjust for desired colour, aroma and taste, but it has to have at least 40% alcohol content.
ThaiBev's most famous, but not best selling, spirit is Mekhong, which originated in 1941 at the Bangyikhan Distillery west of Bangkok. Originally a state-owned distillery, it dates back over 200 years to the beginning of the current Chakri Dynasty. The launch of Mekhong was aimed at producing high-quality Thai spirit to stem the increase in the import of foreign liquor and to eventually replace imported brands. SangSom, however, has been the country’s most popular spirit brand for over 29 years, until 2006 holding almost 50 percent share of the entire brown spirits market in Thailand. The company also produces Mungkorn Thong and Hong Thong and brands based on whisky, such as Crown 99 and Blue, as well as Scotch whisky brands such as Hankey Banister and Pinwinnie Royal Scotch Whisky.
White spirits are made from molasses without any mixture or colour, and produced in four alcohol contents: 28, 30, 35, and 40 percent. The company's largest-selling white spirits is Ruang Khao. The labels are colour-coded to reflect the alcoholic strength but do not have the brand name printed on them. Other brands in this category are Niyomthai and White Tiger.
Production[edit]
Molasses is the main raw material used for the production of ThaiBev's spirits, so that most of the products fall under the category of rum. Molasses is a by-product of the manufacture of raw sugar from sugar cane. As is the case with all distilled spirits, the distillate is crystal clear when first distilled. Amber and dark brown spirits obtain their colour from the extracts from the oak barrel during aging and from caramel, a natural colouring agent.
ThaiBev's yeast cultures, used for fermentation, are grown in its own laboratory and propagated in a yeast propagation tank. The yeast, molasses diluted by water, steamed rice that has been sprayed with mould (to create sugar) and incubated for four days, and water are added into a fermenter and the mixture is allowed to ferment for approximately 72 hours. The liquid that is left at the end of the fermentation process is known as fermented mash.
Distillation takes place in a distilling column and a pot still, which is a large copper or stainless steel kettle. Distilling involves boiling the "fermented mash" and condensing its vapour. The spent sludge remaining in the pot still is removed to be processed. The company's white spirits are then diluted with demineralized water to the desired alcohol content in a white spirits blending tank and sent to be packaged and bottled after filtering.
Brown spirits are diluted with demineralized water and then aged in oak barrels for three to eight years depending on the brand. The aged alcohol is then further diluted with demineralized water before bottling. Liquor concentrate alcohol and caramel color are added. The brown spirits are passed through filters and then bottled and packaged. ThaiBev also makes Chinese herb spirits, branded as Chiang-Chun and Sua Dum. These are produced by blending alcohol, white spirits, sugar, caramel, and Chinese herbs, and then further diluting the mixture with demineralized water.
Everton-Chang[edit]
In 2004 Chang became the sponsor of Everton Football Club of the English Premier League. Together, they initiated five projects in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Thailand.
Everton-Chang is a village on the Khao Lak coast in Phang Nga Province of Thailand. It consists of 50 houses and a football field. It was built following the 2004 tsunami that struck the area and destroyed the existing village of Ban Naan Khem. Local youth teams compete for the Chang-Everton cup. Officials from Everton F.C. and Chang Beer have been involved in the project. Together, they sponsor Chang Everton Football Cup and send promising Thai footballers to Liverpool for a trial with Everton.

6th Annual Southeast Asiaâs Institutional Investor Corporate Awards 2016
				


Growth
Efficient growth is key for business expansion and yielding
sustainable returns to stakeholders. We aim to secure
ThaiBev’s leadership position as the largest beverage
company in Southeast Asia and generate sustainable
return for shareholders by developing innovative products,
diversifying our portfolio, leveraging our efficient
distribution network in core markets, and expanding our
business in Southeast Asia. Through our collaboration with
Fraser and Neave, Limited (“F&N”), Singapore’s leading
beverage producer and distributor, as well as publisher,
we are strengthening our foundation for sustainable growth
in the future.
Diversity
Attaining business sustainability from diversified revenue
streams is core to our plan. This involves increasing income
contribution from our non-alcoholic beverage segment and
overseas sales.
Our expansion into the non-alcoholic beverage market is an
important part of our strategy to become the leading total
beverage producer and distributor in the region. We focus on
offering a more diversified product portfolio and optimizing our
distribution network. ThaiBev’s expansion into the
non-alcoholic beverage segment commenced in 2008 with
the acquisition of Oishi Group Public Company Limited (“Oishi”)
– the No. 1 green tea beverage producer in Thailand.
Thereafter, we acquired Sermsuk Public Company Limited
(“Sermsuk”) – the beverage producer with the most extensive
distribution network in Thailand – in 2011; and F&N, a leading
Singapore company in the beverage, publishing, and printing
industries, in 2012.
In our pursuit of overseas expansion, we view ASEAN countries
as high-growth markets. Purchasing power in these markets,
which have a total population of over 600 million people,
is increasing amid the growth of their economies, and the rise
in the numbers of investors and tourists to the country.
Beverages from Thailand have high growth potential in these
markets. Consumer behavior in ASEAN countries, especially
Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Vietnam, has been strongly
influenced by the popularity of Thai media broadcasts, singers,
and superstars in these countries, as well as their substantial
native labour force working in Thailand.
Furthermore, ThaiBev’s alliance with F&N has opened up many
opportunities for joint investment in ASEAN. We have adapted
successful business models from Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore
for other countries while fostering further cooperation to
optimize brand and distribution synergies. For instance, Oishi
successfully penetrated the Myanmar market by collaborating
with F&N’s branch offices in the country. Moreover, we leveraged
Fraser and Neave Holding Berhad’s robust production facilities
in Malaysia for our expansion into other halal markets in
Southeast Asia.
Brand
In 2014, we re-organized ThaiBev’s management structure
and streamlined our core businesses into three product
groups – spirits, beer, and non-alcoholic beverage. We also
identified the core products of each business, namely,
“Ruangkhao”, “Hongthong”, “Blend 285”, “Chang” beer,
“est” soft drinks, “Oishi” green tea, and “100PLUS”.
In the year 2016, we furthered our success through
continued product innovation and the introduction of
more modern packaging in line with our premiumization
strategy.
Our efforts in the spirits product group were focused on
the development of ThaiBev’s flagship “Hongthong” brand,
which has been the No. 1 brand in the brown spirits
category, and “Blend 285” brand through music campaigns
as well as product premiumization. These help us to ensure
that ThaiBev serves consumers in all segments. Moreover,
we revamped the labels of “Blend 285 Signature” and
“Meridian” brandy to give them a more glamorous and
international image. Customer feedback following the revamp
has been positive and the sales volume of both brands
have increased. In late 2015, we began launching our
Scotch whiskies such as “Old Pulteney” and “anCnoc”,
as well as our “Caorunn” gin, in luxury hotels and
restaurants in Thailand.
For the beer product group, “Chang Classic” in the new
emerald green bottle and a champagne gold label has
received greater feedback than expected, representing
a major step on our path towards realizing Vision 2020,
and becoming the top leader in Thailand’s beer market
and achieve significant growth in Southeast Asia.
In addition, the label of “Archa” beer has been revamped
to be more beautiful and modern.
To realize our potential and secure our market leadership
in the non-alcoholic beverage segment, we constantly
introduce innovative healthy products that best meet
the taste and preferences of consumers of all ages, from
all walks of life, and in all moments of daily life. New
products launched in 2016 include Oishi “Kyoho Grape”,
as well as Oishi “Sakura Strawberry”, which featured
innovative packaging that changes color when chilled.
Meanwhile, Sermsuk launched est PLAY “Grape Berry”
and “Korean Orange Cola” to create a sensation in the
carbonated soft drink market. Sermsuk also expanded
the production base of “Crystal” drinking water, which
has been certified by NSF International, USA, as a quality
product with high standards. In addition, the design of
bottles used for “Crystal” drinking water was refreshed
to give the product a more modern look and use thinner
plastic.
Reach
Our robust and extensive distribution network is one of
our major strengths and also a key factor that elevated
ThaiBev to attain its leadership position in Thailand’s
beverage market. We currently have more than 7,000
delivery trucks which reach over 400,000 outlets across
the country, as well as long-standing relationships with
agents, distributors, and restaurants. We have also
established over 1,000 direct sales teams to provide
sales services and manage the visibility of our products
on store shelves. In 2013, we reinforced our domestic
distribution network by establishing Modern Trade
Management Co., Ltd. to distribute ThaiBev’s alcoholic
and non-alcoholic beverages to modern trade operators.
In 2014, we founded HORECA Management Co., Ltd.
(“HORECA”) to close gaps in our distribution channels
to luxury hotels and restaurants and provide us with
the benefits of complete coverage of the segment; and
to introduce our overseas premium products to the
upmarket on-premise segment in Thailand. In 2015,
we established Cash Van Management Co., Ltd. to manage
our direct sales teams, which support around 270,000
retailers across Thailand.
With our route-to-market and distribution strength
through HORECA, we were able to make our “Mekhong”
brown spirits available in more than 1,000 luxury hotels
and restaurants in 2016. Our premium spirits from
Scotland were also made available in more than 200
outlets nationwide.
Besides enhancing ThaiBev’s own distribution network,
we also always seek opportunities to collaborate with local
business alliances in ASEAN markets in order to solidify our
position as the leading full-scale beverage company
in the region and become a truly stable and sustainable
business.
Professionalism
One of the key aspects that drives the business towards
Vison 2020 is people. ThaiBev is determined to continue
building the team of each product group to have a variety of
skill sets and collaborate efficiently. This will be most
beneficial to the operation and enhance the potential of
the group in the long run.
In 2016, ThaiBev invested in workforce with knowledge
and competencies that enable them to be more capable
professionals and further develop their potential. For
example, we launched “Project Rocket” to groom talented
employees that are under 30 years of age and ready to be
devoloped towards future executives. Other projects were
scholarships to be enhance employees’ knowledge,
experiences, and competencies, and “Thailand-Scotland Staff
Exchange Programme” to give employees an opportunity to
gain overseas experience and exchange knowledge on spirits
production techniques so that they could further develop the
business for corporate success.
