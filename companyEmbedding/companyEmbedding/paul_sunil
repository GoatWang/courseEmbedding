Sunil Paul, Founder & CEO, Brightmail Inc. (Born in Punjab)












 $370 million in an all 
        cash deal for NRI's Spasm Company 

 
        Sunil Paul, Founder & CEO, Brightmail 
        Inc. (Born 
        in Punjab)
Spasm Guru
 
May 22, 2004
Early this week, computer security firm Symantec scooped up Brightmail 
        Inc. for a hefty $370 million in an all cash deal just when it was about 
        to go public. Industry experts say the Symantec-Brightmail deal, coming 
        alongside the Google IPO, points to a revival in the tech industry. 
 In 1997, When Paul's wife Michelle began complaining about the appearance 
        of spam junk mail in her America Online e-mail account, Sunil decided 
        to create a way for users to control their email.
 Brightmail, Inc. dedicated to giving users control of their email. Prior 
        to starting Brightmail, Sunil created FreeLoader, Inc., the first company 
        to offer a web-based push service. In 1996, Individual, Inc. acquired 
        Freeloader for $38 million, making it the best and second-best performing 
        investments in the VC portfolios of Euclid and Softbank, respectively. 
      
Before launching FreeLoader, Sunil was with America Online (AOL) as that 
        company's first Internet Product Manager, successfully creating most of 
        AOL's Internet capabilities. Before AOL, Sunil was a policy analyst at 
        the U.S. Congress' Office of Technology Assessment, where he specialized 
        in information technology and telecommunications, including the then-emerging 
        Internet. Prior to that, Sunil spent three years working on NASFreeLoader 
        specialized in a product designed to push information at you -- it was 
        a program that downloaded content from the Net while you weren't at your 
        computer. Brightmail, ironically, aims to do the exact opposite. Brightmail's 
        mandate is to fight spam -- to keep information you don't want from getting 
        into your computer by filtering it out of daily mail traffic. Paul's transition 
        from push to anti-push is a neat little metaphor for how our relationship 
        to the Internet has changed over the past few years, but that's not the 
        only reason we should pay attention to him. Internet start-up entrepreneurs 
        are a dime a dozen these days, and many of them come off as fairly wet 
        behind the ears, fresh from posh business schools where they seem to have 
        excelled mainly in courses that could have been titled "How to pitch 
        vaporware to a venture capitalist" or "Six easy ways to convince 
        the press to cover your company." Paul is young, still only 34 years 
        old, but already he has a track record of involvement with the commercialization 
        of the Net that few others can match.A's Space Station Information System. 
        Sunil has a B.E. in electrical engineering from Vanderbilt University.
Brightmail's software uses filters and other proprietary technologies 
        to block spam at the customer's Internet gateway, the point at which Internet 
        traffic enters the public network. The times are especially good for companies 
        dealing with computer security and spam. Recent estimates say about 40 
        per cent of all e-mail sent last year was spam, up from only 8 per cent 
        when Paul's wife first began complaining about it. 

Brightmail, Inc.

Biography: 
Born in Punjab, Paul was four when his family migrated to America in 
        1969 . He spent his early childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1987, 
        he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from Vanderbilt University, 
        Nashville. 
Buoyed by the news of the American space program, he moved to Washington 
        to work at NASA. But the experience was not very rewarding. "I regretted 
        taking up the job with NASA because I expected to do more engineering 
        work but ended up doing operational and maintenance work," he says. 
        From there, the restless Paul moved to a consulting firm that worked for 
        NASA and then joined a Congressional agency that gave advice on different 
        policy options. 
 

The Nemesis of Junk Mail
Shanthi Shankarkumar 
Of course, spam -- or junk e-mail -- is a waste of time and money. And 
        the most that most of us do is slowly destroy the delete key in annoyance. 
        And among the freshest of solutions in the market is Sunil Paul's brightmail.com. 
      
Brightmail Inc has advanced e-mail services and software to enhance the 
        quality and utility of e-mail. But its initial product, the Brightmail 
        Anti-Spam Service, fights unsolicited commercial e-mail. 
Sunil Paul's anti-spam program, launched in October 1997, covers nearly 
        35 million e-mail accounts provided by its 25 partners. 
Brightmail has formed technology and distribution partnerships with Netscape, 
        Sendmail and Software.com. Other partners include AT&T WorldNet Service, 
        Concentric Network, EarthLink, Excite, FastNet, FlashNet, Juno Online 
        Services and usa.net. 
Brightmail runs a 24-hour operation center where it identifies new and 
        existing spam and then forwards information about the spam to a "spam 
        wall" assigned to each user. The spam wall uses software to identify 
        and block spam messages before they reach a user's in-box, Paul says. 
      
Almost 50 per cent of e-mail users say they get spammed six or more times 
        a week, according to a recent study of 13,000 e-mail users commissioned 
        by Bright Light and conducted by the Gartner Group. Users want their ISPs 
        to protect them from spam, the study found. 
Paul, chief executive officer of Bright Mail, was inspired to develop 
        a better solution to the spam problem because his personal email accounts 
        were overrun by spam. 
What makes Brightmail effective? 
"The biggest difference is that it works. There are a number of 
        approaches out there that are able to stop 10 to 20 per cent of spam and 
        some proprietary approaches that stop up to 50 per cent. But nobody else 
        can match us for both effectiveness and accuracy. The big difference is 
        that we have got people and technology," says Paul. The fact that 
        the spam filtering is done at the ISP levels rather than the user level 
        makes the Brightmail service unique. 
So how does it work? 
"We basically set up large numbers of e-mail addresses all over 
        the net, those addresses are set up to receive spam and only spam. Those 
        addresses are forwarded to an operational center and there we have people 
        develop new techniques to stop any new spam attack. Those techniques or 
        rules are sent out to our customers. Spam is sent to a temporary holding 
        area where it is automatically deleted after a while," he says. 
"The world of policy warts and engineering geeks appealed to me," 
        he says, laughing. The Internet was a young domain then and Paul would 
        spend evenings after work exploring it. He eventually convinced the agency 
        to have a web browser put on every desktop -- those were the days when 
        Mosaic was the only web browser available. 
The world of government was too slow-paced for this man who liked to 
        leap his way through life. 
"After three years, I realized I was not cut out for the government. 
        I needed to get things done quickly and feel the impact of what I was 
        doing and not have to wait years to make a difference," he says. 
      
He then joined AOL, where, as an Internet product manager, he was responsible 
        for introducing Internet services to AOL. 
AOL's size made him worry if he could make the impact he was looking 
        for, but he need not have worried. 
"I definitely made a significant impact and helped contribute to 
        AOL's Internet strategy," he says. 
But a year later he was ready to enter a new phase in his work life. 
        He had a burning desire to be an entrepreneur and so joined up with a 
        friend to start a pioneering "push media" company, Freeloader. 
      
Paul has no regrets about leaving AOL. 
"I needed to have greater control over my destiny. It was as much 
        an emotional decision as a financial one. In fact, on a financial level 
        one might have done well just staying on," he says. 
Paul says he not only learned about the Internet at AOL but also the 
        company's "insane focus on the customer." 
He says he is amazed that no other ISP have been able to replicate this 
        single-minded focus on the customer. "They used to call it 'Steve's 
        phenomenon'. Every time anybody came up with a new idea, they'd ask, 'Would 
        Steve's mom be able to use it?' and if the answer is 'no', then the idea 
        died!" says Paul, with an admiring chuckle. Steve, of course, being 
        Steve Case, AOL's CEO. 
Of course, Paul also realized that he likes being the boss. 
"I don't want to work for someone," he said. " I have 
        great faith in my ability." 
Prior to starting Brightmail, Sunil created Freeloader, Inc, the first 
        company to offer a web-based push service. In 1996, Individual, Inc acquired 
        Freeloader for $ 38 million, making it the best and second-best performing 
        investments in the VC portfolios of Euclid and Softbank, respectively. 
      
Less than a year later, Freeloader closed down. But for Paul there was 
        no looking back. 
The money made from the sale would eventually lead to the starting of 
        Brightmail, which, ironically, keeps information away from your machine, 
        by filtering out spam from your mail. 
The Brightmail story has been celebrated in a number of magazine articles; 
        CNN too has run a feature on it. But Sunil Paul feels he has taken just 
        a handful of steps. 
"There are very significant announcements coming up. We are going 
        to roll out big customers," he says. 
"We are also planning to go into anti-virus and other products that 
        will make e-mail an indispensable tool. Money is not really the motivating 
        force. The real motivator is making a significant contribution to the 
        world before I leave it. I see a lot of things that can be improved." 
      

        The Problem's Getting Bigger: Sunil Paul
        Spam is costing the industry tens of millions of dollars a month in bandwidth, 
        customer service and systems administration. Between 15 to 30 per cent 
        of the average 14 million e -mail messages that America Online gets daily, 
        is spam. 
Most large Internet Service Providers have four to six people dedicated 
        to combating the problem. UCE (unsolicited commercial e-mail) or spam 
        costs these companies roughly $ 1 million each month, which works out 
        to $ 1-$ 2 per subscriber. A one-million-person ISP will typically lose 
        about $ 7.7 million a year because of spam. 
It is the odd economics of the Internet that created the junk e-mail 
        problem. Unlike a piece of paper mail which costs 25 cents to a dollar 
        to send, there is no per-message charge to send e-mail- it is included 
        in your monthly fee. All a spammer needs to send out a million messages 
        is a dial-up Internet account, a million e-mail addresses and a computer. 
      
"This is a problem that's only getting worse," said Paul who 
        launched Brightmail in July 1997 to fight spam. A survey has also found 
        that the amount of spam increases the longer you have an account with 
        an ISP. 
In the past the best way to protect yourself from being spammed was to 
        be very careful about disclosing your e-mail address. If you avoided putting 
        your e-mail address on a web page, if you did not participate in on-line 
        discussion groups or chat sessions, you were pretty safe. But hiding your 
        e-mail address is getting difficult by the day. More and more spammers 
        are sending e-mail to any address they think is valid. If the message 
        gets through, they are jubilant, if it doesn't they don't care. 
According to technology columnist Simon Garfinkel, the real spam problem 
        in the coming year will not be from fly-by-night operations and scam artists. 
        It will be from legitimate companies that view unsolicited bulk e-mail 
        as a way to market themselves more effectively. 
Another survey conducted earlier this year by Chooseyourmail.com has 
        shown that pornographers are responsible for 30.2 per cent of the spam 
        on the Internet today. There were two particularly disturbing aspects 
        of this kind of spam. Some of them were quite graphic in the description 
        of content being offered while many were very vague using ambiguous and 
        misleading text to disguise the true nature of solicitation. 
Just behind the sex sellers, 29.6 per cent of spam hawks get-rich-quick 
        and work-from-home schemes, many of them illegal. The remainder advertised 
        different products and services and a small percentage illegally offered 
        stock tips. 
Legislation and lawsuits don't deter spammers. Portals and ISPs have 
        fought spam with mixed success. AOL won a lawsuit in 1997 that prevented 
        one spammer, who offers striptease shows on the Internet from soliciting 
        AOL members. One of the frustrations is that it is increasingly difficult 
        to track down spammers. The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 50 
        per cent of spam is fraudulent, therefore 50 per cent is already illegal, 
        yet that has not stemmed the tide. 
State laws are already in effect, but they have not had any success in 
        stopping the spammers. Unlike telephone, fax and physical mail that have 
        been regulated successfully by law and agreements, e-mail has managed 
        to fall outside the jurisdiction of the law. 
"If a US law is passed, it will not help spammers in India and Belgium," 
        he said. 

Sunil Paul, CEO of Brightmail, explains 
        what it takes to be a two-time winner in the Internet economy.

        By Andrew Leonard
In June 1996, Sunil Paul and his partner Mark Pincus cleared $38 million 
        from the sale of their pioneering "push media" company, 
        FreeLoader. In a way, it was a seminal Internet moment -- FreeLoader wasn't 
        even a year old and had never generated a dime in profit, but little details 
        like that just didn't matter in the new economy of the Net. So what if 
        the stock price of the new parent company soon plunged, or if FreeLoader 
        itself was closed down less than a year later? For Sunil Paul, a one-time 
        Internet product manager for America Online, the experience was fruitful 
        -- and a springboard for his second venture, Brightmail.
FreeLoader specialized in a product designed to push information at you 
        -- it was a program that downloaded content from the Net while you weren't 
        at your computer. Brightmail, ironically, aims to do the exact opposite. 
        Brightmail's mandate is to fight spam -- to keep information you don't 
        want from getting into your computer by filtering it out of daily mail 
        traffic. Paul's transition from push to anti-push is a neat little metaphor 
        for how our relationship to the Internet has changed over the past few 
        years, but that's not the only reason we should pay attention to him. 
        Internet start-up entrepreneurs are a dime a dozen these days, and many 
        of them come off as fairly wet behind the ears, fresh from posh business 
        schools where they seem to have excelled mainly in courses that could 
        have been titled "How to pitch vaporware to a venture capitalist" 
        or "Six easy ways to convince the press to cover your company." 
        Paul is young, still only 34 years old, but already he has a track record 
        of involvement with the commercialization of the Net that few others can 
        match.
Which is not to say that his patter isn't as slick as the next CEO, business 
        school-trained or not. Paul started out as an electrical engineer, but 
        he speaks with the smooth confidence of someone who has honed his persuasive 
        skills through countless money-raising sessions and marketing campaigns. 
        If there's one theme that runs through both FreeLoader and Brightmail, 
        it's that Paul's companies know how to get press. The craze over push 
        media may be long gone and nearly forgotten, but it's hard to imagine 
        anything on the Net that aggravates the general public more than e-mail 
        spam. A company that fights the plague of junk e-mail is an obvious marketer's 
        dream -- Sunil Paul placed his second round of start-up cash on what looks 
        to be a pretty good horse. Last week, he talked with Salon Technology 
        about his experiences steering two companies through the fast-moving waters 
        of the Net.
Your career over the last five years has captured every up and down 
        in the Internet economy. What's it been like to be part of this thrill 
        ride?
It's definitely been a roller coaster. Everybody talks about how the 
        Internet bubble is going to burst, but the truth is that it has already 
        burst many times. It all came tumbling down in the fall of 1995 and also 
        in the fall of 1997.
And even before that. As far back as 1994, when you were at AOL, the 
        consensus of many people covering the Internet was that AOL was going 
        to get wiped out by the Net -- that AOL didn't get the Net at all.
I was on the inside thinking the same thing -- we've got to get our act 
        together! But we did -- AOL successfully incorporated the Internet into 
        what it was doing, and made it a clean and easy experience. Certainly 
        that was what I was advocating.
Why did you leave AOL?
I left because I had great ambition and desire to be an entrepreneur. 
        It was more of an emotional decision than it was a financial decision. 
        On the emotional criteria it was a huge success. On the financial side 
        it was probably a break even. I would have done very well if I'd stayed 
        there.
Push media seems such ancient history these days. Can you give me a sense 
        of how the competitive environment for an Internet start-up has changed 
        since those early days?
The noise level has gone up a huge factor. There are so many other companies 
        out there that are doing Internet-related things -- either existing companies 
        that are waking up to the realities of the Internet, or just other start-ups. 
        It used to be, when we started FreeLoader, that everything from getting 
        visibility in the press to getting visibility among prospective investors 
        or employers was easy. There just weren't as many Internet companies around. 
        That's maybe the downside.
But there's definitely some upside too: Everybody knows about the Internet 
        now; you no longer have to educate people about what e-mail is and what 
        it can do. That's a big advantage -- the story has moved from being one 
        that is kind of techie-focused to one that is a general consumer story 
        or a general business story. So, for example, in the case of spam, we 
        no longer have to pitch purely to the technical press. The general consumer 
        press is interested in the topic because it's something that affects almost 
        everyone.
When you started FreeLoader, you and your partner fit the classic 
        start-up entrepreneur scenario. You maxed out your credit cards, worked 
        out of your homes, and so on. What's it been like the second time around?
It's been a hell of a lot easier. You don't have to bang against the 
        credit limits of your credit card anymore. I think the big difference 
        is the ability to hit the ground running -- you don't have to worry about 
        going into debt, and you don't have to worry about immediately turning 
        around and raising money. I put several hundred thousand dollars into 
        the company in the beginning and I still had a number of people join me 
        early on who either worked without salary for a period of time for more 
        equity in the company, or at a reduced salary for a fairly long period 
        of time for, again, more equity. What that let me do was get the company 
        further along before having to raise money -- I was able to hold on to 
        it for a little bit longer than I would have been able to otherwise.
Are there specific lessons that you learned from FreeLoader that you 
        applied to Brightmail?
Yes. There's a technology lesson -- deploying and maintaining client 
        software [software that is installed on individual users' machines] is 
        really hard. There is also a lesson in the desirability of finding a real 
        problem, a real need, and satisfying it. Finding a need is a more straightforward 
        job than inventing a need. It's a tricky balancing act though, because 
        there's always a little bit of creation of need involved: At the same 
        as you address a new problem, you are creating new opportunities. Brightmail 
        is out to do both -- our initial products are aimed at solving a very 
        obvious problem. But future products will address the opportunities that 
        we create by solving that problem.
Can you talk more about those future products?
Unfortunately we're not really ready to talk right now about future products. 
        But they are all oriented toward improving e-mail, making e-mail a more 
        useful medium than it already is. The overall strategy of the company 
        is to introduce spam control and use that as a beginning for many other 
        services in the same way as other companies like Yahoo and Netscape and 
        Amazon used their first very simple product -- a directory, a browser, 
        book sales -- as a way to build up the market, build a brand name, build 
        awareness, and then layer other products on top of that.
You say that one of the things you've learned is that deploying client 
        software is really difficult. With Brightmail, you are primarily targeting 
        Internet service providers as customers for your software. Are ISPs a 
        big-enough market for striking it rich?
In the spam business? We know that spam is a real problem and it costs 
        a lot of money for ISPs and corporations. We estimate something like a 
        billion dollars a year is lost due to spam. A one-million-person ISP will 
        typically lose about $7.7 million a year because of spam. Is that opportunity 
        big? Yes. Is it capped? Yes also -- but between here and that capped opportunity 
        is a lot of revenue. We see an opportunity to go grab a pretty reasonable, 
        healthy stake of revenue, and create a core business big enough to build 
        a lot of relationships.
And then leverage those relationships with your new products?
Exactly.
One of your closest relationships is with Sendmail, the open-source software 
        company. Right now, your software is proprietary. Do you see any threat 
        from the open-source software development model, as far as Brightmail's 
        prospects are concerned? Could the open-source community develop its own 
        spam-control methods? 
That's an interesting question. It would take a massive coordination, 
        and while the Internet helps coordination in an asynchronous mode, its 
        pretty hard to do in a synchronous mode. Part of the value that open-source 
        software companies like Red Hat offer is that they add a layer of support 
        on top of this asynchronous coordination of writing software. Similarly, 
        what we basically do is that kind of support. We are the ones that are 
        accountable, we're the ones that are writing the spam-filtering "rules" 
        on a minute-by-minute basis -- and it's expensive to run a 24-7 operation 
        like ours. It would be pretty difficult to do what we do in an open-source 
        manner.
There's a saying in Silicon Valley these days that there is no shame 
        in being involved in a failed start-up -- on the contrary, I've heard 
        it said that venture capitalists look favorably on entrepreneurs who've 
        failed a few times -- they are supposed to have learned from their mistakes 
        and have a better idea of what it takes to succeed. It's hard to know 
        whether to call FreeLoader a success or failure -- you certainly picked 
        up a nice chunk of change, but the company itself was closed down and 
        the product doesn't exist. Did that help you or hurt you the second time 
        around? Is it true that failure looks good on a Silicon Valley résumé?
I don't know. It's true and it's untrue. I've heard people say that -- 
        but there's a difference to pay attention to. Did you try with gusto? 
        Or did you just whimper along? I see lots of companies and I interview 
        people who just sort of puttered along and didn't really go for it, and 
        I don't think anybody respects that. I guess if they end up being a big 
        success people respect that. But what people really like to see -- and 
        by people I mean investors and employees and people you're doing a joint 
        effort with -- is that you are willing to swing for the fences. If you 
        don't quite get there or if you struck out once before, that isn't necessarily 
        such a terrible sign.

She will try to pull...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?
