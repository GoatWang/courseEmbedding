Magic provides automated tools for the smooth migration of enterprise applications to a wide range of deployment channels.

Why Upgrade to Magic xpa
Migration How it Works
Benefits of Migrating with Magic


With the rise of smartphones, the BYOD trend and the need to support enterprise mobility, cloud and other business strategies, enterprises and ISVs are looking to upgrade their Magic eDeveloper and Magic uniPass apps to the highly versatile Magic xpa.
While your old Magic applications are still working on your old servers, today’s savvy mobile app users demand attractive mobile and desktop apps with intuitive user experiences and real-time performance that give them all the information they need to complete the task at hand. And the need to develop business apps for multiple operating systems is becoming a major issue.
Not to worry. Magic provides the ability to upgrade and migrate your apps to the latest Magic xpa version so you can preserve the business logic while upgrading the user experience and expanding your deployment options to include mobile, RIA and cloud.
Magic xpa’s single development paradigm maximizes your flexibility by enabling you to leverage one development effort to deploy your business applications the way you want, on the devices and operating systems you need: Mobile (smartphone, tablets), Full Client or Web; on-premise or on-demand; software or Software-as-a-Service; or global or local modes.
Magic xpa features a browser-free, business-centric and .NET-based client that combines the rich computational capacity and user experience of a "fat client" with the affordability of a "thin client."
Magic xpa allows Magic customers, application owners and ISVs to extend their service and product offerings to mobile, RIA and SaaS, while significantly lowering their application maintenance and delivery costs.
Why Magic xpa?
Fast time to market with low cost of ownership
Move from full client mode to mobile, RIA and SaaS based on single set of business logic without re-coding
Deploy unified solution across changing and heterogeneous environments
Browser-free technology avoids the limitations and complexities of browser environments
"Fit client" optimizes functionality and reduces costs
Focus on business logic rather than technology
Automatic conversion offers numerous advantages

Shorter time to market

Maximum accuracy reduces ongoing maintenance costs
Analysis reports identify inactive programs, unused operations, etc. that can be "cleaned up" to ease future maintenance

Magic offers a proven methodology and advanced set of 100% automated conversion tools that enable enterprises and software vendors to convert their existing applications from any earlier version of eDeveloper or uniPaaS to Magic xpa. This fully automated solution utilizes a dedicated engine that reads the Magic application and automatically generates converted code. 
 The conversion process comprises the following steps:
 Transfer of data by customer including the following items:        a. Removal of unused files and programs        b. Full Syntax checks (F8) resulting in no errors        c. Full application export        d. List of temporary tables        e. Application INI file         f. Application font and color files        g. Date files (for database conversion test)
 Conversion using automated tools
 Initial testing
Transfer of final products to client:        a. converted application        b. analysis reports        c. new color and font files
 Creation of test environment at customer site (client responsibility)
 Data conversion in test environment
 Bugs fixed by Magic (if necessary)

Magic Software Enterprises Ltd is a global enterprise software company headquartered in Or Yehuda, Israel. It is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select (NASDAQ: MGIC) and is also listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange TA-100 Index.[1]
History[edit]
Magic Software Enterprises was founded in 1983 by David Assia and Yaki Dunietz as a spin-off from "Mashov Computers",[2] a publicly traded Israeli company that provided business solutions on microcomputers. The new company was originally named "Mashov Software Export (MSE)", and developed software for the global market, specifically an application generator named Magic.
Mashov’s major innovation was a metadata-driven approach to programming that required no compiling or linking, and also allowed instantaneous debugging. The Magic platform was originally designed and developed by Jonathan (Yoni) Hashkes, along with Miko Hasson who was responsible for programme management. During the 1980s, the company grew based on its sales to the DOS and UNIX platforms. The product was used by many large organizations, including the Israel Defense Forces.
In 1991, the company changed its name to "Magic Software Enterprises" (retaining the acronym: MSE) and became the first Israeli software company to go public on the NASDAQ.[3][2] During this period the company developed a close relationship with IBM, focusing on AS/400 systems. In mid-1995, the first version of Magic for Windows was released.
In 1998, Magic was acquired by the Formula Group, headed by Dan Goldstein. In February 2000, it raised over $100 million and traded at a company valuation of $1 billion.
In 2001, Magic released "eDeveloper" (Rohan), a graphical, rules-based, and event-driven framework that offered a pre-compiled engine for database business tasks and a wide variety of generic runtime services and functions.
In February 2001, Menachem Hasfari replaced Jack Dunitz as CEO after a series of failures that led the company to post two successive profit warnings.[4]
In 2007, Guy Bernstein was appointed chairman of the board at Magic Software Enterprises, replacing David Assia. Prior to that, Bernstein had served as Chief Financial and Operations Officer of Magic Software since 1999. Guy Bernstein was appointed CEO of Magic Software Enterprises in April 2010.[5]
In 2003, Magic released the "iBOLT" integration platform. In July 2008, it released the first version of the "uniPaaS" application platform, replacing eDeveloper. In 2011, Magic released a .NET version of uniPaaS, and launched a new offering for enterprise mobility. In May 2012, Magic launched a company-wide rebranding, including new product names, a new logo and tagline. uniPaaS was renamed "Magic xpa Application Platform" and iBOLT was renamed "Magic xpi Integration Platform".[6] The Magic xpi Integration Platform was enhanced to include In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) technology from GigaSpaces.[7]
In 2016, Magic entered into an agreement to acquire a 60% equity interest in Roshtov Software Industries for $21 million with an option to acquire 100% of the equity in Roshtov, developer of the Clicks platform used in patient-file oriented software solutions for managed care and healthcare providers.[8]

You have a lot
invested in Magic/uniPaaS-based applications,
and Magic has been serving you well for
years. 

We know because we've been there,
and we've been absolutely certain that the
alternative of code-based programming - flexible as it may be, will slow you
down and likely leave you unable to deliver.


But what if you could have more...?

What if you could
leverage the most advanced programming tools and capabilities, tap into practically limitless
development resources, improve user satisfaction and lower TCO, all while maintaining and building on your
existing Magic assets and skillset. And what if you could
do all this at the same ease, familiarity and development speed you've always enjoyed?












Sounds crazy? It
isn't. 

With Firefly's proven
and 100% automated solution for risk-free Magic/uniPaaS-to-.NET migration, you'll get
pure .NET-based applications that are visually and functionally identical to
your originals, along with the tools and methodologies you need to even exceed the development
speed and efficiency you've grown so accustomed to. In fact, we'll make your move to .NET much
easier than upgrading to new versions of Magic.




Let's talk.
Our experienced Magic experts will
gladly bring you up to speed on this exciting opportunity to dramatically
improve your development. Contact us today for a free consultation or to schedule a
free trial to demonstrate
migration of your very own application to .NET.

                        Technical Description
                    






Destination Language and Converted Platform

                            The migration is to C# 4.5, adhering to the Microsoft.Net framework methodology, while using the progressive abilities of Net Framework 4 such as parallel programming, dynamic types, etc.                         
Access to Databases

                            Access to databases will be done using the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) layer, which enables data coupling between the data model – as is declared in the database - and its representation in the application.
Additionally, ORM enables flexibility in choosing the database provider (Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.).                         
Application Security

                            The application security in the new code is based on standard mechanisms available in the .Net Framework. An authentication mechanism for user identification will be implemented using Forms/Windows Authentication, depending on the system environment. Additionally, a Role Based Security mechanism will be implemented in relevant places, to create authorizations based on users and groups.  This mechanism is usually executed using standard Membership Provider, unless the client requests otherwise.

Magic Software Enterprises Ltd is a global enterprise software company headquartered in Or Yehuda, Israel. It is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select (NASDAQ: MGIC) and is also listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange TA-100 Index.[1]
History[edit]
Magic Software Enterprises was founded in 1983 by David Assia and Yaki Dunietz as a spin-off from "Mashov Computers",[2] a publicly traded Israeli company that provided business solutions on microcomputers. The new company was originally named "Mashov Software Export (MSE)", and developed software for the global market, specifically an application generator named Magic.
Mashov’s major innovation was a metadata-driven approach to programming that required no compiling or linking, and also allowed instantaneous debugging. The Magic platform was originally designed and developed by Jonathan (Yoni) Hashkes, along with Miko Hasson who was responsible for programme management. During the 1980s, the company grew based on its sales to the DOS and UNIX platforms. The product was used by many large organizations, including the Israel Defense Forces.
In 1991, the company changed its name to "Magic Software Enterprises" (retaining the acronym: MSE) and became the first Israeli software company to go public on the NASDAQ.[3][2] During this period the company developed a close relationship with IBM, focusing on AS/400 systems. In mid-1995, the first version of Magic for Windows was released.
In 1998, Magic was acquired by the Formula Group, headed by Dan Goldstein. In February 2000, it raised over $100 million and traded at a company valuation of $1 billion.
In 2001, Magic released "eDeveloper" (Rohan), a graphical, rules-based, and event-driven framework that offered a pre-compiled engine for database business tasks and a wide variety of generic runtime services and functions.
In February 2001, Menachem Hasfari replaced Jack Dunitz as CEO after a series of failures that led the company to post two successive profit warnings.[4]
In 2007, Guy Bernstein was appointed chairman of the board at Magic Software Enterprises, replacing David Assia. Prior to that, Bernstein had served as Chief Financial and Operations Officer of Magic Software since 1999. Guy Bernstein was appointed CEO of Magic Software Enterprises in April 2010.[5]
In 2003, Magic released the "iBOLT" integration platform. In July 2008, it released the first version of the "uniPaaS" application platform, replacing eDeveloper. In 2011, Magic released a .NET version of uniPaaS, and launched a new offering for enterprise mobility. In May 2012, Magic launched a company-wide rebranding, including new product names, a new logo and tagline. uniPaaS was renamed "Magic xpa Application Platform" and iBOLT was renamed "Magic xpi Integration Platform".[6] The Magic xpi Integration Platform was enhanced to include In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) technology from GigaSpaces.[7]
In 2016, Magic entered into an agreement to acquire a 60% equity interest in Roshtov Software Industries for $21 million with an option to acquire 100% of the equity in Roshtov, developer of the Clicks platform used in patient-file oriented software solutions for managed care and healthcare providers.[8]
