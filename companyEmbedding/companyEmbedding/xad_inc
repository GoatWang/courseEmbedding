Advertisements allow us to raise awareness, inform consumers, offer deals, and drive shoppers in store. As technology and consumer reliance on mobile grows, mobile advertisements are becoming more sophisticated and offering users value for interacting with the advertisements in the form of coupons, easy contact info, or local relevance.

GroundTruth Named a Snapchat Partner: Helping Advertisers with Location-Powered Experiences

In today's experience economy, it's more important than ever to be where your consumers are. With 79% of surveyed teens using Snapchat, the highest of any social media app according to Statistia, brands and marketers can no longer ignore its allure—they must be there too.
Snapchat's ephemeral nature makes it irresistible to its users: photos, videos, and messages that disappear by default rather than all remaining in curated form for the rest of the world to see. It's a reaction to the first generation of social media and an overt acknowledgement that in a digital world where everything seems unlimited, all that matters are the experiences we share. Snapchat has become the experience platform.
It's on this note that we're thrilled to announce that GroundTruth has been named a Snapchat Partner to make their Geofilters and Snap Ads available directly on GroundTruth's platform through Snapchat’s API.  As the world's consumers demand increasingly curated experiences, together we're providing the tools to be contextually relevant in a way that truly surprises and delights them.
To really understand the potential for this integration, let's explore the power of Snapchat's Geofilters and Snap Ads.
Geo-ust for fun
We'll start with the basics. Users can create, customize, and share Geofilters, which are images that overlay their photos and videos. Geofilters help explain the where, when, and why Snapchatters took a Snap.

Geofilters are a way for users to enhance their creativity, spread joy, and perpetuate memes. But businesses can create them too, and this is where Snapchat starts to dabble in augmented reality: their Geofilters allow businesses to create branded versions which include logos and images and make them available in a radius around a fixed location.
W hotels, for example, deploys them at its hotels to allow guest to share where they're staying without directly saying it. The W logo gets a free ride on users' Snaps, and users get to humble brag.
Let the video ads roll
And then, there are the Snapchat video ads called Snap Ads. Snapchat allows businesses to target full screen video ads at users.  GroundTruth enhances this by allowing advertisers to target unique users based on GroundTruth’s location profiles, which are then loaded through the Snapchat API. For example, a GroundTruth advertiser may want to target its branded videos at people who visited the music festival Coachella or to those who have shopped at a specific store recently. By leveraging the power of GroundTruth’s Location Audiences with Snapchat’s Audience Match technology, the targeting of those users with their corresponding Mobile IDs on Snapchat is now possible, and easier than ever.
Location, location, experience
GroundTruth clients can now access these powerful features directly through the GroundTruth platform and seamlessly make them available on Snapchat. There they can work with our team to create or upload designs, select broadcast areas, access GroundTruth’s custom Location Audience segments, and more. The potential for delighting customers is limitless and we're excited to see what our client partners come up with. Will they shock and awe customers with Snap Ads that are so relevant that they feel completely personalized? Will businesses create unique Geofilters and send consumers scouring far and wide to collect and share them? Time will have to tell.
What is certain, however, is that users crave the here-and-now. If businesses can meet them with clever, relevant, Geofilters and Snap Ads that enhance their experience, that economy will be theirs for the taking.

Did you know the average American eats out four to five times a week? That’s great news for restaurants –especially those who are interested in reaching consumers to increase visits to their business.
The first step towards reaching these consumers is understanding where and when they go out to eat. As a marketer, foot traffic trends reveal insight into how to engage your target audience and ultimately increase visits to your business.
After diving into our proprietary location data, we learned that night owls behave much differently than early birds. Here’s what we found:

Drive Parents In-Store Around Back to School Using Location-Defined Audiences

Back to School Means Back to Store
Did you know, U.S. consumers shop in-store for Back to School more than any other shopping occasion? Whether it’s so they can evaluate items in real life, spend time shopping with their child, or cash in on better sales and in-store rewards, 76% of U.S. parents prefer to shop in-store for Back to School, according to the 2016 eMarketer study, “Occasions/ Holidays for Which US Parent Internet Users Prefer to Shop In-Store.”
As a shopping season still dominated by physical store traffic, brands that are able to attract the right audiences into their brick and mortar locations have a huge advantage during the back to school season, which spans as early as June and can last past Labor Day. 
And once brands get the right shoppers in-store, they’ll benefit from the increase in overall spend, which was up across all back to school categories from 2015 to 2016.
But, driving people in-store isn’t easy, let alone attracting the right audience best suited for your specific brand or category. That’s why we broke down the broad audience for back to school shoppers - parents - into distinct groups based on the actual places they visit.
Location Indicates Intent and Drives Visitation Trends
Location is the strongest indicator of intent and the best way to define who someone is, so we use the places someone goes, overlaid with demographic data, to identify the most accurate audience segments for the Back to School timeframe. Here's an example of how we identify one of those segments: "Fit Moms"

Each audience we defined revealed distinct shopper behaviors and affinities, which allows brands to better align their targeting strategies and messaging to their ideal BTS audiences.
Here’s what we found based on xAd’s first-party visitation data of key Back to School audiences and at which types of store categories they over index. 

Reaching the Right Audience through Location Presents a Huge Opportunity for Marketers
As marketers, you can use specific audience segments, like the ones listed above, to inform your back to school strategy in 2017. 
Here are some Back to School strategy examples to activate using location and audience trends:

Brands often forget about Dads as a target audience for Back to School, even though they over index above Moms at office supply and coffee shops. With this in mind, Office Retailers could run a Back to School campaign aimed at encouraging Dads to spend quality time with their kids when shopping for school supplies and devices. 


“Big City Moms” and “Working Moms” over index above overall Moms at pharmacies. With this in mind, pharmacies could run campaigns to these two groups with messaging about the “busy parent” and promote their pharmacy as a one-stop-shop to get back to school supplies. 

Race to the School Bell 
As you prepare for the fast-approaching back to school season, be sure you understand your target audience on a granular level and how to reach them in the moments that matter.

How Mobile and Location-Based Advertising are Reinventing Out-of-Home

                                Posted by

At first glance, it might be hard to see the link between out-of-home (OOH) advertising and mobile. One is static, while the other's always moving. One has been around for hundreds of years, while the other is a modern invention.
When you think about it, though, these two marketing channels have a lot in common. Both leverage location to reach the right audience. Whether an ad takes the form of a billboard on a busy commuter highway or appears on a treadmill at the gym, OOH advertisers target consumers based on where they go and when, while mobile campaigns rely on foot traffic intelligence and location data to do the same.
In a way, out-of-home is the original location-based ad. And that makes mobile the perfect match for OOH campaigns.
Out-of-Home is Top of Mind for Brands
In 2016, OOH was the only traditional media category other than TV to see an increase in ad spending, according to eMarketer. As The New York Times reported last fall, billboard companies are "not only surviving — they're flourishing," with ad spending rising for 24 quarters straight.
The ongoing growth of OOH media is impossible to ignore. Active lifestyle marketing company Zoom Media now reaches consumers in 3,000 health clubs with digital signage in 160 markets across the US, while Captivate's lobby and elevator ads reach upwards of 10 million business professionals each month. Why the boom? Marketers recognize the value of this form of location-based advertising and the impact it stands to have on brand awareness and reach, and that's creating what MediaPost has referred to as an OOH advertising renaissance. Unlike the campaigns of old, though, OOH is now has a powerful ally: mobile.
Why Pairing OOH and Mobile is a Marketing Must
For a long time, mobile was perceived as a newfangled approach to marketing and the stuff of early adopters. Not so anymore. As we move from early to late majority adoption, brands can no longer overlook the importance of this technology and where it fits into their overall marketing plan.
EMarketer recently reported that mobile will represent 84 percent of digital ad spending in the US by the year 2021 compared with 16 percent for desktop, while spending on mobile ads is expected to grow by more than 34 percent this year.

Evolving consumer behavior plays a big part in the mobile and OOH marketing explosion. As the Times points out, consumers are spending more time out of the house, "partly because of an increase in travel and commuting and also because smartphones keep them connected when they are away from home or work." The more time consumers spend with their mobile devices out in the world, the more they're exposed to both mobile and OOH ads, and the greater the marketing opportunity becomes.
So how can brands maximize these highly compatible channels? With mobile marketing, and location-based ads in particular, we're able to understand who a customer is, where they've been, and what they're likely to do next. Marketers can even influence this last event by leveraging foot traffic trends to deliver a more personalized and relevant ad experience.
Imagine the potential of these ads when paired with OOH. We already use mobile to determine which locations are a good fit for our target audience — fast food chains, for example, can select which customers to target based on a combination of their proximity to a store location and the interests and needs demonstrated by their previous behavior. But OOH advertisers can also use mobile to inform them on the value of potential advertising locations by determining whether there are enough "fast food visitors" in the vicinity to justify a billboard. According to the Outdoor Advertising Association of American (OAAA), "With the help of smartphones…OOH can intercept consumers who are near or at the point of purchase like no other ad medium."
Mobile also has the ability to provide insight into other aspects of OOH strategy, like where potential customers are coming from, and how your ad placements influence their purchasing decisions. When you know that a large volume of visitors around your billboard are, say, from affluent neighborhoods, you're better able to create messaging that will resonate with them.
Mobile and Your Presence at Key Moments of Intent
The modern consumer can be described in two ways: on-the-go, and connected. Amazingly, Cisco reports that by the year 2021 more people worldwide will have a mobile phone than a bank account, running water, or a landline. As a result, consumers will rely more and more on their mobile devices, using them to navigate their world as well as fill it with what they need. Just consider last year's Cyber Monday activities. In 2016, American spent $205 million shopping on their smartphones, and mobile's share of Cyber Monday shopping is growing with each passing year.
All of this makes mobile a valuable marketing tool for measuring purchasing behavior and intent related to OOH campaigns, and the key to unlocking the mindset of the consumers cross-channel marketers hope to reach. Remember, what consumers tell brands and what they actually do isn't always consistent. That makes foot traffic data vital to following their movements in order to better meet their needs.
Out-of-home advertising may be thriving, but marketers are only just beginning to explore the role that mobile can play in creating more effective and efficient campaigns. Together, OOH and mobile are capable of taking location-based advertising to a whole new level.

Location Drives Marketers’ Shift from Demographic to Contextual Insights

Recent global events have proved how hard it is to predict outcomes. Consider President Trump and closer to home, Brexit. Heck, consider English football club underdog, Leicester City winning the Premier League last year. All events were against the odds, in all cases any expert relying on data to predict the outcome would have anticipated incorrectly. Why? Because people aren’t always willing to tell you everything; the decisions people make and the actions people take differ on their situation and mindset from day to day. 

Which leaves marketers in a bit of a conundrum. How do you create valuable experiences that account for and align well with unpredictable consumer behaviour? How do you measure and understand consumer habits? What is the value of demographic targeting in a world where intent is influenced on context?
We sought to answer some of these questions in our new report, conducted in partnership with ExchangeWire, “Digital Re-imagined: Context and Predictability”, and asked 207 digital marketing professionals to consider these points.
Key Learnings
What we uncovered was the use of location and contextual data was on the rise. Whilst ad requests containing location data rose by 170% last year, our survey revealed that 51% consider demographic segments to be of “limited use” or “no use”, with 38% of those who used contextual targeting doing so in order to break away from demographic stereotypes.
We also found that 43% of respondents believe contextual and location targeting will boost relevance of their ads, and 41% believe it’s main use is to drive footfall to physical locations. This is because location is one of the highest indicators of behavioural intent. My current situation, where I have been previously and what is in close proximity to me is more likely to determine what I find interesting and what I go onto buy than anything else. This is why 34% of respondents said real-time campaign activation is one of the main performance benefits they’ve seen from investing in contextual targeting, second only to campaign efficiency (47%).
So what does this mean?
Are we experiencing the demise of demographics? Quite frankly, no, that’s a massive over-exaggeration. But as consumer behaviour gets harder to predict, new technology is making it easier than ever before for brands to obtain a wider understanding of their audience. People have never fallen into straightforward demographics, and now we can build campaigns based on real behaviours and audience context. Location highlights intent as a visit to a store or specific place is often a larger commitment to purchasing compared to an online search or social share, and opens prime opportunities for brands to target audiences in the right moment based on where they are and the situation they are in.
With consumer behaviour more erratic than ever, the idea of spending months crafting overarching targeting for media campaigns is starting to seem outdated. Therefore, more efficient campaign planning and real-time activation are vital if marketers are to be as effective as possible in times of flux.

Mobile ad spending in the U.S. will more than double by the year 2021, according to marketing advisory firm BIA/Kelsey. At the same time, spending on location-targeted ads is expected to grow from about $12 billion to more than $32 billion.
There's no doubt that brands are ready to go all in with mobile. But is their mobile creative up to the task?
Even after years of experimentation, many marketers struggle to get their mobile display ads just right. The rules are different when you're designing for a mobile screen. For starters, there's no large canvas to help you make your ads jump off the page. Mobile requires that marketers consider everything from viewability to spacing and navigation. Users' attention spans are also plummeting, as noted by VentureBeat. Couple that with the fact that mobile behavior can be dramatically different from desktop, with mobile users multitasking, juggling numerous devices, and researching products on the move, and you've got a tricky proposition.
While designing effective mobile display banners is a unique process, recent data can help us master it. Here are three creative insights to help you design with the end user as priority.
Lighter Means Faster
As reported by Adweek, new research from Google and video technology company Teads shows that mobile video ads created using Google's AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) can significantly outperform traditional mobile ads. The faster ads were found to boost click-through rates by 200 percent.
This suggests that consumers have a more favorable outlook on ads that don't interfere with their mobile experience. But marketers have the cards stacked against them. Publishers always ensure their own content loads before the ads do — a smart tactic for increasing unique users and page views, but a big challenge for brands left with mere seconds to get their ads loaded on the page. Busy mobile users don't have the time or patience to wait for an ad to load, so when you're designing for the mobile device make your file sizes as small as possible and always aim for proper ad serving.
Keep Copy Short
How much ad copy is too much? This question has confounded digital advertisers for years, but we now know that when it comes to mobile, less is more.
xAd's Creative Insights report from 2016 revealed that mobile banners featuring copy comprised of fewer than 5 words received a 43 percent lift in click-through rate, so when you create your banner ad copy, keep your message short and to the point. Put all the attention on your offer, and cut unnecessary copy. Consumers should be able to glance at your ad and immediately get the gist, and eliminating your ad's background noise can help make your message crystal clear.
Animate to Engage
With mobile ads likely to run on multiple different sites and apps, it doesn't make sense to design for each publishing environment. Instead, create ads that catch users' attention on any publisher, against intended content.
One way to do this is with animation. According to xAd's Creative Insights, adding GIF animation — even if it's subtle — to mobile creative can improve click-through rates by 36 percent. The addition of animation will make users more likely to engage with your ad, while simultaneously differentiating your mobile creative from publisher content. Keep in mind, GIF animation isn't an excuse to add more copy; in fact, it requires an especially thoughtful approach. Every frame should be able to stand alone and feature your logo, call to action, etc., since you never know which frame a user will see while browsing. After all, studies have shown that consumers can spend less than 200 milliseconds looking at a mobile ad.
When armed with mobile creative best practices, marketers can ensure their mobile investment pays off. Be sure to subscribe to our blog for upcoming strategies on topics like crafting better mobile rich media ads and leveraging location data for your campaigns.

The Where of Wearables: Exploring the Potential of Wearables and Location-Based Marketing

Last year, Gartner reported that wearable technology needs to be more useful. With wearable abandonment rates hovering around 30 percent, the research company stressed the importance of creating more compelling value propositions.
eMarketer echoed similar sentiments when revising its previous growth estimates for wearable device usage. According to one of its analysts, "Without a clear use case for smart watches—which have more features than fitness trackers, but significant overlap with smartphone functionality—the more sophisticated, expensive [wearable] devices have not caught on as quickly."
The wearables market may be leveling off, but that hasn't changed the fact that this technology could be a game changer for brands. Those who are embracing it are doing exactly what Gartner and eMarketer are recommending, and making wearable tech more useful and functional for users. Commuters in the UK can now use their Apple Watches to find the nearest bus stop and plan their bus trips, and Android Wear smartwatch owners who are hungry for a slice can count on the Pizza Navigator app to point them to the nearest pizza place.
You can bet location technology will play a big part in wearables moving forward, too. Let's take a closer look at the wearable tech opportunity, and the role that location-aware messaging could play within it.
Omnipresence
Wearables go where their users do, and that makes this technology incredibly important to marketers. Consumers already recognize the value of geographically-relevant offerings. Pew Research Center has reported that 90 percent of U.S. smartphone owners use location services on their devices, and that number is on the rise.
We're likely to see marketers maximize wearables in similar ways to mobile-based advertising. When brands are always on hand to deliver location-specific messages that are useful to consumers—like maps to nearby retailers and information about current in-store product offers—they can create lasting and meaningful customer relationships.
Experience
Wearable devices like virtual reality headsets are already being used to create immersive brand experiences, and many of these take place on-site at festivals and in-stores. In Sweden, for example, McDonald's transformed limited edition Happy Meal boxes into virtual reality viewers that allowed children to play a VR game. In order to participate in this exclusive experience, though, consumers first had to visit a select McDonald's restaurant.
Imagine the location-aware activation possibilities. It won't be long before brands are leveraging VR to deliver location-specific ads or offers associated with their immersive video experiences. Interest in virtual and augmented reality is increasing, with consumer and media insights company Nielsen reporting nearly a quarter of Americans 18 to 54 expect to use or buy VR technology this year. The ability to combine location targeting with wearable technology to deliver entertaining and purposeful brand experiences is one that marketers aren't going to ignore.
Innovation
If there's one more aspect of wearables that marketers can really capitalize on, it's the technology's capacity for innovation. In the near future, industries like hospitality and travel will begin to experiment with wearable technology's unique functions, including haptics and vibrations. Marketers may soon be notifying consumers of location-specific retail offers in their area and nearby points of interest by vibrating their smartwatch.
Wearable tech is evolving and maturing with every passing day. Keep an eye on the unique opportunities that grow right along with it.

Industry Insights: Foot Traffic Actions Speak Louder Than Words for Resolutioners

                                Posted by

On January 1st, millions of consumers resolve that they'll turn a new leaf, kick their sugary vices, and return to the gym. According to Statistic Brain Research Institute, nearly 60 percent of Americans also claim to keep good on their resolutions, at least through the first month. But, xAd's foot traffic data reveals that consumer effort in keeping those resolutions declines after the third week in both the US and UK. Consumers, it seems, are a little less than truthful about maintaining their resolutions.

This is just one of the many findings from xAd's foot traffic analysis of consumers habits around resolutions. While insightful, it presents a bigger question to marketers: "Do people actually do what they say they're going to do?" Foot traffic data can help us gain a deeper understanding into this question; revealing that sometimes the answer is simply, no.
Below are three additional insights gleaned from xAd's foot traffic data, exposing new secrets around consumers and their habits:
It's Hard to Resist Guilty Pleasures - Especially for Our Friends Across the Pond

US consumers stay on target with their resolutions at least a week longer than UK consumers. But by the second week of January, UK consumers give into QSRs more so than their US counterparts and start to drop off from virtuous actions, like eating healthy and going to the gym.
US consumers are also 34 percent more driven than average to make virtuous changes within their lives during the third week of January, however, their behavior shifts shortly after that. By the last week in January, US enthusiasm for a healthier lifestyle begins to drop off by nearly 5 percent of visits to health-centric stores versus visits to fast food and liquor stores — just in time for the end of "Dry January" and the lead up to Super Bowl. By February 6, resolutions dropped an additional 8 percent.
There's Something About the Northeast

If a consumer lives in the Northeastern part of the US, they're much more hardcore about sticking to their goals. In a study about centenarians from the Boston University School of Medicine, the Northeastern states have the highest number of US citizens living over 100 years. None of the centenarians or super-centenarians (110 or more years old) were obese, or had a habit of smoking. What's more is that these centenarians were wide-ranging in socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and diet—though very few were eating hamburgers regularly or drinking alcoholic or sugary beverages.
The Midwest and the South Have Similar Habits

Consumers in the middle of the country and southern states have similar lifestyles, according to their foot traffic patterns. In nearly every week from mid-December to the end of January, consumers in the Midwest and South had roughly the same ratio of virtues to vices from week to week, within a few degrees. By contrast, the Northeast and the West, which were both healthier than the Midwest and Southern states, had a much larger differences between them.
So, what does this mean for marketers?
By the third week of January, it's time for gyms or health food stores to start re-incentivizing consumers to keep making healthy choices by offering new perks and/or sending positive campaign messages to keep up the spirit. The same can be said for QSR or retail marketers of liquor stores and supermarkets, who might be able to win people back consumers during this same time frame. Marketers should also be aware of region-specific habits and vices—it's likely that the same marketing in the Midwestern states won't appeal to the Northeast.

Just Released Foot Traffic Report Indicates Early 2017 QSR Trends

                                Posted by

While foot traffic data has been known to uncover real-world consumer insights, most don't realize how frequently it can align with actual brand performance and business trends—providing marketers with a deeper understanding into shopping behavior and future business success.
This is just one of the findings from xAd's just released QSR Foot Traffic report, which compares Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) foot traffic from Q3 to Q4 2016. Let's take a look at four of the QSR brands that experienced shifts in visitation this quarter and what our data tells us about recent and upcoming business events.
Exploring New Territory: Chick-fil-A
Topping the list is Chick-fil-A, which saw a 2.6 percent increase in foot traffic in Q4 of last year. In line with what Business Insider reported in October, Chick-fil-A has been generating more per-restaurant revenue than any other U.S. QSR chain.
Analysts chalk this up to recent expansions into the Midwest and Northeast, including high profile locations in New York City, and the introduction of healthy new menu items, such as grain bowls. If Chick-fil-A continues along this same path, the uptick in its foot traffic could be here to stay.
King of Meats: Arby's
Arby's is another fast-food brand that did relatively well in Q4, with an increase in foot traffic of nearly 1 percent. What accounts for the change? Arby's had a "meaty year" that put it several percentage points above the overall QSR industry in same-store sales growth. QSR Web notes that plans for more than 160 new locations, multiple new menu items, and a big improvement in QSR diner satisfaction all account for its recent foot traffic patterns.
The Comeback Kid: Chipotle
Chipotle Mexican Grill's Q4 0.5 percent foot traffic increase was another step in the right direction for the brand that has been slowly increasing throughout the year, as noted by xAd earlier in the year. A report from Reuters suggests that December's jump in sales was the high point of a disappointing quarter, but the chain is anticipating growth in 2017. The company plans to improve its customer service, unveil new menu items (including dessert!), and launch new digital ordering technology — all of which could boost foot traffic once more and help Chipotle leave its problems in the past.
Embracing The Future: McDonald's
Although it's usually a strong player, McDonald's didn't fare as well as usual in Q4. Interest in the chain's recently expanded All Day Breakfast menu is, according to Crain's Chicago Business, "waning," and domestic same-store sales dropped 1.3 percent last quarter.
While this shift is reflected in our data, which showed a simultaneous 1.4 percent decrease in foot traffic, don't count McDonald's out of the game. As noted by Crain's, while the brand is behind many of its competitors on the technology front — a fact that could be affecting its foot traffic as well — McDonald's is currently preparing to expand its "Experience of the Future" concept by introducing table service and self-serve ordering kiosks in all of its U.S. stores.

xAd, Inc. Key Developments

xAd, Inc. Launches Cost Per Visit Model
Mar 16 17
xAd, Inc. launched the pay-for-performance model for driving offline visits called Cost Per Visit. This solution is patent pending and third-party validated by location measurement firm, Placed and removes the risk or guesswork of traditional media buying. Now marketers have the option to only pay when in-store visits occur, allowing brands to maximize the power of mobile (understanding a user’s current and/or past location) to deliver right place, right time messaging. This new model represents a major shift in accountability from the buyer to partner solution, bringing improved transparency and accountability to the advertising industry. xAd’s Cost Per Visit solution relieves many pressures marketers face. By leveraging this model, xAd’s launch partners, The Home Depot and Applebee’s, will pilot a first-to-market solution built off the accuracy of xAd’s Blueprints technology, which precisely defines the geo-boundaries of businesses and points of interests. xAd’s Cost Per Visit model is patent pending and only available in the United States. Pricing and availability varies by industry.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
