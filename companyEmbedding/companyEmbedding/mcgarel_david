Biography

Slave-owner in British Guiana, patron of a British Conservative political dynasty, and philanthropist who shaped Larne in Northern Ireland. His entry in the ODNB as 'merchant and slave-owner' was published in 2016.
Charles McGarel has not been a well-known figure, does not appear in the large-scale studies of City of London and did not himself leave a physical imprint on London, but he did leave intangible legacies within it and physical ones and intangible ones beyond it. London appears to have performed a limited function for him, as the locus of wealth-accumulation: and having made his money, he chose to leave his mark elsewhere; at the same time, inevitably his legacies also appear indirectly in London, the city of his activity as merchant and financier as well as one of his two homes for 50 years.
Charles McGarel was born around 1788 in Larne in Northern Ireland, the son of a local innkeeper or cobbler. As a young man, he went with at least two of his brothers to what was then Demerara on the coast of South America, at a time when British capital and British emigrants were penetrating the Dutch possessions of Demerara, Berbice and Essequibo (now Guyana,previously British Guiana, their colonial name after 1831 until 1966). These Dutch possessions were captured in 1796 and again in 1803: they formally became British colonies only in 1814. This was a sugar frontier, highly expansive and highly profitable, hungry for new slaves despite the ban on the African slave trade in 1807, to which the three colonies were subject. (One reason for that hunger for new slaves was the very high rate of mortality of the enslaved in the new sugar territories: for a number of years, enslaved people to fill the gaps were brought from other British colonies in the Caribbean under license, although these movements were increasingly restricted from 1825 onwards). McGarel (or possibly one of his brothers) appears by 1808 to have become a partner in the local merchant firm of Johnson, Dyett, McGarel and Co. of Stabroek (known as Georgetown after 1812), when it is shown importing supplies and consumer goods from Britain for sale to local residents. The Essequebo and Demerary Royal Gazette shows McGarel there still in the 1811-1816 period. In 1812, for example, he became Treasurer of the Committee for Quarterly Balls, and in 1816 he and his brother Peter are recorded acting as attorneys for an absentee slave-owner, Thomas Naghten.  
By 1820, McGarel had moved to London. His firm of Hall, McGarel first appears in the trade directories in that year, at 7 Austin Friars (it later moved at the time of the compensation process in the mid-1830s to 32 Fenchurch Street). Hall, McGarel had evolved from a firm at the same Austin Friars address named Underwood Hall & Co., which in turn had evolved from an earlier firm called Underwood Dyett. The founders of Underwood Dyett appear to have been men whom McGarel knew or with whom he was connected in British Guiana (Dyett had been a local partner of McGarel in Demerara). The Hall partners were in the firm were Alexander and David Hall. The London Gazette shows in 1834 the dissolution of Hall McGarel with the departure of Alexander Hall, and its continuation by two of the three previous partners, David Hall and Charles McGarel. David Hall was originally from Barbados, married there in 1811, retained his ownership of slaves there but at some point shortly after his marriage came to London (his wife died here in 1823) and joined the Underwood Dyett firm as a partner. Presumably Alexander was either David’s brother or his father.
Hall McGarel and its predecessor firms were West Indian merchants focused on British Guiana. The firm apparently acted as London agent for estates in British Guiana: it appears for example in the Boulton & Watt papers in the 1830s, just as Underwood Dyett and Underwood, Hall had in the 1810s. The firm also extended credit to slave-owners in the colony, for example entering into a mortgage of £30,000 on the Reliance estate in Essequibo in March 1829. McGarel, Alexander Hall and David Hall were among the 65 absentee slave-owners and mortgagees petitioning the Privy Council in 1826 against compulsory manumission in Demerara and Berbice.  McGarel served on the Committee of five appointed to pursue the appeal, which was heard in July 1827 and appears to have stalemated the British government’s efforts to enforce compulsory manumission.    
In the 1830s, the partners in Hall, McGarel were some of the major beneficiaries of slave compensation. They were the mortgagees on the Endragt and Mon Repos estates and the 456 enslaved people upon them, and received £22846 1s 1d in December 1836. Again as mortgagees, they received £7300 3s 10d for 135 enslaved on Philadelphia estate. Charles McGarel and David Hall, the two partners, owned together with Alexander Hall the Hamburg estate on Tiger Island with 329 enslaved, and received £17110 13s 6d in compensation for those people in January 1836; and they had a smaller award for £856 5s 6d for 16 enslaved at Cumings Lodge. Charles McGarel personally (i.e. outside the framework of the Hall, McGarel firm) with his brothers owned the Uniform estate and the 253 enslaved on it, for which he and John and Peter McGarel were awarded £13417 15s 7d in January 1836; in addition, Charles McGarel was the sole awardee of £9751 6s 5d for 184 slaves on Nouvelle Flandres, and had two additional small awards in his own name. McGarel also appears as a co-awardee of three big claims for 1100 enslaved totalling £60,000, but here we believe he was acting as executor for one of the former owners (Thomas Naghten, for whom McGarel acted as attorney when he [McGarel] was in Demerara in the early 1800s and who reappears in this narrative below) rather than as beneficiary. Peter and John McGarel also were awarded almost £10,000 for the enslaved on the Bank Hall estate in British Guiana. David Hall also collected compensation in his own name, about £5000, for enslaved people in Barbados on his estate Locust Hall, and he appears in an unknown capacity with John Fullarton as co-awardees on a large claim for 239 slaves on the Ma Retraite estate in British Guiana. So in total the partners received almost £100,000 (omitting the £60,000 where McGarel was executor), a huge amount in the context of the day. There were at least two additional cases of ‘mercantile interception’ where Hall and McGarel counterclaimed as mortgagees on the Reliance estate of Donald Mackay (although the award of £24288 7s 0d for 467 slaves is shown in Mackay’s name) and on the Richmond Hill estate of Laurence Fitzgerald, where again the award of £3535 12s 8d was made in Fitzgerald’s name. In both cases, the compensation was probably shared with Hall McGarel.
The firm of Hall McGarel was dissolved on 1st January 1842, a few years after the compensation process , when its partners were shown as David Hall, Charles McGarel and Alexander Hall Hall, the latter being the son of David Hall. David Hall lived at 44 Portland Place in the late 1830s, although he died in 1844 at 10 Park Street (he had also bought in 1822 the Botleys Park estate in Surrey, which he later sold to another slave-owner, John Beckles Hyndman).   David Hall left £200,000 in personalty (i.e. not including the value of any real property, i.e. land), a fortune that made him one of the richest people dying in Britain that year. His son, Alexander Hall Hall, who had been educated at Eton and Balliol appears to have dropped from commerce after his father’s retirement in 1842, and was appointed as Deputy-Lieutenant of Sussex in 1860. He died at Watergate House near Emsworth Hampshire in 1874, having made the transition from his father’s slave-owning to English landed gentleman and county society.
Charles McGarel himself does not appear again as a merchant after the 1840 P.O. directory but he continued as an absentee owner of estates in British Guiana. In 1860 he is shown as the owner of two estates, Blenheim and Caledonia. Blenheim had belonged to an absentee slave-owner called Tully Higgins, one of whose executors was McGarel’s former partner Alexander Hall. McGarel lived at 14 Wimpole Street from at least 1824 to 1855, but then moved to the more plutocratic 2 Belgrave Square in the late 1850s and that remained his London home until his death in the 1870s. He was active in a number of diverse financial areas of the City after the early 1840s. For example, he became Chairman of the Committee of Mexican Bondholders in one of the periodic upheavals in international bond markets in the mid-1850s; he was also a director of the Colonial Bank. He invested in industry: this is a classic confirmation of Williams’ thesis that profits from slavery (not just the slave-trade) fed Britain’s industrial revolution. McGarel was one of the major investors in the Maesteg iron industry alongside a fellow slave-owner and West India merchant James Cavan, subscribing £10,000 to the Llynvi Iron Company in 1845 and increasing the investment to £12,500 in its restructuring as the Llynvi Vale Iron Co. in 1853. McGarel also subscribed in the railway boom: £4000 to the London & Brighton Railway in 1837, and much larger amounts in the mid-1840s: £45,000 to the London, Chatham and North Kent line and £5,000 to the Edinburgh & Northern in 1845, and a further £27,500 to the North Kent and £5,000 to the British & Irish Union in 1846. As an aside, his brother Peter was also a railway investor subscribing £5000 to the Belfast & Ballymena line in 1845. Charles McGarel flirted with a political career, being put forward by the Conservatives for Worcester in the May 1852 by-election, but ‘as he was not explicit on the subject of “Protection”, he found so little favour with the voters that after fours days’ canvassing he left the city’. He died a very wealthy man in 1876, leaving personalty of £500,000, making him in turn one of the richest men in Britain dying that year.
The impact of this slave-owner might therefore appear predictable if a little diffuse. His wealth clearly was made from slavery, and equally clearly it flowed into and helped the development of the City as a financial centre in the 19th century. Incontrovertibly, his slave-wealth (including compensation) became capital in the transformation of manufacturing and transportation in Britain. There can be legitimate debate about how important were McGarel and his fellow-slave-owners in aggregate to 19th century business and the British economy: but the individual impacts are or can be made visible, as with McGarel, and can slowly be pieced together.
But there are legacies well beyond the commercial and industrial, and for McGarel there are three other things we want to bring forward, to illustrate both the extent and limitations of the legacies of slave-ownership.
First is his impact in Larne, which was his home town. With his wealth, McGarel bought land and an estate at Magheramorne near Larne in 1842 (beginning perhaps to make a transition from full-time merchant to more passive financier and rentier). He clearly spent time there, away from London. The philanthropist and antislavery activist Samuel Gurney, for example, met McGarel by chance there on Gurney’s celebrated tour of post-famine Ireland in autumn 1849 and rekindled an old acquaintance: the two men shared an interest in the National Schools system, which McGarel funded in Larne. And McGarel endowed buildings: in Larne the Town Hall is known as the McGarel Town Hall, funded by McGarel and built in 1869; there is a McGarel cemetery (on land he donated in 1862), and there are McGarel almshouses (built in 1875).   In 2004 a plaque was installed commemorating him as a benefactor. It is understood in Larne that his wealth derived from Demerara and the sugar trade, but as is often the case the role of slavery is not visible in the short-hand histories of his wealth deployed locally.
So, firstly, his legacy is in Larne’s physical fabric. Secondly, there is the impact of his transmission of his slave-wealth on his death, his legacy in the literal sense.   In April 1856, Charles McGarel had married (he was then well over 60); his wife was Mary Rosina Hogg, the daughter of Sir James Weir Hogg (MP and Chairman of the East India Co.) and the sister of, among others, James MacNaughten Hogg, the MP and Chief of the Metropolitan Board of Works in London between 1870-1889, and progenitor of the Blackwall Tunnel. The McGarels had no children and on his death, McGarel left his estate at Magheramorne to his brother-in-law the MP, on condition that the latter changed his name to James McGarel Hogg, which of course Hogg did.   One of the first things he did with his inheritance was to build a new house between 1878 and 1880, Magheramorne House. McGarel Hogg, who was himself married to the daughter of 1st Baron Penrhyn, another slave-owning family (in Jamaica this time) later became 1st Baron Magheramorne. However, the 2nd Baron married the daughter of the Earl of Shaftesbury, squandered the family fortune and died bankrupt around 1903: the title itself continued for a few more decades, but the money was gone. The financial legacy of slavery can therefore sometimes be ephemeral.
But McGarel also had a second brother-in-law whose life and career he substantially shaped, Quintin Hogg. Hogg was a generation younger than McGarel, having left Eton in 1863 and gone into the City for an unhappy 18 month spell with a firm of tea-merchants. McGarel engineered the entry of Hogg into the firm of Bosanquet Naghten. McGarel was not a name partner of Bosanquet Naghten or the firms that evolved from it but it seems to be the successor firm of Hall McGarel, appearing at the same address at 32 Fenchurch Street from the 1845 P.O directory onwards. Its partners were the East Indian man Augustus Henry Bosanquet and his son Percival (both intermarried with the Bevan banking family) and Thomas Naghten, whom we believe to have been the Thomas Naghten who was McGarel’s attorney in British Guiana in 1842 and was himself the son of the former absentee British Guiana slave-owner for whom Charles McGarel and his brother Peter had acted as attorney in the early 1800s. It is clear from Ellen Hogg’s biography of Quintin Hogg that McGarel was the eminence grise of the firm, what today would probably be called a shadow director: she states that McGarel found Hogg a place in ‘his firm’. How much if any of his capital he left in is unclear. [Walter Rodney 'Guyanese Sugar plantations' closely links M'Garel and Hogg e.g. Footnote 3 page 85 sale of Devonshire Castle by 'McGarel & Hogg'; page 19 'Mr Hogg (acting for the late Mr McGarel and Mr Campbell) in amalgamating estates into Reliance; Footnote 21 page 87 'Charles McGarel (of Curtis & Campbell)']. But with the platform of McGarel’s sponsorship and of his commercial networks, Hogg rose rapidly. Hogg stayed with this firm for the rest of the century (he retired in 1898), as it transformed itself into Bosanquet Curtis and then Hogg Curtis Campbell, one of the leading firms in the London sugar market with continuous involvement in the Demerara sugar industry, as well as acquiring through defaults estates in Jamaica and Ceylon. The firm remained independent until 1939 when it merged with Booker McConnell. Later in life, Hogg re-founded and moulded the Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster). His son was Douglas McGarel Hogg (1872-1950), 1st Viscount Hailsham, Lord Chancellor in the late 1920s and again in the later 1930s, and secretary of State for War in the early 1930s. Quintin Hogg’s grandson, also Quintin Hogg, Lord Hailsham, was a Tory politician and the Lord Chancellor in Ted Heath’s and Margaret Thatcher’s governments, between 1970-1974 and 1979-1987. Lord Hailsham’s full name was Quintin McGarel Hogg. Lord Hailsham’s son in turn was Douglas Hogg, the former MP and agriculture minister. McGarel’s sponsorship of Quntin Hogg led to the foundation of a Tory dynasty that until this generation actually carried McGarel’s name.

                A1            













Abstract:

            Methods and systems for selecting and weighting securities for an actively managed exchange-traded fund. An initial selection of stocks includes domestic or international stocks, which are selected based at least in part on market capitalization. Each stock is scored using a plurality of growth and value factors to generate one or more growth scores and one or more value scores. A selection score is determined for each stock, and the stocks are ranked according to selection scores. A predetermined amount of stocks are eliminated from the stock portfolio based on selection score ranking, and the remaining stocks are split into a plurality of sub-groups. A stock portfolio is generated by weighting the remaining stocks according to the sub-groups they are in, with each stock being equally weighted within its sub-group. An exchange-traded fund is offered to consumers based on the stock portfolio.

Description:

RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/020,667, filed Jan. 11, 2008. The content of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/020,667 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe presently described technology generally relates to the selection and weighting of securities for investment portfolios, and more specifically to methods for selecting and weighting stocks for actively managed exchange-traded funds.Conventional Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded FundsAs compared to individual securities, mutual funds (such as stock funds) that include many holdings have the advantage of providing the fund owner with diversification of assets, which tends to lessen volatility and the risk of a large loss. However, conventional mutual funds do not offer intraday liquidity like individual securities and cannot be actively bought and sold on an exchange throughout the course of a trading day. This limitation was addressed by the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs, which must be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, allow investors to buy and sell (and short sell) equity interests in a “basket” of securities on an intraday basis, in the same manner as individually listed securities.Index-Based ETFs and Actively Managed ETFsMarket indexes are generally designed to measure the aggregate performance of a group of financial instruments, such as securities (e.g., stocks and bonds) or futures contracts. Generation of a market index typically involves selecting financial instruments based on a set of selection criteria, then weighting those instruments based on a weighting scheme. Selection criteria for an equity index, for example, may include a combination of stock characteristics such as market capitalization, whether the stock is domestic or international, and growth and value factors. Weighting schemes may likewise be based on various characteristics of the securities, or may simply accord equal weight to all securities selected for the index. “Weighting,” as used herein, refers to a method of assigning a proportionate value to securities within a given index or fund.Some market indexes are commercially available. Commercially available indexes are maintained and published by providers such as Standard & Poor's (e.g., the Standard & Poor's 500 index, or “S&P 500”) and Dow Jones & Company (e.g., the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or “DJIA”). Investment companies may offer investors shares of “index-based ETFs” with holdings and allocations that correspond closely to a particular commercially available index. In all cases, index-based ETFs seek investment results that simply attempt to “track” a commercially available index such as the S&P 500 or the DJIA. Tracking can be achieved, for example, by replication or representative sampling of the index's securities in the index-based ETF. More recently, some indexes have gone from broad representation of a market segment to more narrowly focused and alpha-seeking indexes. “Alpha” is an indication of how much an investment outperforms (positive alpha) or underperforms (negative alpha) a benchmark index.Investment companies may also offer investors shares of “actively managed” ETFs. Generally, a fund is actively managed if it does not seek to track the performance of a particular commercially available index. Actively managed ETFs thus do not attempt to track a particular index, but instead use their own, independent selection and weighting strategies in an attempt to outperform a selected benchmark. The selection and weighting strategy of an actively managed ETF may be a fixed and repeatable set of steps, a more subjective process involving the fund manager, or a combination of both. Therefore, an ETF may be considered “actively managed” even if the holdings in the underlying investment portfolio are selected and weighted based on fixed, repeatable algorithms that require no human input. Conversely, an ETF is considered to be “index-based” even if it does not precisely mirror the holdings and allocations of a particular index, so long as it seeks investment results that track or enhance the performance of the index.Although their expense ratios may be higher, actively managed ETFs can have certain advantages over index-based ETFs. For example, active management may allow better control of the balance between volatility and risk in a portfolio. As another example, active management may allow better control of the degree of diversification in a portfolio. And depending on the degree of one's belief in the “efficient market theory,” actively managed funds may enable a portfolio to focus on market segments that are more likely to outperform the general market.Previously, only index-based ETFs have been available and approved for public offering by the SEC. Available index-based ETFs have included SPDR Trust Series 1 (“SPY”), based on the S&P 500 Index, and iShares Russell 3000 Index Fund (“IWV”), based on the Russell 3000 Index.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides computer-implemented methods for selecting and weighting stocks of a portfolio for an actively managed exchange-traded fund (ETF).One embodiment of the invention provides a method for selecting and weighting securities for an actively managed exchange-traded fund using a computer system. Information of an initial selection of securities is input into a database, wherein the information includes identity, growth data and value data of each stock in the initial selection of securities as of a selection date, wherein the initial selection of securities consists of one of domestic stocks and international stocks, and wherein the initial selection of securities is selected based at least in part on market capitalization. In some embodiments, the initial selection of securities is selected from a group consisting of the 200 largest domestic stocks based on market capitalization and the 200 largest international stocks based on market capitalization.Each stock in the database is scored using a plurality of growth and value factors to generate one or more growth scores and one or more value scores for each stock. In some embodiments, the plurality of growth factors comprise, or are selected from the group consisting of, price appreciations, 1-year sales growth and price-to-sales ratio, and the plurality of value factors comprise, or are selected from the group consisting of, price-to-book ratio, price-to-cash flow ratio and return on assets. In some embodiments the step of scoring each stock includes assigning a growth rank to each stock for each growth factor, assigning a value rank to each stock for each value factor, summing up all growth ranks of each stock to generate a raw growth score for each stock, ranking the stocks based on raw growth scores, summing up all value ranks of each stock to generate a raw value score for each stock, and ranking the stocks based on raw value scores.A selection score is determined for each stock. In some embodiments, the selection score of each stock is equal to the better of its rank based on its raw growth score and its rank based on its raw value score. In some embodiments, the selection score of each stock is set equal to the better of a final growth score and a final value score, wherein the final growth scores are based on the raw growth score ranks and a quantitative style overlay, and wherein the final value scores are based on the raw value score ranks and the quantitative style overlay.The stocks in the initial selection of securities are ranked based at least in part on selection scores, and a predetermined amount of the lowest ranking stocks are eliminated. In some embodiments, the predetermined amount of the lowest ranking stocks to be eliminated is the bottom 25%. The remaining stocks are divided into a plurality of sub-groups. In some embodiments, the remaining stocks are divided into sub-groups based on at least one of raw growth ranks, raw value ranks and selection score ranks. A stock portfolio is generated by weighting the remaining stocks according to the sub-groups they are in, wherein each stock is equally weighted within its sub-group. In some embodiments, the sub-groups are quintiles based on at least one of raw growth ranks, raw value ranks and selection score ranks. The top ranked quintile of remaining stocks may receive 5/15 of the weight within the stock portfolio, with successive quintiles of remaining stocks receiving 4/15, 3/15, 2/15 and 1/15 of the weight within the stock portfolio, respectively.An exchange-traded fund is offered to consumers based on the stock portfolio. In some embodiments, the stocks in the stock portfolio are reconstituted and rebalanced periodically.Another embodiment of the invention provides a computing system for selecting and weighting securities for an actively managed exchange-traded fund, the computing system comprising a processor and a memory storing a set of instructions adapted to be executed by the processor. The set of instructions is arranged to store information of an initial selection of securities in a database, wherein the information comprises identity, growth data, and value data of each stock in the initial selection of securities as of a selection date, wherein the initial selection of securities consists of one of domestic stocks and international stocks, and wherein the initial selection of securities is selected based at least in part on market capitalization.The set of instructions is also arranged to score each of the stocks in said database using a plurality of growth and value factors to generate one or more growth scores and one or more value scores for each stock. In some embodiments, the plurality of growth factors are selected from the group consisting of price appreciations, 1-year sales growth and price-to-sales ratio, and wherein the plurality of value factors are selected from the group consisting of price-to-book ratio, price-to-cash flow ratio and return on assets. In some embodiments, the set of instructions is further arranged to assign a growth rank to each stock for each growth factor, assign a value rank to each stock for each value factor, sum up all growth ranks of each stock to generate a raw growth score for each stock, rank the stocks based on raw growth scores, sum up all value ranks of each stock to generate a raw value score for each stock, and rank the stocks based on raw value scores.The set of instructions is also arranged to determine a selection score for each stock. In some embodiments, the selection score of each stock is set equal to the better of its raw growth score rank and its raw value score rank. In some embodiments, the selection score of each stock is set equal to the better of its final growth score and its final value score, wherein the final growth scores are based on the raw growth score ranks and a quantitative style overlay, and wherein the final value scores are based on the raw value score ranks and the quantitative style overlay.The set of instructions is also arranged to rank the stocks in the initial selection of securities based at least in part on selection scores, to eliminate a predetermined amount of the lowest ranking stocks, and to divide the remaining stocks into a plurality of sub-groups.The set of instructions is also arranged to generate a stock portfolio by weighting the remaining stocks according to the sub-groups they are in, wherein each stock is equally weighted within its sub-group.A method and computer system of the present invention consistently identifies and selects stocks from an initial selection of stocks. The invention identifies stocks within the initial selection of stocks that provide heightened potential for capital appreciation. In accordance with at least one embodiment, the presently described technology is itself inherently passive. In accordance with this embodiment, no active judgment is made when the method or the computing system is evaluating stocks, and each step in the process is driven by a transparent, repeatable quantitative process.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 is a block diagram of a structure embodiment according to the present invention.FIG. 2 is a schematic flow chart depicting the program flow of a software application in the structure of FIG. 1, according to one embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 3 is a schematic flow chart depicting the program flow of a software application in the structure of FIG. 1, according to a more specific embodiment of the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Various exemplary embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes. Other components and configurations may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.The presently described embodiments relate to portfolio construction and management for an actively managed ETF. Embodiments of the present technology include methods and computer systems for generating stock portfolios for an actively managed ETF using a plurality of growth factors and a plurality of value factors to rank each stock.Referring now to FIG. 1, a securities database 150 receives and stores data using a computing system 100 (e.g., a conventional personal computer standing alone or connected to a server (not shown)). Computing system 100 comprises at least a processor 120 and a memory 140. Memory 140 stores both securities database 150 and a computer software application 160. Computer software application 160 comprises a plurality of instruction routines 170, which are executed by processor 120 to carry out particular steps in the method of the presently described technology. Processor 120 may be contained within a single computer system such as system 100, or distributed among multiple computer systems. Likewise, database 150 may be contained within a single computer system such as system 100, or distributed among multiple computer systems.Data may be manually entered into database 150 via (1) keyboard 190, which is operatively connected to processor 120, (2) downloaded from an internet server (not shown), or (3) transferred from a local storage medium (not shown), for example. The data which is input to and stored in database 150 may include the names of, or a representation of, an initial selection of stocks, such as stocks selected by one or more fund managers.For example, the largest 200 domestic stocks can be stored in database 150. As another example, the largest 200 international stocks can be stored in database 150. As used in this specification, “domestic stocks” are stocks of companies listed on a U.S. exchange that are domiciled in the U.S., U.S. territories or possessions, or in certain tax havens such as Cayman Islands and Bermuda. “International stocks” are those stocks that are not domestic stocks. A data entry person can make use of a table 180, or the like, to key-in the data using keyboard 190, i.e. data entered by keyboard 190 is obtained by processor 120 and loaded into database 150. Table 180 includes a listing 182 of each of the entered stocks. Alternatively, the data may be downloaded into database 150 from another server or memory, or from a feed stream directly transmitted from a provider such as Standard & Poor's, for example.The database 150 can store information identifying each stock it contains, such as the name and/or symbol of the stock. Other data relating to each stock as of the close on a selection date can also be entered and stored in database 150 in association with its respective stock name and/or symbol. Such other data may be taken from table 180, or the like, and includes growth data represented by a set of growth factors 184 and value data represented by a set of value factors 186 for each stock. Again, the data entry person may make use of table 180 to key-in the other data so as to store the other data in database 150, or such other data may be downloaded to database 150 for storage.In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present technology, the growth factors 184 that are characteristic of the stocks in database 150 include, but are not limited to, all or some of: (1) 3-month price appreciation, (2) 6-month price appreciation, (3) 12-month price appreciation, (4) price-to-sales ratio and (5) 1-year sales growth. The value factors 186 that are characteristic of the stocks in database 150 in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present technology include, but are not limited to, all or some of: (1) price-to-book value ratio, (2) price-to-cash flow ratio and (3) return on assets.“Price appreciation” refers to the increase in price per share over the designated time period (e.g., 3, 6 or 12 months). In accordance with one embodiment, the higher a stock's price appreciation, the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology.“Price-to-sales ratio,” or P/S ratio, can be calculated, for example, by dividing the company's market capitalization (the number of shares multiplied by the share price) as of the close on the selection date by the company's total sales over the 12 months preceding the selection date. In accordance with one embodiment, the lower a stock's P/S ratio, the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology. Like other ratios described herein, it can be calculated, equivalently, on a per-share basis. The calculation may be performed by processor 120 using component values entered into database 150, and such calculated factors may be stored in database 150. Alternatively, the calculated factors may be entered directly to the database 150 if they are pre-calculated by hand or machine, or are available from a data provider. Such pre-calculated factors would be seen at 184, 186 in table 180.“1-year sales growth” is year over year change in the trailing 12 months of sales per share. In accordance with one embodiment, the higher a stock's 1-year sales growth, the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology.“Price-to-book value ratio,” or P/B ratio is a financial ratio used to compare a company's current market price to its book value. It can be calculated by, for example, dividing the company's market capitalization as of the close on the selection date by the company's total book value from its balance sheet as of the close on the selection date. In accordance with one embodiment, the lower a stock's P/B ratio, the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology.“Price-to-cash flow ratio,” or P/CF ratio, is a ratio used to compare a company's cash flow to its market value. It can be calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization as of the close on the selection date by the company's operating cash flow in the 12 months preceding the selection date. In accordance with one embodiment, the lower a stock's P/CF ratio, the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology.“Return on assets” (ROA) shows how efficient a company's assets are in generating profits. As used herein, ROA over the last four quarters, for example, can be measured by quarterly income, either before or after extraordinary items and less preferred dividends, divided by average assets value over the past four quarters. In accordance with one embodiment, the higher a stock's ROA percentage is, the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology.Referring again to FIG. 1, software application 160 is executed by processor 120 in order to carry out all or some of program flow 200, as shown in FIG. 2, in accordance with one embodiment of the present technology.Referring to FIG. 2, in step 210 of flow 200, information of an initial selection of securities is input into a database, such as database 150. The initial selection of securities may consist of either domestic or international stocks, as described above, and may be based at least in part on market capitalization. This step may be performed as described above in connection with FIG. 1, for example.In step 220 of flow 200, each stock is scored using one or more growth and one or more value factors. In some embodiments, each stock may then be assigned one or more growth factor ranks and one or more value factor ranks. For example, each of 200 stocks may be ranked from 1 to 200 for each of 3-month price appreciation, 6-month price appreciation, 12-month price appreciation, 1-year sales growth, price-to-sales ratio, price-to-book ratio, price-to-cash flow ratio and return on assets. In some embodiments, a raw growth score may then be determined for each stock by summing the ranks of the growth factor rankings, and a raw value score may be determined for each stock by summing the ranks of the value factor rankings. Stocks may then be ranked separately on both their raw growth and raw value scores. A routine 171 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform all or part of these steps. If a factor of a stock cannot be computed or used to rank a stock, that stock may be given the lowest possible ranking for that factor.In step 230 of flow 200, a selection score is determined for each stock. The selection score may be based on the growth or value factor scores or rankings, the raw growth or raw value scores or rankings, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the selection score of a stock is set equal to the better of the raw growth ranking and the raw value ranking. In some embodiments, the selection score of a stock is set equal to the better of a final growth score and a final value score, wherein the final growth scores and final value scores are based on the ranks according to raw growth and raw value score, and on a quantitative style overlay. The quantitative style overlay is applied to determine the weighting factor given to growth and value models within a stock portfolio, and may operate by multiplying the raw growth and raw value score rankings by the appropriate weighting factors to determine each stock's final growth and final value score, respectively. The selection score may then be set equal to the better of the final growth and final value scores, or to the better of a ranking based on the final growth score and a ranking based on the final value score. A routine 172 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform all or part of these steps. Calculated scores and/or rankings may be stored in database 150, for example.In step 240 of flow 200, stocks are ranked based at least in part on selection scores. In some embodiments, each stock in the initial selection of stocks is ranked, for example from 1 to 200 based on its selection score. Various tie-breaking schemes will readily suggest themselves, such as giving a better ranking to a stock with a selection score that was set equal to its final value score than a stock with the same selection score, but where the selection score was set equal to its final growth score. A routine 173 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step. Calculated rankings may be stored in database 150, for example.In step 250 of flow 200, a predetermined amount of the lowest ranking stocks (ranked by selection score) are eliminated. For example, the lowest ranked 25% of stocks or the lowest ranked 50 stocks may be eliminated from the initial selection of securities. A routine 174 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 260 of flow 200, the remaining stocks are divided into a plurality of sub-groups. For example, the remaining stocks may be divided into sub-groups based on their selection score rankings. As another example, the remaining stocks may be divided into sub-groups based on their raw growth and/or raw value scores and/or rankings. In some embodiments, the stocks are divided into quintiles. A routine 175 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 270 of flow 200, a stock portfolio is generated by weighting the remaining stocks according to sub-group. The sub-groups containing higher ranking or scoring stocks may receive more weight within the stock portfolio, and each stock within a sub-group is equally weighted. Where the sub-groups are quintiles, for example, the top ranked quintile may receive 5/15 (33.3%) of the stock portfolio weight, with successful quintiles receiving 4/15 (26.7%), 3/15 (20.0%), 2/15 (13.3%) and 1/15 (6.7%), respectively, with stocks being equally weighted within each quintile. A routine 176 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 280 of flow 200, an exchange-traded find is offered based on the stock portfolio generated in step 270. In some embodiments, the stocks in the stock portfolio can be rebalanced and reconstituted. At least a portion of the stocks may be rebalanced and reconstituted periodically, for example, on the last business day of each calendar quarter. According to certain embodiments, the stocks and their weights may be rebalanced and reconstituted on a quarterly selection date. The selected stocks and their weights in the stock portfolio can be rebalanced and reconstituted according to a proper daily index values calculation methodology. For example, the stock of an acquired company can be deleted from the stock portfolio at the close on the day the merger closes for both cash and stock deals. The acquired company's weight in the stock portfolio can be reallocated pro-rata among the remaining portfolio constituents, for example. For another example, in accordance with one embodiment, the stock of a spin-off is not included in the stock portfolio, and the value of the spin-off can be reallocated to its parent company.FIG. 3 shows a more specific embodiment of the present technology. Referring again to FIG. 1, software application 160 is executed by processor 120 in order to carry out a program flow 300, as shown in FIG. 3.Referring to FIG. 3, in step 310 of flow 300, information of the largest (by market capitalization) 200 domestic or international stocks is input into a database, such as database 150. As noted above for this specification, “domestic stocks” are stocks of companies listed on a U.S. exchange that are domiciled in the U.S., U.S. territories or possessions, or in certain tax havens such as Cayman Islands and Bermuda, and “international stocks” are those stocks that are not domestic stocks. The input information corresponds to the information as of the close of trading on a selection date, such as the last business day of a calendar quarter. This step may be performed as described above in connection with FIG. 1, for example.In step 315 of flow 300, each of the 200 stocks from step 310 is scored and ranked according to growth factors and value factors. In this embodiment, growth factors are 3, 6 and 12-month price appreciation, 1-year sales growth and price-to-sales ratio, and value factors are price-to-book ratio, price-to-cash flow ratio and return on assets. Thus, each stock has five growth factor scores, five growth factor ranks, three value factor scores, and three value factor ranks. A routine 171 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 320 of flow 300, the five growth factor ranks are summed for each stock to determine a raw growth score for that stock. For example, if a stock is ranked 21 for 3-month price appreciation, 25 for 6-month price appreciation, 17 for 12-month price appreciation, 89 for 1-year sales growth, and 117 for price-to-sales ratio, its raw growth score would be 269 (=21+25+17+89+117). A routine 172 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 325 of flow 300, the three value factor ranks are summed for each stock to determine a raw value score for that stock. For example, if a stock is ranked 124 for price-to-book ratio, 135 for, price-to-cash flow ratio, and 72 for return on assets, its raw value score would be 331 (=124+135+72). A routine 173 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 330 of flow 300, each stock is ranked from 1 to 200 according to raw growth score and from 1 to 200 according to raw value score. A routine 174 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 335 of flow 300, the selection score of each stock is set equal to the better of its raw growth score rank and its raw value score rank. Alternatively, in some embodiments, a quantitative style overlay may be applied at the beginning of, or prior to, this step. The quantitative style overlay determines the weighting factor given to growth and value models within a stock portfolio, and may operate by multiplying the raw growth and raw value score rankings by the appropriate weighting factors to determine each stock's final growth and final value score, respectively. The selection score may then instead be set equal to the better of the final growth and final value scores, or to the better of a ranking based on the final growth score and a ranking based on the final value score. A routine 175 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform any of these steps.In step 340 of flow 300, stocks are ranked from 1 to 200 according to their selection scores. A routine 176 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 345 of flow 300, the bottom 25% of stocks are eliminated based on selection score rankings (i.e. the lowest/worst ranked 50 stocks are eliminated from the initial 200). A routine 177 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 350 of flow 300, the remaining (top 75%, or 150) stocks are divided into quintiles based on raw growth and raw value ranks. For example, the top quintile of the remaining 150 stocks (i.e. the top 30 remaining stocks) may be grouped together as a result of those stocks having the highest raw growth rank, the highest raw value rank, or the highest selection score (which is based on raw growth and/or value rank or score). A routine 178 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 355 of flow 300, a stock portfolio is generated by weighting the remaining 150 stocks according to quintile. For example, the top ranked quintile may receive 5/15 (33.3%) of the stock portfolio weight, with successful quintiles receiving 4/15 (26.7%), 3/15 (20.0%), 2/15 (13.3%) and 1/15 (6.7%), respectively. Stocks are equally weighted within each quintile. Thus, for example, the 30 top-ranked stocks would, overall, have a 33.3% weight of the stock portfolio, the next 30 stocks would have an overall 26.7% weight of the stock portfolio, etc. A routine 179 (FIG. 1) may be called and executed by processor 120 (FIG. 1) so as to perform this step.In step 360 of flow 300, an exchange-traded fund is offered based on the stock portfolio. In some embodiments, the stocks in the stock portfolio can be rebalanced and reconstituted, as described above in connection with FIG. 2, for example.While the present technology has been described with reference to certain embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents substituted without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt to a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from its scope. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed.

Early life[edit]
Hogg was the son of Sir James Weir Hogg, Bt., the Administrator-General of Bengal and Chairman of the British East India Company, and was born in Calcutta. His surname at birth was merely Hogg, but he added the surname McGarel on 8 February 1877 on inheriting the estates of Charles McGarel, his brother-in-law.
Career[edit]
He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford but left Oxford early without taking his degree to enter the Army and became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Life Guards, part of the Household Cavalry. On retiring from the Army he went into politics, being elected unopposed as a Conservative MP for Bath in 1865.
He was also a member of St. George, Hanover Square Vestry, a form of local government similar to a parish council. From 1867 he was chosen by the Vestry to represent them on the Metropolitan Board of Works which co-ordinated cross-London building schemes. He was defeated for re-election in Bath in 1868 and concentrated on his work on the Board, and after the death of Sir John Thwaites who had chaired the Board since it was created, he was elected as the new Chairman on 18 November 1870. Hogg was elected MP for Truro in an 1871 byelection and retained that seat until he transferred to Hornsey at the 1885 general election.
His Parliamentary duties made it more difficult for Hogg to be a full-time chairman of the Board. While his predecessor had dismissed staff who he felt were not up to the job, Hogg used his influence to try to keep their jobs safe. Unlike Thwaites, he did not look in detail at the work of the staff but let them get on with their work. This meant that departments within the Board became either very efficient, or very inefficient. The Architects department was particularly noted for inefficiency.
Several of the Board's big schemes were just being completed when McGarel-Hogg's Chairmanship began. The Victoria Embankment had been opened shortly before he was elected, and he got to share in the rewards for the Board's successes, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1874 when the Chelsea Embankment was opened. Under McGarel-Hogg, the Board bought up all of the bridges over the Thames and freed them of tolls. However, the Board's desire for a new bridge by Little Tower Hill could not be fulfilled because its revenue source was not secure. Tower Bridge was eventually built by the City of London Corporation.
The Board also acquired the power to clear slums in 1875, but found the process cumbersome and expensive, resulting in small progress (although it accelerated when further Acts of Parliament removed some restrictions). Several parks were also bought by the Board and opened to the public. However, McGarel-Hogg's administration was hit by scandal in 1887 over the sale of surplus land, blighting somewhat the award of a peerage in the celebrations of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. A Royal Commission found officers and two members of the Board guilty of malpractice. This resulted in the decision to abolish the Board and replace it with a directly-elected council.
Magheramorne had fought for the Board to get permission to build a tunnel at Blackwall and it had been granted in 1887. The tenders for the contract came in early in 1889, when the London County Council had been elected but was not yet in control. He was determined to grant the contract through the Board and resisted the LCC's request that it leave the decision to them; however, when the LCC discovered the Board's intention to seal the contracts, they appealed to the Government and the Board was abolished on 21 March 1889.




Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London


Later life[edit]
He died in 1890, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Magheramorne married Caroline Elizabeth Emma Douglas-Pennant, the daughter of Edward Gordon Douglas-Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn. He died a year after leaving office at the MBW, with his son James inheriting the peerage.

Early life[edit]
Hogg was the son of Sir James Weir Hogg, Bt., the Administrator-General of Bengal and Chairman of the British East India Company, and was born in Calcutta. His surname at birth was merely Hogg, but he added the surname McGarel on 8 February 1877 on inheriting the estates of Charles McGarel, his brother-in-law.
Career[edit]
He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford but left Oxford early without taking his degree to enter the Army and became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Life Guards, part of the Household Cavalry. On retiring from the Army he went into politics, being elected unopposed as a Conservative MP for Bath in 1865.
He was also a member of St. George, Hanover Square Vestry, a form of local government similar to a parish council. From 1867 he was chosen by the Vestry to represent them on the Metropolitan Board of Works which co-ordinated cross-London building schemes. He was defeated for re-election in Bath in 1868 and concentrated on his work on the Board, and after the death of Sir John Thwaites who had chaired the Board since it was created, he was elected as the new Chairman on 18 November 1870. Hogg was elected MP for Truro in an 1871 byelection and retained that seat until he transferred to Hornsey at the 1885 general election.
His Parliamentary duties made it more difficult for Hogg to be a full-time chairman of the Board. While his predecessor had dismissed staff who he felt were not up to the job, Hogg used his influence to try to keep their jobs safe. Unlike Thwaites, he did not look in detail at the work of the staff but let them get on with their work. This meant that departments within the Board became either very efficient, or very inefficient. The Architects department was particularly noted for inefficiency.
Several of the Board's big schemes were just being completed when McGarel-Hogg's Chairmanship began. The Victoria Embankment had been opened shortly before he was elected, and he got to share in the rewards for the Board's successes, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1874 when the Chelsea Embankment was opened. Under McGarel-Hogg, the Board bought up all of the bridges over the Thames and freed them of tolls. However, the Board's desire for a new bridge by Little Tower Hill could not be fulfilled because its revenue source was not secure. Tower Bridge was eventually built by the City of London Corporation.
The Board also acquired the power to clear slums in 1875, but found the process cumbersome and expensive, resulting in small progress (although it accelerated when further Acts of Parliament removed some restrictions). Several parks were also bought by the Board and opened to the public. However, McGarel-Hogg's administration was hit by scandal in 1887 over the sale of surplus land, blighting somewhat the award of a peerage in the celebrations of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. A Royal Commission found officers and two members of the Board guilty of malpractice. This resulted in the decision to abolish the Board and replace it with a directly-elected council.
Magheramorne had fought for the Board to get permission to build a tunnel at Blackwall and it had been granted in 1887. The tenders for the contract came in early in 1889, when the London County Council had been elected but was not yet in control. He was determined to grant the contract through the Board and resisted the LCC's request that it leave the decision to them; however, when the LCC discovered the Board's intention to seal the contracts, they appealed to the Government and the Board was abolished on 21 March 1889.

Later life[edit]
He died in 1890, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Magheramorne married Caroline Elizabeth Emma Douglas-Pennant, the daughter of Edward Gordon Douglas-Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn. He died a year after leaving office at the MBW, with his son James inheriting the peerage.
