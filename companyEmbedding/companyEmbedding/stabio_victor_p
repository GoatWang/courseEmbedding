               Hallador is a Spanish word that means finder or discoverer or one who leads the way. Hallador Energy Company was founded as a Colorado corporation in July 1951 under the name of Kimbark Oil and Gas Company. In December 1989, Kimbark merged with Hallador Exploration Company, a California company founded in 1985, to become Hallador Energy Company. Hallador entered into a joint venture with Sunrise Coal, LLC in April 2006. With this venture, Hallador's primary focus changed from oil and gas production to coal production. Today, Sunrise Coal is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hallador. Additionally, Hallador has a 45 percent equity interest in Savoy Energy, L.P., an oil and gas company with operations in Michigan.
