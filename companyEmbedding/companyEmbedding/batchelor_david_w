����������������������� APPEAL
from an order of the circuit court for Walworth County:� MICHAEL
S. GIBBS, Judge.� Reversed.� 
����������������������� Before
Snyder, P.J., Nettesheim and Anderson, JJ.�

����������������������� SNYDER,
P.J.�� ����������������������� David
W. Batchelor appeals from an order disqualifying his counsel in divorce and
domestic abuse proceedings.� He contends
that the motion of his wife, Therese A. Batchelor, to disqualify his counsel
due to a conflict of interest was untimely and subject to waiver.� In addition, David argues that Therese
failed to meet her burden of proof requiring disqualification and that the
trial court failed to make the necessary findings of fact to support the
disqualification order.� Because we
conclude that Therese waived her right to object to David�s counsel due to
untimeliness, we reverse.� We also agree
that the necessary basis for a conflict of interest disqualification was not
established in this case.
����������������������� The
relevant facts are extensive but undisputed.�
David served Therese with a divorce summons and petition on May 21,
1996.� Each document identified David�s
divorce counsel as Attorney John O. Olson,�
Braden & Olson, 716 Wisconsin Street, P.O. Box 940, Lake Geneva, WI
53147 and provided the law firm�s phone number.� On June 3, 1996, David appeared at the initial temporary hearing
with Braden & Olson Attorney Christine Tomas and Therese appeared with Attorney
Henry Sibbing.� On June 24, 1996,� Therese filed an order to show cause why
Braden & Olson should not be held in contempt because �[i]t has been 17
days since temporary hearing on June 3, 1996 and Petitioner�s attorneys
Braden & Olson have failed to submit a temporary order for signature on
a timely basis.�� (Emphasis added.) �Sibbing withdrew as Therese�s counsel on
June 25, 1996.
����������������������� Therese
received a letter, dated June 27, 1996, from Tomas on Braden & Olson
letterhead and later attached a copy of the letter to her July 10, 1996 motion
for contempt. �On July 10, she
also filed a reply to David�s motion for contempt �by Braden & Olson
Attorneys for David W. Batchelor.�� On
July 15, 1996, a hearing occurred on the parties� cross-motions for contempt.� David appeared with Tomas and Therese
appeared with Attorney Mark A. Brellenthin of Dade &� Brellenthin.
����������������������� On
August 16, 1996, Therese filed a � 813.12,
Stats., domestic violence
petition against David, which was heard before a family court commissioner on
August 22, 1996.[1]� At the injunction hearing, Therese appeared
pro se[2]
and orally objected, for the first time, to Tomas appearing as David�s
counsel.� Therese alleged that she had
contacted the Braden & Olson firm on February 20, 1996, and had engaged in
a fifteen-minute conversation with Attorney Kurt Van Buskirk.� She also claimed that during that
conversation she had revealed confidential information to Van Buskirk about her
relationship with David.� However,
Van Buskirk was no longer with the Braden & Olson firm.� David responded to Therese�s objection
as being untimely and also upon substantive grounds.� The court commissioner scheduled an evidentiary hearing on� the matter for September 16, 1996, and
informed Therese that it would be her responsibility to subpoena Van Buskirk
for the hearing.
����������������������� At
the September 16 hearing, the court commissioner took testimony from Therese
regarding her conversation with Van Buskirk.[3]� Van Buskirk was not subpoenaed by
Therese.� Based upon Therese�s testimony,
the court commissioner made a factual finding that a phone conversation took
place between Therese and Van Buskirk.�
However, the commissioner continued the hearing in order to allow
David to call Van Buskirk as a witness[4]
because she was unsure �whether or not the information in the phone call
disadvantages [Therese] in this litigation� or if the phone call established an
attorney-client relationship.� The
matter was rescheduled for October 15, 1996, to allow for the appearance of Van
Buskirk, and briefs were ordered on the question of whether an attorney-client
relationship was established and requesting the parties to supply any existing
precedents concerning imputed disqualification.� 
����������������������� The
next hearing took place on October 17, 1996, before a circuit court judge[5]
who relied on the court commissioner�s factual finding that a phone
conversation occurred between Therese and Van Buskirk and stated that �[t]here
really aren�t any factual issues� because �there�s already been a factual basis
established.�� The trial court then
ruled that �confidences were shared by Therese Batchelor with Kurt Van Buskirk�
and that Braden & Olson should be disqualified from representing David in
both the � 813.12,
Stats., injunction and ch. 767,
Stats., divorce matters.[6]� This court granted David�s petition for
leave to appeal the disqualification of counsel by order dated December 4,
1996.
����������������������� We
first address whether Therese waived her right to raise an attorney
disqualification claim.� Waiver is a voluntary and intentional
relinquishment of a known right.� See
Consumer�s
Coop. v. Olsen, 142
Wis.2d 465,
492, 419
N.W.2d 211,
221 (1988).� Evidence sufficient to establish waiver must
show that ��the person against whom the waiver is asserted had at the time
knowledge, actual or constructive, of the existence of his [or her] rights or
facts upon which they depended.�� Id. (quoted source
omitted).� Intent to waive may be
inferred as a matter of law by the conduct of the parties.� See id. 
����������������������� Waiver
of� an attorney disqualification claim
has not been addressed in Wisconsin case law.�
However, in other jurisdictions it has been widely held that in attorney
disqualification matters the failure to raise a timely objection may result in
waiver.� See Cox
v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 847
F.2d 725, 729 (11th Cir. 1988).[7]� The rationale behind this rule was explained
succinctly in� Central
Milk Producers Coop. v. Sentry Food Stores, Inc., 573
F.2d 988, 992 (8th
Cir. 1978),
when the court held that �[t]his court will not allow a litigant to delay
filing a motion to disqualify in order to use the motion as a later tool to
deprive his opponent of counsel of his choice after substantial preparation of
a case has been completed.�
����������������������� Additionally,
the related but distinct equitable doctrine of laches has been held to apply to
an attorney disqualification claim because it is �an equitable, not a legal,
matter.�� Jackson
v. J.C. Penny Co., 521
F. Supp. 1032, 1034 (N.D.
Ga. 1981).� In applying the doctrine of laches, our
supreme court has held that for laches to arise there must be unreasonable
delay, knowledge of the course of events and acquiescence therein, and
prejudice to the party asserting the defense.�
See Paterson
v. Paterson, 73
Wis.2d 150,
153, 242
N.W.2d 907,
909 (1976).� We apply each of the three Paterson elements,
the second of which is consistent with the requirements of waiver, to this
case.
����������������������� The
first Paterson prong relates to whether the delay was
unreasonable.� To determine whether
Therese�s delay was unreasonable, we look to the facts.� When the principal facts and reasonable
inferences drawn therefrom are undisputed, as herein, we are not bound by the
trial court�s findings of fact.� See State
v. Williams, 104
Wis.2d 15,
21-22, 310
N.W.2d 601,
604-05 (1981).�� It is well settled in Wisconsin that:
��� �A court of
equity applies the rules of laches according to its ideas of right and justice,
and the courts have never prescribed any specific period applicable to every
case, like the statute of limitations; and what constitutes a reasonable time
within which the suit must be brought depends upon the facts and circumstances
of each particular case.�
Diehl
v. Dunn, 13
Wis.2d 280,
286, 108
N.W.2d 519,
522 (1961)
(quoted source omitted).
����������������������� Therese
appeared twice at divorce hearings where a Braden & Olson attorney
represented David and did not raise the disqualification issue.[8]� She was continuously aware that the Braden
& Olson firm was representing David from the time that she was served with
the divorce pleadings (May 21, 1996) containing the law firm�s name and address
until the time she raised her objection (August 16, 1996).� During that period, Therese brought a
contempt motion against Braden & Olson and responded directly to Braden
& Olson in its capacity as counsel for David in a contempt motion brought
against her.� Her objection was made
several months after the commencement of the divorce action.� We are satisfied that the delay was
unreasonable.� 
����������������������� We
now turn to the second prong of the Paterson laches test�knowledge
of the course of events and acquiescence therein.� A �slight delay, accompanied by circumstances of negligence,
apparent acquiescence, or change of�
defendant�s position, has been held sufficient� to sustain a defense of
laches.� Likens
v. Likens, 136
Wis. 321,
327, 117
N.W. 799,
801 (1908).� We are satisfied that Therese had notice and
knowledge that Braden & Olson was representing David on May 21, 1996, and
that her failure to raise the issue at the outset of the proceedings leads to
the inference that she had acquiesced to the firm�s representation of
David.� Her timely knowledge of� the firm�s representation and her conduct in
failing to take prompt action also support waiver as a matter of law. 
����������������������� The
third prong of the Paterson test is that of prejudice to the
other party.� We are satisfied upon this
record that substantial preparation was done on David�s behalf by Braden &
Olson prior to Therese�s belated disqualification motion.� There were multiple court appearances,
motions filed, motions responded to, witnesses subpoenaed, documents drafted
(including the divorce pleadings) and consultations with Therese and her
counsel.� Therese admitted to contacting
five or six area law firms before she chose her attorney.� Disqualification of the Braden &
Olson firm could also adversely limit David�s ability to retain local counsel;
in fact, record documents suggest that he has already been compelled to retain
counsel outside of the local area.� We
conclude that Therese�s failure to file a timely objection to Braden &
Olson�s representation of David is prejudicial to him in terms of time and
money.
����������������������� In
sum, we conclude that Therese waived her right to raise the conflict of
interest issue because:� (1) she had
knowledge of David�s divorce counsel in May, (2) her objection in August was
untimely, (3) the delay in objecting was unreasonable, (4) her failure to
object earlier resulted in an inferred acquiescence to Braden & Olson�s
involvement, and (5) David would be prejudiced by the disqualification of the
Braden & Olson firm.� Because
Therese�s waiver of her right is supported�
by both the application of the legal requirements for a finding of
waiver and under� the doctrine of
laches, we reverse and remand for reinstatement of Braden & Olson as
David�s counsel.
����������������������� Normally
we would conclude this opinion based upon our above holding which disposes of
the appellate issue.� However, because
the trial court considered the disqualification on substantive grounds, we will
also address the issue of whether the Rules of Professional Conduct require
that Braden & Olson be disqualified.�
Motions to disqualify are reviewed under the misuse of discretion
standard.� See State
v. Miller, 160
Wis.2d 646,
654, 467
N.W.2d 118,
120 (1991).� In Jesse
v. Danforth, 169
Wis.2d 229,
485
N.W.2d 63
(1992),
our supreme court adopted the standard of review set forth in Berg
v. Marine Trust Co., 141
Wis.2d 878,
887, 416
N.W.2d 643,
647 (Ct.
App. 1987):
��� The trial court
�possesses broad discretion in determining whether [attorney] disqualification
is required in a particular case, and the scope of our review is limited
accordingly.�� Generally, we will not find
an abuse of discretion if the record shows that discretion was in fact
exercised and we can perceive a reasonable basis for the trial court�s
decision.� However, �we have never
hesitated to reverse discretionary determinations where the exercise of discretion
is based on an error of law.� 
Jesse,
169
Wis.2d� at 245-46,
�485
N.W.2d at 69.
����������������������� The
legal basis underlying Therese�s motion is ch. SCR 20, �Rules of Professional
Conduct for Attorneys.�� In Wisconsin an
attorney must be disqualified when it is established that (1) an
attorney-client relationship existed between a party and the attorney, and (2)
that attorney is now representing an adverse party in a substantially related
matter.� See Burkes
v. Hales, 165
Wis.2d 585,
591, 478
N.W.2d 37,
40 (Ct.
App. 1991).� The determination of both parts of the test
are mixed questions of law and fact for the trial court.� See id.�at 592, 478 N.W.2d at 40.
����������������������� However,
because this issue involves the former law firm of Van Buskirk and not Van
Buskirk himself, we turn to the rule of imputed disqualification, which reads:
Imputed disqualification: general rule.� (a) While lawyers are associated in a
firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them
practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so ....
 
....
 
(c) When a lawyer has terminated an association
with a firm, the firm is not prohibited from thereafter representing a person
with interests materially adverse to those of a client represented by the
formerly associated lawyer unless:
 
��� (1) the matter
is the same or substantially related to that in which the formerly associated
lawyer represented the client; and
 
��� (2) any
lawyer remaining in the firm has information protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(b)
that is material to the matter.
SCR 20:1.10 (West 1997) (emphasis added).
����������������������� Therese�s
theory is that because Van Buskirk had information she volunteered about her
marriage and that he gave her advice, his former firm, Braden & Olson,
should now be precluded from representing David.[9]
����������������������� For
purposes of this analysis, we will not disturb the factual findings of the
court commissioner that a conversation took place or the trial court�s
additional finding that the conversation established an attorney-client
relationship.[10]� It is undisputed that the subject phone call
to Van Buskirk and David�s representation by Braden & Olson are the same or
substantially related.
����������������������� However,
that does not fully resolve the conflict of interest question. The second prong
of� SCR 20:1.10(c) requires a further
determination of whether �any attorney remaining in the firm has information
protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(b) that is material to the matter.�� This record is devoid of any evidence in
that regard.� Therese has provided only
limited testimony regarding the content of her conversation with Van Buskirk
and there is no record evidence which suggests, even inferentially, that Van
Buskirk�s knowledge could be imputed to any other Braden & Olson
attorney.� Because the only evidence
relied upon is the testimony of Therese, and she was unable to provide any
evidence which suggested that the information she gave to Van Buskirk was
passed to another attorney, we conclude that the applicable standard was not
met.
����������������������� The� trial court erred in finding that a complete
factual record had been established at the earlier hearings before the family
court commissioner.� Had we not
determined that the disqualification claim was waived by Therese�s conduct and
lack of timely objection, we would be obliged to remand the matter to the trial
court for� further� factual inquiry as to whether the second
prong of the applicable rule is satisfied.�
Therese�s phone call testimony, without further evidence as to its
disclosure to other members of the law firm, is not enough to satisfy the
second prong of SCR 20:1.10(c).
����������������������� Because
Therese waived her right to object to David�s counsel, the order disqualifying
Braden & Olson from representing David in the divorce action and the
injunction proceedings must be�
reversed.
����������������������� By
the Court.�Order reversed. 




 
 




[1] The
injunction procedure is referenced several times by both parties but the � 813.12,
Stats., petition is not part of
the record.� Therese concedes that the
most recent incident of abuse alleged in the petition was on May 13, 1996.


[2]�� It is unclear why Therese appeared without
counsel from Dade & Brellenthin at this hearing.


[3]�� Therese offered a copy of her phone �log�
purportedly faxed from the phone company which she claimed indicated that on
February 20, 1996, there was a seventeen-minute phone conversation. There is
nothing in the record that indicates whether the log showed what number Therese
was connected to for the seventeen-minute call.� The copy was illegible and was not accepted into the record as
evidence.� 


[4]�� The court commissioner stated, �I am not
... making a ruling without Mr. Van Buskirk.�
And at this point his testimony is essential.�


[5] There is no
indication in the parties� briefs or in the record as to how or why the matter
was transferred from the court commissioner to the circuit court.


[6] After ruling
on the disqualification as it related to the injunction, the circuit court then
extended the disqualification to the divorce matter as well, reasoning that
�it�s best for all concerned ... to err on the side of caution and order the
disqualification of both files.�


[7]�� See also Trust
Corp. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 701
F.2d 85, 87-88 (9th
Cir. 1983);
Central Milk Producers Coop. v. Sentry Food Stores, Inc., 573
F.2d 988, 992 (8th
Cir. 1978);
In
re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litig., 530
F.2d 83, 90 (5th
Cir. 1976);� Redd
v. Shell Oil Co., 518
F.2d 311, 315 (10th
Cir. 1975);
Glover
v. Libman, 578
F. Supp. 748, 760 (N.D.
Ga. 1983).


[8]�� David argues that Therese was also aware of
Braden & Olson�s representation of David because the firm was representing
him in a criminal matter prior to her objection. Therese contends that her
counsel sent a letter to Tomas several weeks prior to August 16, 1996,
requesting that Braden & Olson disqualify itself.� Because these contentions are not supported by the record before
us, they will not be considered.� 


[9]�� Therese did not testify as to what advice
Van Buskirk gave her.


[10]�� While the parties do not raise or argue the
merits of a family court commissioner�s involvement in attorney
disqualification matters, we note that �� 757.69
and 767.13(2), Stats.,
concerning family court commissioners� powers and duties, do not authorize
their involvement in attorney disqualifications.� We also note that where a � 813.12,
Stats., matter is raised during
the pendancy of a divorce action before a court commissioner, he or she is to
submit the matter to the trial court within five days.� See � 767.23(1m), Stats.�
Had the court commissioner referred the injunction proceeding to the
trial court and had the trial court been involved in the disqualification
motion from the beginning, this appeal might been avoided.

David Batchelor
David Batchelor’s art is about colour. With lightboxes and everyday plastics, eccentric chandeliers and projections, he brings pure, direct colour into galleries and public spaces. His works are immediately delightful, but they are also concerned with what colour means in today’s world and with how we experience it.
David Batchelor’s art is also about the city. His colours are the bright, sharp hues of neon and artificial materials, not the soft tones of the natural world.
In this profile, the artist is interviewed in his studio, the place where he explores and experiments with “the stuff of the world”. He speaks about many key works and reflects on his distinctive public commissions, including a tower of colour for the Whitehall offices of the Treasury and an illuminated tree by the Thames. Like the best art, these are intellectual works, thoughtful and rigorous, but they are fun too, pleasurable and beautiful.
theEYE is an excellent introduction to contemporary artists and their works and provides an ideal resource for a wide range of audiences, including galleries, museums and colleges, as well as individual art-lover.
