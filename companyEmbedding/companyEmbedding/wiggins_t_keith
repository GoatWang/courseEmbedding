 Educational Background



 


Auburn University

                  Auburn University (AU or Auburn) is a public university located in Auburn, Alabama, United States. With more than 25,000 students and 1,200 faculty members, it is one of the largest universities in the state. Auburn was chartered on February 7, 1856, as the East Alabama Male College, a private liberal arts school affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In 1872, the college became the state's first public land-grant university under the Morrill Act and was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama. In 1892, the college became the first four-year coeducational school in the state. The curriculum at the university originally focused on arts and agriculture. This trend changed under the guidance of Dr. William Leroy Broun, who taught classics and sciences and believed both disciplines were important in the overall growth of the university and the individual. The college was renamed the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) in 1899, largely because of Dr. Broun’s influence. The college continued expanding, and in 1960 its name was officially changed to Auburn University to acknowledge the varied academic programs and larger curriculum of a major university. In 1964, under Federal Court mandate AU admitted its first African American Student. It had been popularly known as "Auburn" for many years. Auburn is among the few American universities designated as a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant research center.

KEITH COWBOY - THE REAL MC COY











 
 
 





                    
        REMEMBERING KEITH COWBOY
                                        
                           
        By JayQuan 
 
                               
             
        
 


When
        we hear people talk about Hip Hop greats that have passed , we often
        hear of Tupac , Biggie , Jam Master Jay and maybe even Scott La Rock.
        But very seldom is the name Keith Cowboy Wiggins mentioned. Keith
        Cowboy laid the foundation for the call & response tactics that we
        have seen almost EVERY Emcee use since the 70s. Everytime you hear
        throw your hands in the air , Say hoooo etc. etc. you are
        listening to the creations of Cowboy. 
        Unfortunately Cowboy did not get the chance to see his
        contributions reach every corner of the globe. Its only right that
        Cowboys story be told by those closest to him  his family members
        & fellow Furious 5 brothers.

        with the crowd response. Even with working out , he would get down on
        the floor & do his push ups , then Scorp started working out with
        him. I didnt want to be the weakest link , so it was me Cowboy &
        Scorp working out. Cowboy had big arms , he didnt have big shoulders
        or anything , but he definitely had some big guns. So we got into the
        whole fintness thing through working out with Cowboy.
 


JayQuan : Im
        told basically that Cowboy was the first Emcee.
 


Mel : Yeah ,
        it wasnt even called Emceeing back then , but he was the first to get
        on Flashes mic and do the crowd response  without a doubt.
 


JQ : How did
        the 3 Emcees (Cowboy , Mele Mel & Kid Creole) form. I know Cowboy
        was first , how did you & Cre join?
 


 Mel
        : We used to dance for Flash. We were called the D Squad . Before we
        started rocking the mic Flash would just put the mic down & Cowboy
        was the main one on the mic. Me & Creole would be in the house
        writing routines , and we just started to grab the mic. Our routine was
        a lot more polished than the average person. When we first started doing
        our indoor parties in the Fall of 77 we would put on our flyers
        Flash & The 3 Emcees. The whole hit was from Summer to Winter.
        You did the parties in the Summer to get the rep to do the Fall &
        Winter. You couldnt do indoor parties in the Summer unless you were
        Kool Herc , cus no one would come inside.
 


JQ: I have
        been told that the whole intro that Wonder Mike does on Rappers
        Delight is actually part of Cowboys routine.
 


Mel: 
        Without a doubt. This kid named 
        Kokomo was going to the army & Cowboy was messin with him
        -teasing him with the marching Hip Hop rythm Hip/Hop/Hip/Hop ; and he
        just took it on from there and kept goin with it. It just took on a
        life of its own..
 


 


 


SCORPIO


 


He was the
        strength of the Furious 5 , and he really kept us together ; not just on
        the mic but his strength kept us in check with each other. If anyone
        went far left , he was the one to make sure that we got back. We
        didnt only respect him for who he was , but he was stronger than all
        of us , and he would knock you out !!!! Dont get me wrong , its
        not like we had a violent relationship in the Furious , but if you got
        him to a certain level its like if he said its goin down
        like this  you had to respect it. He never got irrate like that
        unless something was happening that affected the five of us , and he
        would step in. He also kept just the average street people off of us
        too. Its not like we were a bunch of punks , but he was just the one.
        The rest of us were way more diplomatic , where if somethin happened
        we would try to talk it out before it got to that. If someone said
        somethin negative about the Furious he would just knockem out. It
        sounds negative , but comin up the way that we did , you needed
        people like that around you. Thats just the street level , as far as
        his character besides being the first Emcee. People perceive Mel as
        being the top guy in our group , and he was the top lyricist , but
        nobody could rock the crowd like Cowboy. He could rock any crowd with no
        script  , nothing written
        down. He would step on stage & ask did yall see the Knicks
        game tonight?  just stuff that nobody else was sayin on stage ,
        in addition to the say ho.  He
        had the ability to really personalize the whole crowd like he knew
        everybody in there. That was his gift & his trademark. Even back
        then he said stuff  like all the single moms and all the sexy ladies say 
        owwww it was different hearing it back then because no one had
        said it before. It even took Mel some time to gain his power , like a
        couple of records , but when we first went out on the road with
        Superrappin , Freedom , Birthday Party & It's Nasty it was ALL about
        Cowboy!!! After the concert we would all be tryin' to get girls and we
        would have no girls. Cowboy would have 3 or 4 in his room !!! It
        wasnt like they would settle for just anyone in the group , they
        specifically wanted Cowboy. I didnt get the rep as a ladies man until
        the stage shows really developed  &
        the era of Rick James & Super Freak ; thats how I came into my
        own. But before me it
        was all about him , till the point that it almost wasnt fair. We came
        out & posed and sweated and all he had to do was walk out with his
        bow legs. We had to settle for straight cookie monsters in the early
        days , cus all the Fly ones wanted Cowboy. He was the personable one
        in the group ;  and I know for a fact that if he was still alive we would
        still be together. The stuff that Flash is doin now , only performing
        by himself  no way that would happen if Cowboy was still alive!!
        Cowboy would physically walk up to him & break everything down to
        him & give him an option ; just that simple. Either you get yo
        ass back together with this group that we all built , or im gon knock
        you out !!! Thats who he was and we all understood it , respected
        and knew that if he said it he meant it. One time we was on the road
        overseas and he missed the plane. I just so happened to call his house
        because I have a child with his sister. I heard him yellin in the
        background watch when they come back , thats aight watch!! We
        left him , cus Mel was tryin to teach him a lesson about being late. We
        had about 6 shows left , and I was countin the days and literally
        walkin on air!! I knew it was comin. Mel aint even know , and I
        was so shook that I aint even tell him. But I knew that he loved
        money , so when we got off the plane I was like yo I got a couple of
        dollars for you. He aint even say nothin. That might sound weird
        but it really wasnt one of those torturous relationships , or on the
        level of him bullying us  ,
        in fact it was really that he had so much love for us that he was
        protectin us.
 


But with the
        Des Moines Iowa show I knew that as soon as I heard the crowd yellin
        and cussin , that Cowboy was gonna react. And he did. He started rumblin
        with all of em  throwing chairs and everything. He even got
        stabbed.
 


 


I remember he
        had just gotten out of jail , and the Latin Quarters had just opened and
        it was mad Brooklyn nig#as  ,
        stick up kids and all that. We knew em all , but they would flip at
        any given time. We brought Cowboy down there to party on his first night
        out. He got on the  mic and
        tore the crowd to pieces. We went down stairs and people were fightin. I
        had been there so much that I knew all the back rooms and stuff , so I
        tried to tell Cowboy lets go over here. He was like I aint movin,
         I aint goin nowhere. He was standin there almost like he
        was daring one of those Brooklyn cats to run up on him. This is who he
        was. He stood there with so much pride like a warrior. Its not like he
        was a knuckle head or anything like that , he just felt like the
        fighting had nothin to do with him , so he wasnt movin.
 


How
        did the dynamics of the group change for the period that it was just you
        , Mel & Cowboy ?
 


Well at first
        it was just me & Mel , then I saw that some money might be comin in
        , so I said to Cowboy lets do what we have to for now, but for a point I
        wasnt even down. I had a deal with Def Jam , but Sugarhill Records
        interfered with it. Me & L.L. were the first ones to get contracts
        from Def Jam. I only went back to Sugarhill because they were blockin
        everything that I was tryin to do. At first even Mel left. For a
        brief time the whole group walked. I guess Sylvia got in Mels ear , and
        he was the first to go back. Flash took me to Elektra to talk to them
        when he was puttin his new group together , but somethin didnt
        feel right so I didnt mess with either one for a minute.
 


 


Did
        Cowboy ever try to get the group back together initially?


 


No because we
        stayed busy soon after we decided that it would be me , him & Mel ,
        so it never got time to really sink in. We were touring big when Step
        Off came out. I do remember that he didnt like the direction that
        we were goin in musically. He felt the records were almost like rock
        & roll , and I wish we had listened cus he said we need to
        make records with just beats. And right after Run  Dmc came out
        with just beats. Cowboy really knew what the streets wanted to hear ,
        and neither me or Mel listened.
 


 


At
        the time of the On The Strength lp i t seems Cowboy was deep in
        that life  do you think that there is anything that any of you could
        have done to prevent what happened?


 


 


No not really.
        He was stayin with his stepdad in Queensbridge and we thought that he
        was being looked after. Me & Mel just basically up & left and
        went to Cali. We didnt really have our ear to the streets. When I
        heard that he died I was shocked , I didnt know he was sick or nothin.
        And to be honest at that point we became so consumed with our own stuff
        that we became almost selfish and was just tryin to make it. The group
        was all over the place , and everybody was tryin to do somethin
        but it was all amounting to nothin..
 


 


RAHIEM
 


 


I can concur
        with what everyone else says as far as him being the enforcer of the
        group when anyone tried to take advantage of 
        us, especially by force. He would always be one to say its not
        goin down like that. In fact I nicknamed him 10 and 0 because
        whenever he had a fight with someone he knocked em out with one
        punch.
 


I remember one
        time when we were at the peak of our succsess we would have contests to
        see who could get the most ass in one night , and Mel & Scorp were
        always roommates , and me & Cowboy were roommates ; and I remember
        specifically that Cowboy came in first , and I came in second. This was
        when we were touring with Rick James & Teena Marie , Cameo , The
        Barkays , Confunkshun , Switch , The Commodores  when Lionel Ritchie
        was still with them.
 


Not to
        get too far off subject , but how were you received by those groups. 


 


Well at first
        with some reluctance. A group like Cameo , we were in awe of the their
        stage show & their presence. Like they had a walk , where they would
        walk in formation and everyone in the group  looked in the
        direction they walked in , not deviating from that direction. We were in
        awe of it , and trying to befriend them to get some kind of professional
        take on what they think that we needed to do to enhance our stage
        performance. They were on some real military type shit and wouldnt
        talk to us. After awhile Larry Blackmon started talking to Flash , but
        until we studied their stage show we weren't on their level.  We
        sat in the audience every night and studied them. We were on a six month
        tour , and about two months into the tour we started bustin they ass !!
        When we started we were the opening act , but by the end of the tour we
        had to close the shows. Unless maybe Rick James was on that date we had
        to close. Even when he was there sometimes he would be too physically
        exhausted to take the show over the top , and he would have us close it.
 


Cowboys
        signature was the crowd motivation. Cowboy was actually the first Emcee.
        I was the last member to join the group and when Cowboy joined I was
        probably too young  to go to
        parties , or I may have been at my first Kool Herc party when Cowboy
        started Emceeing. Nobody was rhyming on beat and doing crowd response
        before Cowboy. Not Hollywood  -
        nobody.
 


But that
        concert where Cowboy got stabbed in Des Moines , Iowa we were doing a
        show with Midnight Star & some more acts. Someone announced to the
        crowd that we were there and refused to go on ; but they failed to tell
        them that the reason why was because the promoter didnt have our
        money. The whole crowd seemed incited to come to our dressing room and
        confront us by one seemingly drunk individual. This guy along with about
        5000 other people came to our dressing room . We were working out and
        Cowboy had a dumbbell in his hand that was maybe 50 lbs or so. We were
        in the conference center of this hotel , and people were picking up
        ceramic ashtrays and flower pots and launching them with all their might
        at our dressing room door. If we werent so angry about it , it could
        have been a very intimidating and life threatening situation. Cowboy set
        it off by throwing the dumbbell at the door , and it burst open. I think
        that the crowd thought that we were shooting at them so they dispursed.
        We went out to confront the people still talking trash including the
        drunk guy. Cowboy , EZ Mike & someone else picked up a conference
        table  and kind of like on the old Batman & Robin when they
        picked up a table and ran with it and pinned the guy to the wall with
        the table. The drunken guy pulls out a knife and Cowboy & the guy
        begin wrestling and thats where the stitches came from.
 


I
        listened to The Message lp the other day and I heard Dreamin
        and You Are in their entirety for the first time , and they are
        very well written and produced  did you write them both?
 


I wrote Dreamin
        and a guy named Gary Henry wrote You Are. Christopher Williams and
        I wrote Dreamin together. I told the Robinsons that someone
        else wrote the song with me , but they left him out.
 


After
        the split did both factions get along?


 


For awhile we
        were arch enemies. In fact I think Step Off was directed towards
        me in some ways. When I first got in the group , and for awhile after I
        was seen as the best next to Mel. I guess that was Mels way of lettin
        me know that he is gonna be who he is without me.
 


When if
        ever did drug use begin to affect the performance of the group?


 


Strangely
        enough I think our performance was never affected , but more so our
        judgement , and how we conducted our business. We are in the music
        business and a lot of people in that era took the business part for
        granted , because we were having fun , and traveling to places where
        most people our age , or people in general wouldnt see in their
        lifetime  and we got paid for it. Ultimately I think that played a
        part in the demise of the group , and it became visible around 1983. We
        had been dabbling from 1979 till about 83. It came to a head in about
        83  especially for me , and I have no problem talking about it
        because I am 19 years clean drug free.
 


You
        look younger today than you did 20 years ago in the 80s.
 


Thank You. I
        think that I am still supposed to be here doin this , and thats
        the reason.
 


How did
        you improvise live for Mels solo joints?


 


Well I did
        Duke Bootees parts. Even in the Message video I lipsync his parts.
        Originally I did his parts on the song , but Sylvia got mad at me
        because my mom got us a lawyer. Right before we recorded the Message I
        was 17 and my mom was supposed to sign the contract for me and never
        did. When I turned 18 she got us a lawyer who advised us against signing
        it at all. She was mad at my mom , so she didnt allow my voice on the
        song.
 


Where is
        the reluctance to perform with Flash coming from?


 


From Flash.
        When we started to make records , and when we became recording artists
        his role signifigantly changed , and he is uncomfortable with the role
        that he plays. He didnt have much of a voice in where we went
        creatively , even though we listened to his suggestions a great deal ,
        but when it came time to record Sylvia made the final call , and took
        all credit for production
 


 



                                    
        
NEICY
        (Cowboys Sister)



 



 



JayQuan
        : To your knowledge how did Cowboy get into music ?


 


Neicy
        (Cowboys Sister) : He used to be in the house bangin on furniture and
        just rhymin. He used to get all the guys from the block  , and they would form a circle & do their thing. This was
        before he met any of the Furious 5.


 


JQ:
        Did he know any of the members of The Furious 5 , before they formed the
        group?


 


N:
        He knew of them. They were basically just doin the same thing that my
        brother was doin. They didnt go to the same schools or anything
        like that.


 


JQ:
        When they first started making records what was it like in your
        household?


 


N:
        Well , Flash was by himself , doin block parties or whatever  and my
        brother would just get on the mic. He was
        the only one that would get up there , and he was a crowd pleaser by
        himself. Then the rest of the guys came along one by one. When they
        started making records it was real exciting. I got a chance to do some
        traveling with them , mostly when they were in New York. Scorpio & I
        have a child together also.


 


JQ
        : Was that awkward dating Scorpio , being that he was in a group with
        your brother? Were there any problems between the 2 as a result?


 


N:
        No , not at all.


 


JQ:
        I have heard that Cowboy was nice with his hands


 


N:
        I didnt wanna go there with you ,cus thats my brother and I
        didnt want it to sound like I was braggin about that , but anytime
        the group had any static my brother was there , and took up for the
        whole group. Thats how he got 76 stitches in a stabbing incedent.


 


JQ:
        I heard his rhyme where he says been rockin that party 9 years of my
        life  been shot wit a gun/stabbed wit a knife ......
 


N:
        Yep. If there was ever a time when promoters didnt wanna pay , Cowboy
        would handle that , and get everybody paid.


 


JQ:
        When you traveled with them , did you get a chance to meet any other
        celebrities?


N:
        Oh yeah  Rick James , Eddie Murphy- lots of people


 


JQ:
        Im told by more than one person that Cowboy started the term Hip Hop


 


N:
        Yeah , you know how he started it?


 


J
        :Yes.


 


N:
        What did you hear?


 


J:
        I heard that someone was going to the army , and he was teasin em
        goin  Hip/Hop/Hip/Hop.


 


N:
        Yep , Yep thats it.and then he started goin further into the
        Hip Hip Hop bop bop ya dont stop he even had us goin along
        with him. We didnt know what he was sayin , but we went right
        along


 


J:
        Did you ever go to the studio while they were recording?


 


N:
        Yes. We met Joey & Sylvia Robinson.


 


J:
        It always sounded like a party in the background of those records , and
        I wondered if that was family members or what.


 


N:
        Yeah , my mother and I


 


J:
        Whats your favorite record by them?


 


N:
        The Message.


 



 



KID CREOLE
 



 



 



Creole:..On that term Hip Hop. A
        friend of ours named Billy was about to go to the Army 
        , I think this was 75. We had a party at the Black Door over
        on Boston Rd & 170th St. That was one of the first places
        that my brother , my self & Cowboy played as the 3 Emcees , along
        with Flash. This was Billys last weekend before shipping out , and
        Cowboy was on the mic playin around doing that Army cadence : Hip /
        Hop/Hip /Hop . But he was doin it to music and people was diggin
        on it. So we never thought much of it. Disco was king at the time , and
        the Disco crowd referred to us as those Hip Hoppers , but they
        used it as a  derogatory
        term. But Cowboy was the first one I heard do that to music , as part of
        his crowd response.
 


JayQuan: So he did something similar
        to what Wonder Mike is doin at the beginning of Rappers Delight?
 


Cre: Except for all that ole bang
        bang boogie shit  , the
        intro to Rappers Delight is what Cowboy used to say. Word for word
        except that up jump the boogie shit. Up jump the boogie was some disco
        shit.
 


JQ: When I ask some of the first
        Emcees who the first person was that they saw Emcee they usually say
        either you , Mel or Cowboy. But many times they say just Cowboy. Where
        as far as you know did he get it from?
 


Cre: Well Cowboy never really wrote
        rhymes. He would say like lil nursery rhymes like everybody else. The
        first person that I heard say a rhymeand not just a phrase , like at
        Hercs parties where Clark Kent & Timmy Tim would say givin 
        ya more than what you paid at the door , on down to the A.M. The
        first person that I heard say a rhyme that wasnt a nursery rhyme was
        my brother Mel. He was the very first person that I saw say a rhyme about
        themselves. Not a poem , a bonafide rhyme. Thats what motivated me to
        rhyme , cus Mel was on the mic and he was getting girls. I couldnt
        just stand on the sidelines. Cowboy was a guy who had no fear of just
        getting in front of a crowd , and asking them to do what he wanted. It
        was a time when people in Hip Hop werent doing that. The only other
        person who did it to any degree , on purpose was  D.J.Hollywood. Let me tell you a story about Cowboy.
 


We had just made Freedom. Cowboy got
        into a beef with his girl and  it
        escalated into a misunderstanding. Well her brother got involved. I was
        at my sisters house and it was like 1 in the morning , and we all had
        these mini  motorcycles. Ni**as called me at 1 in the mornin& I got
        my lil brother on the back. We all met over at Cowboys house in the
        Bronx - Crotona Park North off of Prospect Ave. Her brother had his people
        were out there , Cowboys stepfather  Duke had his hardware , I had mine so
        we werent worried about somebody doin something stupid. Plus this
        was like 1980 so we didnt have a mentality like we were gonna go hurt
        nobody , but Cowboy didnt appreciate them comin up into his crib ,
        and he had to leave out of the fire escape window to get away from
        them!!! So it comes down to Cowboy is about to fight this girls brother.
        So we go in the park right across the street , and Cowboy and this dude
        square off. Cowboy hit him with about 3 good shots to his headboom
        boom boom the kid bent over ; fights over. Thats my word !!! If
        you got him mad , Cowboy would ball his fist up and be ready to fight
        right then & there , no question. If you got him riled up you
        couldnt talk to him.
 


..another time in about 82 or
        so we were on a Tiger Flowers (promotion company) tour in Des Moines
        Iowa. We were doin a show on a Tuesday cus during the week the
        tour wasnt rolling, and we did a show at the Holiday Inn in the
        ballroom. We were getting like 4000 dollars for the show , but at
        that time we were usually getting like 12,000 dollars so it didnt 
        mean that much to us  just something to keep us goin. When
        we got there it was a nice crowd , and we 
        would have gone on in front of 12 people just so the promoter
        paid us. The promoter was like the town pimp from all accounts 
        , and to make a long story short he didnt come up with the
        money. We werent gonna go on , because we dont make it a habit of
        doing shows without getting paid first. We were in the dressing room and
        here comes the bootleg promoter with a couple other guys saying that he
        is gonna make us go on. The promoter stuck his foot in the door so that
        we couldnt close it , and one of our security guys  Joe was
        closing the door on the guys foot. When the crowd found out what was
        goin on , they started throwing everything that wasnt nailed down.
        They turned on us along with the promoter and his boys. It sounded like
        100 people knocking at the door. We were in the dressing room , and our
        bus is outside. They were tearing up the Holiday Inn & the police
        werent comin. Mel was into weights even back then and we had a
        bunch in the dressing room , so we took them apart 
        - anything that we could use for a weapon.
Mel
        used to bring a baseball bat onstage 
        , and we had that. I had a weight bar. We decided that we had to
        make it to the bus. We counted to 3 , there was maybe 11 or 12 of us .we
        busted out the door and started wailing on people. They were throwing
        stuff at us , and we were trying to protect ourselves. The promoter
        tries to make his way to us with a knife. Cowboy grabs him & starts
        to tussle , and the guy is bigger than Cowboy. The guy stabs Cowboy
        twice. Reggie & Joe  two of our security men take a table and run
        the guy up against the wall with it. Cowboy had like 12 stitches in his
        arm and 6 in his side. The next day we did a show.thats the kind
        of trooper he was. The next day we were performing !
 



 



JQ:
        Im gonna ask you about some Furious 5 recordings , and I want you to
        tell me the first thought , memory or story associated with that song.


 


Freedom
         ahhh
        the very first time that we went on a real concert tour it was so
        foreign to have a big crowd , and fans come afterwards. Also to have
        people recognize you. We were known in the Bronx to some degree cus
        we did our thing , but not in this way. It would be even different today
        because you have MTV & the media involved in Hip Hop. For instance
        when I went with Flash & Rahiem and our new line up we went on the
        Fresh Fest tour and got arrested in Providence Rhode Island for beatin
        up a bootleg t shirt seller. There was no media coverage except right
        there in Providence. If that was today it would be on MTV news , the
        internet and everywhere. But our lives just changed. We went from being
        a regional act that played in gymnasiums , and if we were lucky
        gymnasiums that had a stage ; to going on tours in different cities and
        playing arenas that basketball teams played in. Real teams that we knew
        of , and eventually some of the players attended our shows. It was
        incredibly exciting. 


 


Its
        Nasty  Thats
        when we started goin to the South a lot and doing more shows. Also
        going overseas. The first time we went to London we fit right in with
        all the wild dressing  the leather pants , studs & spikes.


 


JQ:
        - Is it true that when you opened up for the Clash the crowd booed you?


 


CRE:
        Yeah that was right here in the states !! That was in Manhattan at Bonds
        International. It used to be a clothing store , but when they went out
        of business it was turned into a club. When we first started doin
        shows the second set of uniforms that we bought were black velvet with
        rhinestones , but this was a rock crowd  and people had stayed 2 or 3
        days outside of Bonds International waitin for tickets. We had just
        done Freedom and we had to do 2 shows. The crowd had the wild hair dos
        and black lipstick , you know a Punk Rock crowd. Well Hip Hop wasnt
        like that back then  they didnt wanna hear it AT ALL !!!They
        started throwing stuff at us. Flash got so nervous that his ear started
        bleeding & sh*t !!!! The second show we wore our dungarees 
        and we threw stuff back !!!


 


Birthday
        Party: We
        released that right after Freedom. We did a lot of commercials for radio
        stations off of Birthday Party. That song was basically Mels idea.


 


The
        Message : None
        of us really wanted to do it. Especially the rest of us , because we
        didnt really have a part in it. Before the Message anything that we
        wanted to say creatively we said it. Now someone was telling us that we
        couldnt say anything. After awhile Sylvia made up her mind that we
        were the right type of group to do that song , coming from the inner
        city and everything. We would be believable doing it , and none of her
        other groups would. But she was gonna have her way on that one , as far
        as Mel being the only one to do that song. It worked out for the best ,
        but I wish that I had gotten the chance to say somethin on it though.
        The rest of us came up with the idea for the arrest skit at the end so
        that we would have a chance to say something.


 


Showdown
        : Was
        Sugarhill Gang in the studio with you?.Nah we recorded that at
        different times. Them fake Emcees didnt wanna be in the same room
        with us.


 


JQ:
        Why was Cowboy not pictured on the On The Strength photo sessions?
         


 


CRE: He had just gotten out of
        jail , which made it possible for Elektra to sign us as a group. I was
        ok with the group getting back together , but I wish that we could have
        still kept our faction together.
 


JQ
        : What was the most memorable time that you had on the road with either
        the original line up , or the group after the split?


 


CRE:
        The Tiger Flower tours with the original group because they were
        professional tours and we would go on the radio 
        in different cities , it was a lot of fun.


 


Another
        thing about Cowboy was that he was a huge Dallas Cowboy fan. Thats
        not why we called him Cowboy (it was because of his bow legs , and he
        walked like the Cowboys on the old westerns). He was very athletic also.
        Him and Mel were always doing push ups together & stuff like that
        .He was always playing basketball & football. It really surprised me
        when he started messin with crack. I can also say that he loved his kids
        , Cowboy really loved his kids. The people that represent us as far as
        people using our stuff , they make sure that he gets his 1/5 th
        percentage.


 


JQ:
        Not to get too personal , but is that 
        a good source of income for you? I know that Will Smith & LL
        Cool J have used some of your stuff.


 


CRE:
        It aint enough to get that Benz that I want , but it helps every now
        & again. 


 


But
        lastly about Cowboy , when he was alive and we started to do parties
        together he & I used to smoke dust together , we lived in the same
        neighborhood and we were best friends. We were mad mad close. Before we
        started making records together we hung out everyday. Its not fair to
        say that we were like brothers , but we were mad close. The fact that
        the industry does not recognize or try to remember Cowboy is bad for me.
        We didnt do all that much in the industry where they might give a
        tribute to him , but he did a lot for the seed that grew , and the terms
        that he used are still used till this day. It's sad that the group
        couldnt stay together long enough to make sure that Cowboys memory
        was firmly entrenched in Hip Hop history. Its disappointing that Hip Hop
        turned its back on Cowboy  not that someone purposely tried to make
        sure that his name is not recognized in the industry , but im just
        disappointed that its not .


 


 


JQ:
        What are your 3 favorite breakbeats to rhyme over , and give me 2
        honorable mentions.


 


CRE
        : A joint by Passport called Ju Ju Man , Sing ,Sing, Sing
        & way way back before we started rhyming rhythmically I liked to
        rhyme to the Bra. Two honorable mentions are I Cant Stop
        & Apache.


 


 


JQ
        : What is your favorite song that you made after the split?


 


CRE
        : Larrys Dance Theme.


 


JQ:
        Lastly when you guys performed the song Scorpio on stage , how was
        it done being that the song had the vocorder in it?


 


CRE:
        We just let it play & kinda talked over it. We wanted to bring a
        vocorder on stage , but Sylvia would have to pay for it , and make an
        instrumental copy , and she never wanted to do anything to enhance the
        group in that sense.........
