Financial Planning Frequently Asked Questions
Why do I need a financial advisor?
You may need a financial advisor because you need someone to guide you toward financial flexibility. Even with a steady source of income and relatively little debt, a job loss, market crash, or other emergency could destroy your sense of financial security.You need an experienced financial planner who can guide you through each financial change as it occurs. As a result, you will gain peace of mind.
What makes Lowe Wealth Advisors different?
Our firm is distinguished by the depth that our Certified Financial Planners® contribute. With male and female staff members from several generations, we offer well-rounded experience in identifying and managing your potential financial risks.
With Lowe Wealth Advisors, you’ll receive advice from all four members of our team – unlike other firms that only give you access to one financial advisor. Our team brings decades of experience regarding risk management, as well as a strong commitment to personalized service.
I already have a financial advisor. How difficult will the transfer from my current financial advisor to Lowe Wealth Advisors be?
At Lowe Wealth Advisors, our goal is to ease your financial stress, especially as you, transition to our services from another provider. We will ensure a simple transfer to our services, regardless of how long you have been working with your present financial advisor. Our three-step process does the work for you and just requires your signature. Call 443-766-7160 to learn more.
What are the differences between fee-based and commission-based advisors?
Fee-based advisors are independent, meaning that we do not answer to a parent company, nor are we obligated to sell a parent company’s services. Our fiduciary responsibility is to you, only.
Who makes good clients for Lowe Wealth Advisors?
Lowe Wealth Advisors helps individuals, families, and companies of all shapes and sizes across the United States achieve their vision for financial success.

Why Lowe Wealth Advisors? / Process 


Process

The Investment Process of Lowe Wealth Advisors
To help you achieve your financial vision, our focus at Lowe Wealth Advisors is equally on managing your financial risks and helping you achieve potential returns.* Our investment management philosophy is to identify financial risks, then attempt to mitigate them through responsible financial planning and portfolio investment management.

By serving as our clients’ financial watchmen, we do our best to alleviate your financial anxiety by simplifying complex concepts and keeping you informed always. Clients can learn how we help manage their wealth thanks to our six-step investment process.


Analyze. Through thorough research, we evaluate the market and economy. We also create a “Risk Budget” for your portfolio, addressing all the financial risks you face.
Diversify. We merge our research with your personal Risk Budget to develop your target asset allocation. Core positions are your portfolio’s foundation. They are typically held longer than tactical positions, but both tactics work in tandem to identify potential opportunities or potential risks.
Evaluate. Combining your core and tactical positions with our extensive research, we determine what we believe to be the ideal manager for each target investment category within your given asset allocation.
Execute. Before allocating your portfolio, we consider any restrictions, tax issues, or other complications you wish to avoid.
Confirm. We have an active management style, but that does not equate to market timing or chasing returns. Our approach to active management attempts to limit the downside in portfolios. We implement a weekly, monthly, and quarterly process to confirm, evaluate, and adjust our strategies as appropriate.
Rebalance. We review your portfolio and determine any new or changing Risk Budget factors. Your core positions are rebalanced, and the process begins again.

*It is impossible to completely eliminate risk in any portfolio. Asset allocation can help to minimize certain types of risk; however, you may still be subject to market risk, industry risk, sector risk, and interest rate risks. Our goal is to help you manage risk in the manner that best matches your goals.

Life Pivot Points / Separation or Divorce 


Separation or Divorce

Suddenly Single
Important legal, tax, and financial considerations after a separation or divorce
After a separation or divorce, you may be inclined to make impulsive financial decisions. But making things easier today can make them more difficult in the future.
During your marriage, did you or your spouse make most of the financial decisions? Regardless of your experience, seek professional help in planning for negotiation.
Achieving Negotiation Success
Assemble Your Financial Team
Before making any decisions, assemble a trusted team of legal, tax, and financial advisors. They can help you remove your emotions from the equation while calculating your long-term success. Find a CFP® who can help:

Understand the tax implications of your assets and settlement opportunities
Develop a cash flow plan that will help you during negotiations
Work with your accountant and attorney to give you an unbiased picture of your situation
Define your financial vision
Provide a realistic perspective on challenges that might prevent you from achieving your goals

Remember Your Role in the Negotiation Process
Your financial planner will help guide you. But you need to take a healthy interest in the negotiation process, too, by doing the following:

Avoid emotional attachment. Because of taxes and other costs, it may be more financially expedient to sell rather than keep cherished assets
Be engaged. Request a weekly email update from your advisors, and hold them accountable for the timeline they have given you.
Consider mediation. Don’t spend $10,000 to get $1,000. Many divorcees prefer mediation to traditional proceedings.

Quick action is just one of many mistakes associated with separation and divorce. If you’re unaccustomed to handling the financial decisions, you could easily fall victim. During this difficult time, you deserve a team that can contribute decades of experience to your negotiation success.
