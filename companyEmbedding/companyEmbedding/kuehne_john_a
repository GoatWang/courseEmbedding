History[edit]
Early years and evolution: 1890 - 1950s[edit]
The origins of Kuehne + Nagel[6] was in 1890, when August Kühne and Friedrich Nagel founded a forwarding commission agency in Bremen, Germany. It initially used to concentrate on cotton and consolidated freight. Later in 1902, it expanded its operations to the German seaport city of Hamburg.[3]
In 1907, the co-founder Friedrich Nagel died, and August Kühne took over his shares in the company. The legacy of Nagel still lives on, in the company's name - Kuehne + Nagel (KN). The First World War greatly affected its businesses.
Upon Kühne's death in 1932, his sons - Alfred and Werner - became partners in the firm. Adolf Maass (1875 - probably early in 1945 in Auschwitz concentration camp), who was Jewish, a partner, and the firm's largest shareholder with a 45% stake, was forced out in April 1933. On the 1st of May 1933 Alfred and Werner Kühne joined the Nazi Party,[7] and under the brothers' management the firm played a prominent role in the transport of property seized from Jews in occupied territories.[8][9]
Transition to a Swiss holding co., and expansion: 1950s - 1990s[edit]
In the early 1950s, Alfred Kühne initiated the company's international expansion; and KN expanded its operations into Canada, with the opening of branch offices in Toronto and Montreal. In 1963, KN took a controlling stake in Athens based Proodos S.A, and also expanded into Italy. In 1975, the company adopted a holding company structure, with the formation of Kuehne + Nagel International AG based in Schindellegi, Switzerland, as the ultimate holding company.
In the mid-1960s, a third-generation member of the Kühne family, Klaus-Michael Kühne joined his father Alfred Kühne as a junior partner, having completed an apprenticeship in banking. In 1966, at the age of 30, he joined the management team as executive chairman; and spearheaded KN's future expansions, particularly its European and the Far Eastern operations.
In 1981, Alfred Kühne died; and in July the same year, due to the losses sustained by the Kühne family in attempting to expand its shipping fleet, a 50% stake in KN was sold to the British conglomerate Lonrho Plc for 90 million DM. Following the purchase, Klaus-Michael Kühne and Lonrho's head, Roland "Tiny" Rowland acted as joint chief executives of the combined organisation. KN further expanded with its acquisition of freight companies: Domenichelli SpA (Italy), Van Vliet BV (Netherlands), Hollis Transport Group Ltd. (UK), Transportes Tres (Spain), and other acquisitions in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Further expansion: 1990s - present[edit]
The 1990 German reunification was an important event for many German companies, including KN; and provided them the necessary impetus to expand further. After the reunification, KN integrated its network in the former German Democratic Republic, and consolidated its operations. In 1992, it bought back Lonrho plc's 50% stake in the company; and went public in May 1994. It was listed on the Zurich and Frankfurt exchanges, which provided a platform for further exchange-based acquisitions. The same year, KN established a Russian subsidiary; and pushed ahead into Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.[10]
In the mid 1990s, strategic focus given to expand the lucrative logistics-related contracts / operations paid off - one being with DuPont in which KN would operate the chemical giant's leveraged distribution activities in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In July 1999, Kühne handed over the post of CEO to Klaus Herms, and continued as the executive chairman and president of the board.
In the early 2000s, KN got a foothold in the Asia Pacific contract logistics market, when it forged a strategic alliance with Singapore-based SembCorp Logistics. In 2001, it acquired USCO Logistics Inc. - a warehouse-based logistics service provider based in Hamden, Connecticut, for US$300 million. KN and SembCorp chose to follow different strategic paths in 2004, and ended their strategic partnership.[11]
In October 2007, the board of KN appointed Reinhard Lange as the successor to CEO Klaus Herms, effective June 2009 to ensure a smooth handover. The succession plan was similar to the SAP's 2007 CEO transition plan from Henning Kagermann to Léo Apotheker, which received praise in the media.[12]
In 2012, Kuehne + Nagel acquired the business contracts of Canada’s Perishables International Transportation (PIT) to expand into global fresh and frozen foods network.[13]
In September 2013, Kuehne + Nagel agreed to merge its railfreight business with VTG to form VTG Rail Logistics, which would be Europe's largest private railfreight business when it starts operations in 2014.[14]
In April 2014, Kuehne + Nagel International was fined $3.1 million for its part in a freight forwarding cartel case brought by the Commerce Commission. Kuehne + Nagel was the last defendant in the seven-year investigation involving six firms, who referred to themselves as the "Gardening Club" and used horticultural code to discuss anti-competitive practices among them. The regulator's investigation uncovered emails that referred to agreed surcharges as "the new price for asparagus for the forthcoming season" or "the price of marrows".[15][16][17][18]
Organization[edit]
The group employs approximately 66,000 people in 1000 offices in more than 100 countries and has approximately 7 million sqm of warehouse space under management.[19] It is organised in the following seven geographical divisions:[3]

History[edit]
Early years and evolution: 1890 - 1950s[edit]
The origins of Kuehne + Nagel[6] was in 1890, when August Kühne and Friedrich Nagel founded a forwarding commission agency in Bremen, Germany. It initially used to concentrate on cotton and consolidated freight. Later in 1902, it expanded its operations to the German seaport city of Hamburg.[3]
In 1907, the co-founder Friedrich Nagel died, and August Kühne took over his shares in the company. The legacy of Nagel still lives on, in the company's name - Kuehne + Nagel (KN). The First World War greatly affected its businesses.
Upon Kühne's death in 1932, his sons - Alfred and Werner - became partners in the firm. Adolf Maass (1875 - probably early in 1945 in Auschwitz concentration camp), who was Jewish, a partner, and the firm's largest shareholder with a 45% stake, was forced out in April 1933. On the 1st of May 1933 Alfred and Werner Kühne joined the Nazi Party,[7] and under the brothers' management the firm played a prominent role in the transport of property seized from Jews in occupied territories.[8][9]
Transition to a Swiss holding co., and expansion: 1950s - 1990s[edit]
In the early 1950s, Alfred Kühne initiated the company's international expansion; and KN expanded its operations into Canada, with the opening of branch offices in Toronto and Montreal. In 1963, KN took a controlling stake in Athens based Proodos S.A, and also expanded into Italy. In 1975, the company adopted a holding company structure, with the formation of Kuehne + Nagel International AG based in Schindellegi, Switzerland, as the ultimate holding company.
In the mid-1960s, a third-generation member of the Kühne family, Klaus-Michael Kühne joined his father Alfred Kühne as a junior partner, having completed an apprenticeship in banking. In 1966, at the age of 30, he joined the management team as executive chairman; and spearheaded KN's future expansions, particularly its European and the Far Eastern operations.
In 1981, Alfred Kühne died; and in July the same year, due to the losses sustained by the Kühne family in attempting to expand its shipping fleet, a 50% stake in KN was sold to the British conglomerate Lonrho Plc for 90 million DM. Following the purchase, Klaus-Michael Kühne and Lonrho's head, Roland "Tiny" Rowland acted as joint chief executives of the combined organisation. KN further expanded with its acquisition of freight companies: Domenichelli SpA (Italy), Van Vliet BV (Netherlands), Hollis Transport Group Ltd. (UK), Transportes Tres (Spain), and other acquisitions in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Further expansion: 1990s - present[edit]
The 1990 German reunification was an important event for many German companies, including KN; and provided them the necessary impetus to expand further. After the reunification, KN integrated its network in the former German Democratic Republic, and consolidated its operations. In 1992, it bought back Lonrho plc's 50% stake in the company; and went public in May 1994. It was listed on the Zurich and Frankfurt exchanges, which provided a platform for further exchange-based acquisitions. The same year, KN established a Russian subsidiary; and pushed ahead into Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.[10]
In the mid 1990s, strategic focus given to expand the lucrative logistics-related contracts / operations paid off - one being with DuPont in which KN would operate the chemical giant's leveraged distribution activities in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In July 1999, Kühne handed over the post of CEO to Klaus Herms, and continued as the executive chairman and president of the board.
In the early 2000s, KN got a foothold in the Asia Pacific contract logistics market, when it forged a strategic alliance with Singapore-based SembCorp Logistics. In 2001, it acquired USCO Logistics Inc. - a warehouse-based logistics service provider based in Hamden, Connecticut, for US$300 million. KN and SembCorp chose to follow different strategic paths in 2004, and ended their strategic partnership.[11]
In October 2007, the board of KN appointed Reinhard Lange as the successor to CEO Klaus Herms, effective June 2009 to ensure a smooth handover. The succession plan was similar to the SAP's 2007 CEO transition plan from Henning Kagermann to Léo Apotheker, which received praise in the media.[12]
In 2012, Kuehne + Nagel acquired the business contracts of Canada’s Perishables International Transportation (PIT) to expand into global fresh and frozen foods network.[13]
In September 2013, Kuehne + Nagel agreed to merge its railfreight business with VTG to form VTG Rail Logistics, which would be Europe's largest private railfreight business when it starts operations in 2014.[14]
In April 2014, Kuehne + Nagel International was fined $3.1 million for its part in a freight forwarding cartel case brought by the Commerce Commission. Kuehne + Nagel was the last defendant in the seven-year investigation involving six firms, who referred to themselves as the "Gardening Club" and used horticultural code to discuss anti-competitive practices among them. The regulator's investigation uncovered emails that referred to agreed surcharges as "the new price for asparagus for the forthcoming season" or "the price of marrows".[15][16][17][18]

History[edit]
Early years and evolution: 1890 - 1950s[edit]
The origins of Kuehne + Nagel[6] was in 1890, when August Kühne and Friedrich Nagel founded a forwarding commission agency in Bremen, Germany. It initially used to concentrate on cotton and consolidated freight. Later in 1902, it expanded its operations to the German seaport city of Hamburg.[3]
In 1907, the co-founder Friedrich Nagel died, and August Kühne took over his shares in the company. The legacy of Nagel still lives on, in the company's name - Kuehne + Nagel (KN). The First World War greatly affected its businesses.
Upon Kühne's death in 1932, his sons - Alfred and Werner - became partners in the firm. Adolf Maass (1875 - probably early in 1945 in Auschwitz concentration camp), who was Jewish, a partner, and the firm's largest shareholder with a 45% stake, was forced out in April 1933. On the 1st of May 1933 Alfred and Werner Kühne joined the Nazi Party,[7] and under the brothers' management the firm played a prominent role in the transport of property seized from Jews in occupied territories.[8][9]
Transition to a Swiss holding co., and expansion: 1950s - 1990s[edit]
In the early 1950s, Alfred Kühne initiated the company's international expansion; and KN expanded its operations into Canada, with the opening of branch offices in Toronto and Montreal. In 1963, KN took a controlling stake in Athens based Proodos S.A, and also expanded into Italy. In 1975, the company adopted a holding company structure, with the formation of Kuehne + Nagel International AG based in Schindellegi, Switzerland, as the ultimate holding company.
In the mid-1960s, a third-generation member of the Kühne family, Klaus-Michael Kühne joined his father Alfred Kühne as a junior partner, having completed an apprenticeship in banking. In 1966, at the age of 30, he joined the management team as executive chairman; and spearheaded KN's future expansions, particularly its European and the Far Eastern operations.
In 1981, Alfred Kühne died; and in July the same year, due to the losses sustained by the Kühne family in attempting to expand its shipping fleet, a 50% stake in KN was sold to the British conglomerate Lonrho Plc for 90 million DM. Following the purchase, Klaus-Michael Kühne and Lonrho's head, Roland "Tiny" Rowland acted as joint chief executives of the combined organisation. KN further expanded with its acquisition of freight companies: Domenichelli SpA (Italy), Van Vliet BV (Netherlands), Hollis Transport Group Ltd. (UK), Transportes Tres (Spain), and other acquisitions in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Further expansion: 1990s - present[edit]
The 1990 German reunification was an important event for many German companies, including KN; and provided them the necessary impetus to expand further. After the reunification, KN integrated its network in the former German Democratic Republic, and consolidated its operations. In 1992, it bought back Lonrho plc's 50% stake in the company; and went public in May 1994. It was listed on the Zurich and Frankfurt exchanges, which provided a platform for further exchange-based acquisitions. The same year, KN established a Russian subsidiary; and pushed ahead into Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.[10]
In the mid 1990s, strategic focus given to expand the lucrative logistics-related contracts / operations paid off - one being with DuPont in which KN would operate the chemical giant's leveraged distribution activities in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In July 1999, Kühne handed over the post of CEO to Klaus Herms, and continued as the executive chairman and president of the board.
In the early 2000s, KN got a foothold in the Asia Pacific contract logistics market, when it forged a strategic alliance with Singapore-based SembCorp Logistics. In 2001, it acquired USCO Logistics Inc. - a warehouse-based logistics service provider based in Hamden, Connecticut, for US$300 million. KN and SembCorp chose to follow different strategic paths in 2004, and ended their strategic partnership.[11]
In October 2007, the board of KN appointed Reinhard Lange as the successor to CEO Klaus Herms, effective June 2009 to ensure a smooth handover. The succession plan was similar to the SAP's 2007 CEO transition plan from Henning Kagermann to Léo Apotheker, which received praise in the media.[12]
In 2012, Kuehne + Nagel acquired the business contracts of Canada’s Perishables International Transportation (PIT) to expand into global fresh and frozen foods network.[13]
In September 2013, Kuehne + Nagel agreed to merge its railfreight business with VTG to form VTG Rail Logistics, which would be Europe's largest private railfreight business when it starts operations in 2014.[14]
In April 2014, Kuehne + Nagel International was fined $3.1 million for its part in a freight forwarding cartel case brought by the Commerce Commission. Kuehne + Nagel was the last defendant in the seven-year investigation involving six firms, who referred to themselves as the "Gardening Club" and used horticultural code to discuss anti-competitive practices among them. The regulator's investigation uncovered emails that referred to agreed surcharges as "the new price for asparagus for the forthcoming season" or "the price of marrows".[15][16][17][18]

History[edit]
Early years and evolution: 1890 - 1950s[edit]
The origins of Kuehne + Nagel[6] was in 1890, when August Kühne and Friedrich Nagel founded a forwarding commission agency in Bremen, Germany. It initially used to concentrate on cotton and consolidated freight. Later in 1902, it expanded its operations to the German seaport city of Hamburg.[3]
In 1907, the co-founder Friedrich Nagel died, and August Kühne took over his shares in the company. The legacy of Nagel still lives on, in the company's name - Kuehne + Nagel (KN). The First World War greatly affected its businesses.
Upon Kühne's death in 1932, his sons - Alfred and Werner - became partners in the firm. Adolf Maass (1875 - probably early in 1945 in Auschwitz concentration camp), who was Jewish, a partner, and the firm's largest shareholder with a 45% stake, was forced out in April 1933. On the 1st of May 1933 Alfred and Werner Kühne joined the Nazi Party,[7] and under the brothers' management the firm played a prominent role in the transport of property seized from Jews in occupied territories.[8][9]
Transition to a Swiss holding co., and expansion: 1950s - 1990s[edit]
In the early 1950s, Alfred Kühne initiated the company's international expansion; and KN expanded its operations into Canada, with the opening of branch offices in Toronto and Montreal. In 1963, KN took a controlling stake in Athens based Proodos S.A, and also expanded into Italy. In 1975, the company adopted a holding company structure, with the formation of Kuehne + Nagel International AG based in Schindellegi, Switzerland, as the ultimate holding company.
In the mid-1960s, a third-generation member of the Kühne family, Klaus-Michael Kühne joined his father Alfred Kühne as a junior partner, having completed an apprenticeship in banking. In 1966, at the age of 30, he joined the management team as executive chairman; and spearheaded KN's future expansions, particularly its European and the Far Eastern operations.
In 1981, Alfred Kühne died; and in July the same year, due to the losses sustained by the Kühne family in attempting to expand its shipping fleet, a 50% stake in KN was sold to the British conglomerate Lonrho Plc for 90 million DM. Following the purchase, Klaus-Michael Kühne and Lonrho's head, Roland "Tiny" Rowland acted as joint chief executives of the combined organisation. KN further expanded with its acquisition of freight companies: Domenichelli SpA (Italy), Van Vliet BV (Netherlands), Hollis Transport Group Ltd. (UK), Transportes Tres (Spain), and other acquisitions in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Further expansion: 1990s - present[edit]
The 1990 German reunification was an important event for many German companies, including KN; and provided them the necessary impetus to expand further. After the reunification, KN integrated its network in the former German Democratic Republic, and consolidated its operations. In 1992, it bought back Lonrho plc's 50% stake in the company; and went public in May 1994. It was listed on the Zurich and Frankfurt exchanges, which provided a platform for further exchange-based acquisitions. The same year, KN established a Russian subsidiary; and pushed ahead into Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.[10]
In the mid 1990s, strategic focus given to expand the lucrative logistics-related contracts / operations paid off - one being with DuPont in which KN would operate the chemical giant's leveraged distribution activities in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In July 1999, Kühne handed over the post of CEO to Klaus Herms, and continued as the executive chairman and president of the board.
In the early 2000s, KN got a foothold in the Asia Pacific contract logistics market, when it forged a strategic alliance with Singapore-based SembCorp Logistics. In 2001, it acquired USCO Logistics Inc. - a warehouse-based logistics service provider based in Hamden, Connecticut, for US$300 million. KN and SembCorp chose to follow different strategic paths in 2004, and ended their strategic partnership.[11]
In October 2007, the board of KN appointed Reinhard Lange as the successor to CEO Klaus Herms, effective June 2009 to ensure a smooth handover. The succession plan was similar to the SAP's 2007 CEO transition plan from Henning Kagermann to Léo Apotheker, which received praise in the media.[12]
In 2012, Kuehne + Nagel acquired the business contracts of Canada’s Perishables International Transportation (PIT) to expand into global fresh and frozen foods network.[13]
In September 2013, Kuehne + Nagel agreed to merge its railfreight business with VTG to form VTG Rail Logistics, which would be Europe's largest private railfreight business when it starts operations in 2014.[14]
In April 2014, Kuehne + Nagel International was fined $3.1 million for its part in a freight forwarding cartel case brought by the Commerce Commission. Kuehne + Nagel was the last defendant in the seven-year investigation involving six firms, who referred to themselves as the "Gardening Club" and used horticultural code to discuss anti-competitive practices among them. The regulator's investigation uncovered emails that referred to agreed surcharges as "the new price for asparagus for the forthcoming season" or "the price of marrows".[15][16][17][18]
Organization[edit]
The group employs approximately 66,000 people in 1000 offices in more than 100 countries and has approximately 7 million sqm of warehouse space under management.[19] It is organised in the following seven geographical divisions:[3]

KN Advisory







KN Advisory: Revised Low Sulfur Surcharges for shipments to/from the U.S.



Per our previous KN Advisory, carriers are imposing additional charges based on higher bunker costs due to mandated use of more expensive low sulfur fuel.  Please find attached our revised Low Sulfur Surcharge (LLS) chart for all shipments that have a bill of lading date of January 1, 2015 or later.  Kuehne + Nagel LLS Chart>>The following changes have been made to our previously distributed tariff chart:Defined Low Sulfur Surcharge for exports to Asia and Indian Sub-Continent (ISC) from all U.S. port ranges Addition of Low Sulfur Surcharge levels to/from South AfricaAlso, please note that Gulf ports are covered under surcharge levels reflected for the U.S. East CoastKuehne + Nagel is committed to compliance measures that reduce impact on the environment. We thank you for your understanding, and should you have any questions, please contact your local Kuehne + Nagel representative or email: seafreight.usa@kuehne-nagel.com. 



KN Advisory: PMA Calls for Federal Mediation in Negotiations with ILWU



The Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), which represents terminal operators and shipping lines at 29 West Coast ports, has requested federal mediation in its contract negotiations with the International Longshore & Warehouse Union (ILWU).  Both sides have to agree to federal mediation before the government will consider entering the talks.  A spokesman for the ILWU said the union is taking more time to study the call for a mediator.  ILWU website>>According to the PMA's released statement, the two sides remain far apart on many issues and are not close to a new contract nearly six months after their old contract expired.  ILWU slowdown actions and walk-offs have reduced productivity and caused severe congestion over the last several months, worsening already difficult conditions tied to chassis and trucker shortage, bigger ships and larger volumes. The situation is impacting shippers and truck drivers, plus creating long-term damage to the West Coast with continued loss in market share to ports on the U.S. East and Gulf coasts.  PMA statement>>Kuehne + Nagel is following the situation very closely and we will continue to keep you informed of further developments as they occur.  Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this topic, please contact your local Kuehne + Nagel representative or email: seafreight.usa@kuehne-nagel.com.



KN Advisory: Importer Security Filing for LCL



On January 26, 2009, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) began enforcing the Importer Security Filing (ISF) requirements for cargo arriving into the U.S. by ocean vessel.  The importer of record is responsible for filing the ISF through their designated agent or customs broker. If the ISF is not filed, fines may be up to $10,000 for each violation.  CBP flags more and more containers for customs hold or inspection in case ISF filing is not done properly or not done at all.  Import containers incurring detention result in additional cost for the container handling in general, not including the fines.   For LCL imports handled via Kuehne + Nagel’s own consolidation containers, any additional charges incurred for non-compliance of the ISF rules will be charged to the offending importer of record and not distributed equally to the multiple customers moving freight in the particular consolidation container.If you have any questions in regards to ISF filing, please contact your local Kuehne + Nagel representative or email: seafreight.usa@kuehne-nagel.com. Sincerely, The Kuehne + Nagel Management Team ISF is composed of 10 data elements that are required to be sent to US Customs on all import shipments arriving via sea-freight into the United States: Manufacturer (or supplier) name and addressSeller (or owner) name and addressBuyer (or owner) name and addressShip-to name and addressContainer stuffing locationConsolidator (stuffer) name and addressImporter of record number/foreign trade zone applicant identification numberConsignee number(s)Country of originCommodity Harmonized Tariff Schedule numberFrom the carrier, two data elements are required:Vessel stow planContainer status messagesThe above information is required for the Department of Homeland Security to “push out” U.S. borders. Collecting information on foreign importers 48 hours prior to the goods leaving the port of loading allows CBP to further secure U.S. ports of entry against acts of terrorism.For more detailed information about the Importer Security Filing, please visit the CBP website; click here>>.



KN Advisory: Low Sulfur Charge Effective January 1, 2015



Due to the MARPOL regulation on the use of low sulfur fuel impacting costs, effective from January 1, 2015, carriers will implement a low sulfur charge on all shipments passing to/from/via the coastal areas deemed Emissions Control Areas (ECA).   The MARPOL (The International Maritime Organization’s Marine Pollution Convention) regulation legally mandates that ships crossing the ECA in the North Atlantic, Baltic Sea, English Channel and North Sea are required to use fuel with no more than 0.1% sulfur content (down from 1%). This requires ocean carriers to switch to more refined but significantly more expensive marine gas oil.Kuehne + Nagel will apply the low sulfur charge in accordance with the attached tariff charge chart for all shipments that have a bill of lading date of January 1, 2015 or later. The charge will be trade specific and apply equally to dry/reefer cargo and headhaul/backhaul (except for transpacific trades, where we differentiate per trade direction).  Low sulfur charge levels will be reviewed frequently and adjusted with or without notice to reflect significant fluctuations in the price of low sulfur fuel. Kuehne + Nagel is committed to compliance measures that reduce impact on the environment. Our Global Facility Carbon Calculator (GFCC), available on our website, allows customers to quickly calculate and see the total CO2 emission for container and LCL movements from door to door.  We thank you for your understanding, and should you have any questions, please contact your local Kuehne + Nagel representative or email: seafreight.usa@kuehne-nagel.com. 



KN Advisory: Carriers Postpone West Coast Congestion Surcharge (Again)



Please note that all carriers have once again suspended the previously announced port congestion surcharges for any cargo moving via U.S. West Coast ports. This applies to all trades and not just to cargo originating from Asia.   The Federal Maritime Commission is currently reviewing a number of concerns into surcharge validity. We suspect this will not be the last we hear on this issue, as congestion continues to trouble all terminals in Los Angeles, Long Beach and other West Coast ports.  Kuehne + Nagel will continue to monitor this very fluid situation and will issue further advisories as the situation warrants.In the meantime, should you have any questions or require additional information, please don’t hesitate to contact your local Kuehne + Nagel representative or email: seafreight.usa@kuehne-nagel.com.Sincerely,The Kuehne + Nagel Management Team
