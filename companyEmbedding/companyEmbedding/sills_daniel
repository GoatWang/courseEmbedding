I am so saddened by the loss of this sweet soft hearted soul. Danny you have always been in my heart and you will continue on in my memories forever. I have so many memories of when you and Wes would come over before school and after escorting my daughter like true gentlemen to and from. When you and Wes would bring me veggies so I would make you kids my fresh homemade salsa.  Those were truly precious times and I thank God you were a part of my life. RIP sweets! You'll always be one of my boys.

Danny was one of the most amazing people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Anyone who was ever loved by him was truly loved. He watched over me as the sister he never had and I will never forget Fugitive, UFOs, and "Yeah" by Usher. I will miss you forever. Condolences to your family and all that loved you. You deeply touched many lives. See you on the other side Brother!

Sills Milling Co.
Locally Grown - Stone Ground





About Us    Sills Milling Co was founded in 2013 by Daniel Sills on his family farm in While County, Georgia. Daniel bought the pre-1920's William's Stone Grist Mill in Blue Ridge, Georgia in December 2012 and brought it back to the farm to begin setting up the mill. He bought a 1948 Farmall H tractor the next Spring to use to power the grist mill. Daniel set up a small building on the farm as the mill house where the grist mill, tractor, and other items are set up for operation to make cornmeal and grits.     All of the corn used to make cornmeal and grits are planted and harvested by Daniel and his family locally in White County, Georgia. He plants a Pioneer variety of white and yellow corn for a variety of cornmeal and grits to sell. The corn is planted in the Spring, dried naturally in the field, and harvested in the fall. Once harvested, the corn is stored in grain bins for easy access throughout the year.    Sills Milling Co. offers white and yellow grits and non self-rising cornmeal in two pound cloth bags as well as bulk quantities in clear plastic bags. All products are gluten free and there are absolutely no preservatives or additives. Each bag is hand stamped and sown with a personal recipe card on the back of the bag. All of the cornmeal and grits are ground fresh as orders are placed.     Sills Milling Co. products are currently sold at Jaemor Farms (Lula and Banks Crossing, GA), Adams IGA (Cleveland, GA) and Ingles Supermarket (Cleveland, GA). Sills Milling Co. cornmeal and grits are also currently used in Harvest Habersham (Clarkesville, GA) restaurant. Cornmeal and grits are also used in surrounding school systems through the Georgia Farm the School program.     Sills Milling Co. is insured, licensed by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, and Georgia Grown certified.
