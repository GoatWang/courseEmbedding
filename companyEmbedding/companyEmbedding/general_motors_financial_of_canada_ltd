History[edit]
McLaughlin and Buick[edit]
McLaughlin Motor Car Company was founded in 1907. Samuel McLaughlin and William C. Durant, respectively the biggest carriage builders in Canada and the United States, contracted for Durant's Buick to supply McLaughlin with power trains for 15 years. McLaughlin fitted the power trains to running gear, bodies and chassis built by McLaughlin in Canada. The cars were branded McLaughlin until the end of the contract. McLaughlin-Buick was the brand between 1923 and 1942.
In 1908 Durant and McLaughlin started General Motors Holding Company after Durant exchanged $500,000 of Buick stock for $500,000 of McLaughlin Motor Co. stock. McLaughlin also exchanged his Buick stock for General Motors stock, and in 1910 was invited to be on the board of General Motors in Detroit.
Chevrolet[edit]
In 1915 McLaughlin acquired the Chevrolet Car Company of Canada, which built Chevrolets in Oshawa with Chevrolet motors and McLaughlin bodies. In 1918 he merged his company with it under the name General Motors of Canada Limited prior to his becoming director and vice president of General Motors on the approval of Durant, who was then president of General Motors and owner of the Chevrolet Motor Co. The Corporation moved people in 1918 after McLaughlin allied his Company with the Corporation unknown to Robert McLaughlin,McLaughlin-Buick:"Canada's Standard Car" virtualmuseum.ca . The McLaughlins were given GM Stocks for the Propriortorship of the Canadian Company and $10,000,000 to build Walkerville and Canadian Products. as September 23, 1933 Financial Post page 9 reported but not ownership.[3]

GM Canada is a private subsidiary that is wholly allied noted by The Canadian Motor, Tractor and Implement Journal 1919 by General Motors, so information such as assets, revenues, and profits are not disclosed. Nonetheless, GM Canada has historically been one of the largest and most powerful corporations in Canada, being listed as the third "largest" in 1975, and being comparable to several publicly traded companies such as BCE, George Weston Limited, and Royal Bank of Canada.[4]
General Motors of Canada opened its new head office building on the shore of Lake Ontario in 1989. It is a fixture on Highway 401 and usually displays an enormous picture of a new vehicle on its huge glass atrium. This is a rented structure of General Motors Corporation and today is called General Motors. General Motors of Canada built their first offices on Richmond street in Oshawa and had large General Motors of Canada signage from 1919. The McLaughlin plants were there and were resigned by the McLaughlin Family.
GM's Canadian Regional Engineering Centre opened in June 2001. It is primarily responsible for managing the design and validation of vehicles which are manufactured in Canada, though it supports many joint development efforts with GM operations in other countries.
The manufacturing plants located in Oshawa produced the Chevrolet from 1915, and today the Camaro and included the Chevrolet Truck Company of Canada 1919. Cadillac and LaSalle were built here too. The Oshawa plants have regularly garnered top quality ratings by J.D. Power.[5] The Oshawa facility was ranked number 1 facility in overall quality in North and South America by J.D. Power and Associates.[citation needed] The Truck Plant was closed to give industry to Mexico,and reopen old Saturn Plants.
General Motors of Canada announced a naming rights deal for the General Motors Centre in Oshawa on October 5, 2006. The centre's main tenants are the Oshawa Generals junior hockey team, who were named for the company in 1937.
On April 27, 2009, GM Canada announced that it would cut over half of its Canadian jobs and close 40% of its Canadian dealerships by 2014 in response to its parent company's dire financial straits.[6] Reducing its franchises in Canada from approximately 709 dealerships to +\- 470 across the country, after General Motors (US) bankruptcy. The Canadian Government sold its 12% of General Motors stock, purchased in 2009, in early 2015.
2008 Canadian Auto Workers bargaining[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


General Motors and the Canadian Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining contract on May 15, 2008, a full four months before the existing contract was due to expire. As part of the agreement, GM pledged to maintain production at the Oshawa, Ontario pickup truck plant and made other production commitments.
On June 3, 2008, less than three weeks after ratification of the new contract, GM announced that, due to soaring gasoline prices and plummeting truck sales, it would close four additional truck and SUV plants, including the Oshawa pickup plant.[7]
In response, the CAW organized a blockade of the GM of Canada headquarters in Oshawa. The blockade was ended by an Ontario Superior Court order, after 12 days. Further discussions between GM and the CAW resulted in an agreement to compensate workers at the truck plant and additional product commitments for the Oshawa car assembly plant.[8]

History[edit]
McLaughlin and Buick[edit]
McLaughlin Motor Car Company was founded in 1907. Samuel McLaughlin and William C. Durant, respectively the biggest carriage builders in Canada and the United States, contracted for Durant's Buick to supply McLaughlin with power trains for 15 years. McLaughlin fitted the power trains to running gear, bodies and chassis built by McLaughlin in Canada. The cars were branded McLaughlin until the end of the contract. McLaughlin-Buick was the brand between 1923 and 1942.
In 1908 Durant and McLaughlin started General Motors Holding Company after Durant exchanged $500,000 of Buick stock for $500,000 of McLaughlin Motor Co. stock. McLaughlin also exchanged his Buick stock for General Motors stock, and in 1910 was invited to be on the board of General Motors in Detroit.
Chevrolet[edit]
In 1915 McLaughlin acquired the Chevrolet Car Company of Canada, which built Chevrolets in Oshawa with Chevrolet motors and McLaughlin bodies. In 1918 he merged his company with it under the name General Motors of Canada Limited prior to his becoming director and vice president of General Motors on the approval of Durant, who was then president of General Motors and owner of the Chevrolet Motor Co. The Corporation moved people in 1918 after McLaughlin allied his Company with the Corporation unknown to Robert McLaughlin,McLaughlin-Buick:"Canada's Standard Car" virtualmuseum.ca . The McLaughlins were given GM Stocks for the Propriortorship of the Canadian Company and $10,000,000 to build Walkerville and Canadian Products. as September 23, 1933 Financial Post page 9 reported but not ownership.[3]

GM Canada is a private subsidiary that is wholly allied noted by The Canadian Motor, Tractor and Implement Journal 1919 by General Motors, so information such as assets, revenues, and profits are not disclosed. Nonetheless, GM Canada has historically been one of the largest and most powerful corporations in Canada, being listed as the third "largest" in 1975, and being comparable to several publicly traded companies such as BCE, George Weston Limited, and Royal Bank of Canada.[4]
General Motors of Canada opened its new head office building on the shore of Lake Ontario in 1989. It is a fixture on Highway 401 and usually displays an enormous picture of a new vehicle on its huge glass atrium. This is a rented structure of General Motors Corporation and today is called General Motors. General Motors of Canada built their first offices on Richmond street in Oshawa and had large General Motors of Canada signage from 1919. The McLaughlin plants were there and were resigned by the McLaughlin Family.
GM's Canadian Regional Engineering Centre opened in June 2001. It is primarily responsible for managing the design and validation of vehicles which are manufactured in Canada, though it supports many joint development efforts with GM operations in other countries.
The manufacturing plants located in Oshawa produced the Chevrolet from 1915, and today the Camaro and included the Chevrolet Truck Company of Canada 1919. Cadillac and LaSalle were built here too. The Oshawa plants have regularly garnered top quality ratings by J.D. Power.[5] The Oshawa facility was ranked number 1 facility in overall quality in North and South America by J.D. Power and Associates.[citation needed] The Truck Plant was closed to give industry to Mexico,and reopen old Saturn Plants.
General Motors of Canada announced a naming rights deal for the General Motors Centre in Oshawa on October 5, 2006. The centre's main tenants are the Oshawa Generals junior hockey team, who were named for the company in 1937.
On April 27, 2009, GM Canada announced that it would cut over half of its Canadian jobs and close 40% of its Canadian dealerships by 2014 in response to its parent company's dire financial straits.[6] Reducing its franchises in Canada from approximately 709 dealerships to +\- 470 across the country, after General Motors (US) bankruptcy. The Canadian Government sold its 12% of General Motors stock, purchased in 2009, in early 2015.
2008 Canadian Auto Workers bargaining[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


General Motors and the Canadian Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining contract on May 15, 2008, a full four months before the existing contract was due to expire. As part of the agreement, GM pledged to maintain production at the Oshawa, Ontario pickup truck plant and made other production commitments.
On June 3, 2008, less than three weeks after ratification of the new contract, GM announced that, due to soaring gasoline prices and plummeting truck sales, it would close four additional truck and SUV plants, including the Oshawa pickup plant.[7]
In response, the CAW organized a blockade of the GM of Canada headquarters in Oshawa. The blockade was ended by an Ontario Superior Court order, after 12 days. Further discussions between GM and the CAW resulted in an agreement to compensate workers at the truck plant and additional product commitments for the Oshawa car assembly plant.[8]

History[edit]
McLaughlin and Buick[edit]
McLaughlin Motor Car Company was founded in 1907. Samuel McLaughlin and William C. Durant, respectively the biggest carriage builders in Canada and the United States, contracted for Durant's Buick to supply McLaughlin with power trains for 15 years. McLaughlin fitted the power trains to running gear, bodies and chassis built by McLaughlin in Canada. The cars were branded McLaughlin until the end of the contract. McLaughlin-Buick was the brand between 1923 and 1942.
In 1908 Durant and McLaughlin started General Motors Holding Company after Durant exchanged $500,000 of Buick stock for $500,000 of McLaughlin Motor Co. stock. McLaughlin also exchanged his Buick stock for General Motors stock, and in 1910 was invited to be on the board of General Motors in Detroit.
Chevrolet[edit]
In 1915 McLaughlin acquired the Chevrolet Car Company of Canada, which built Chevrolets in Oshawa with Chevrolet motors and McLaughlin bodies. In 1918 he merged his company with it under the name General Motors of Canada Limited prior to his becoming director and vice president of General Motors on the approval of Durant, who was then president of General Motors and owner of the Chevrolet Motor Co. The Corporation moved people in 1918 after McLaughlin allied his Company with the Corporation unknown to Robert McLaughlin,McLaughlin-Buick:"Canada's Standard Car" virtualmuseum.ca . The McLaughlins were given GM Stocks for the Propriortorship of the Canadian Company and $10,000,000 to build Walkerville and Canadian Products. as September 23, 1933 Financial Post page 9 reported but not ownership.[3]

GM Canada is a private subsidiary that is wholly allied noted by The Canadian Motor, Tractor and Implement Journal 1919 by General Motors, so information such as assets, revenues, and profits are not disclosed. Nonetheless, GM Canada has historically been one of the largest and most powerful corporations in Canada, being listed as the third "largest" in 1975, and being comparable to several publicly traded companies such as BCE, George Weston Limited, and Royal Bank of Canada.[4]
General Motors of Canada opened its new head office building on the shore of Lake Ontario in 1989. It is a fixture on Highway 401 and usually displays an enormous picture of a new vehicle on its huge glass atrium. This is a rented structure of General Motors Corporation and today is called General Motors. General Motors of Canada built their first offices on Richmond street in Oshawa and had large General Motors of Canada signage from 1919. The McLaughlin plants were there and were resigned by the McLaughlin Family.
GM's Canadian Regional Engineering Centre opened in June 2001. It is primarily responsible for managing the design and validation of vehicles which are manufactured in Canada, though it supports many joint development efforts with GM operations in other countries.
The manufacturing plants located in Oshawa produced the Chevrolet from 1915, and today the Camaro and included the Chevrolet Truck Company of Canada 1919. Cadillac and LaSalle were built here too. The Oshawa plants have regularly garnered top quality ratings by J.D. Power.[5] The Oshawa facility was ranked number 1 facility in overall quality in North and South America by J.D. Power and Associates.[citation needed] The Truck Plant was closed to give industry to Mexico,and reopen old Saturn Plants.
General Motors of Canada announced a naming rights deal for the General Motors Centre in Oshawa on October 5, 2006. The centre's main tenants are the Oshawa Generals junior hockey team, who were named for the company in 1937.
On April 27, 2009, GM Canada announced that it would cut over half of its Canadian jobs and close 40% of its Canadian dealerships by 2014 in response to its parent company's dire financial straits.[6] Reducing its franchises in Canada from approximately 709 dealerships to +\- 470 across the country, after General Motors (US) bankruptcy. The Canadian Government sold its 12% of General Motors stock, purchased in 2009, in early 2015.
2008 Canadian Auto Workers bargaining[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


General Motors and the Canadian Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining contract on May 15, 2008, a full four months before the existing contract was due to expire. As part of the agreement, GM pledged to maintain production at the Oshawa, Ontario pickup truck plant and made other production commitments.
On June 3, 2008, less than three weeks after ratification of the new contract, GM announced that, due to soaring gasoline prices and plummeting truck sales, it would close four additional truck and SUV plants, including the Oshawa pickup plant.[7]
In response, the CAW organized a blockade of the GM of Canada headquarters in Oshawa. The blockade was ended by an Ontario Superior Court order, after 12 days. Further discussions between GM and the CAW resulted in an agreement to compensate workers at the truck plant and additional product commitments for the Oshawa car assembly plant.[8]

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

    your past and present employers and creditors, your spouse, insurers, and other third parties with information
    relevant to the purposes described below.

    information or to advise you of special offers or customer programs that we may offer and that you 
    may qualify for. In order to do so, GM Financial may use your Personal Information to determine if 
    you qualify for such offers or customer programs and to contact you using the contact details you 
    have provided.
WHO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES
We may disclose your Personal Information as necessary to provide financial products and services 
    to you, including to:

Credit bureaus, credit reporting agencies and to your current or future creditors for the 
        	purpose of maintaining your credit history and providing credit references;

        	or required by law.

Personal Information may also be disclosed to the automotive manufacturer of the vehicle forming 
    the subject matter of the financing or lease agreement ("Manufacturer") and 
    Manufacturer's authorized dealers, in order that they may meet safety, security, legal and regulatory 
    requirements, including with respect to potential recalls; maintain accurate records to respond to inquiries, 
    provide warranty or other customer service communications and otherwise better understand and manage 
    their relationship with you; and to satisfy other reasonable, legitimate business interests. Unless 
    you opt-out, Manufacturers and their authorized dealers may also use your Personal Information 
    (including financial information) to provide you with general marketing, product, service and 
    business partner information and offers, including end of lease offers and re-marketing of these

Personal Information may be disclosed to our affiliates (including outside of Canada) for internal 
    audit, management, billing or administrative purposes, including defending and bringing legal actions.

    information at any time by giving us reasonable notice. However, you may not be permitted to withdraw
