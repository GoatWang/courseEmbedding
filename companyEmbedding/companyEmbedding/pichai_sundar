On his first visit to Nigeria, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, came bearing gifts.
Pichai attended a Google For Nigeria event in Lagos yesterday (July 27) as the company launched a range of new products, including YouTube Go, an “offline first” version of the video sharing platform for users with slow internet connections. YouTube Go will allow users preview and download videos, rather than stream, and essentially save on data costs.
Nigerian video content, led by the burgeoning Nollywood film industry and ‘Afrobeats’ pop stars, is extremely popular, but with slow and expensive internet access, some Nigerians limit their online viewing to the workplace where connections might be better according to executives at online video companies like IrokoTV.
It’s certainly not lacking in potential. Even though Nigeria’s internet subscriber base has shrunk over the past year due to a regulatory clampdown on unregistered sim cards, the country still has over 91 million mobile internet users, according to regulators. However, that vast user base is largely undermined by unreliable connections across the country. Nigeria has some of the slowest internet speeds of the major economies in Africa. Google is betting on its new data-friendly version of YouTube to help local users navigate that problem. Nigeria will become the second country where the app been launched after a beta launch later this year. YouTube Go was first launched in India in April.

For the last few years there has been plenty of hype about the possible impact of internet access throughout Africa, particularly as mobile phone usage, and then smartphone use, grew rapidly. But it is only in the last two years that the world’s biggest tech leaders have visited to see the potential for themselves. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella launched Windows 10 in Nairobi in July 2015, while Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg had high profile visits to Lagos and Nairobi last year. Last week, Alibaba CEO Jack Ma touched down in Nairobi and Kigali.
Local startup founders and investors will hope these high profile visits will help drive interest in their tech ecosystems beyond being seen as experimental or just for social impact enterprises.

Google is also deepening its product offering in Nigeria including improving its Maps service which has seen Nigerian user numbers double in the past year. As an added feature for Maps, Google announced the launch of its Street View product in Lagos which allows users to virtually view “10,000 kilometers of imagery” across the city.
Pichai said his company is also trying to plug the crucial funding and skills gap on the continent. Google has committed $20 million in grants to “high impact non-profits” in Africa over the next few years. Google will also provide $3 million in equity-free funding to African entrepreneurs and open its first Google Launchpad Space outside the United States in Lagos this year.
In addition, Pichai said, Google will train over 100,000 software developers across the continent, with an initial focus on Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. The training sessions will also be offered in local languages including Swahili, Hausa and Zulu and 40% of trainees will be women.

Early life and education
Pichai was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India,[2] to Lakshmi and Ragunatha Pichai.[12][13][14] Sundar grew up in a two-room apartment on 46th Street, 7th Avenue, in Ashok Nagar, Chennai.[15]
Sundar completed schooling in Jawahar Vidyalaya, a Central Board of Secondary Education school in Ashok Nagar, Chennai and completed the Class XII from Vana Vani school in the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.[16][17] Pichai earned his degree from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in Metallurgical Engineering.[18] He holds an M.S. from Stanford University in Material Sciences and Engineering, and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,[19] where he was named a Siebel Scholar[20][21] and a Palmer Scholar, respectively.
Career




Pichai speaking at the 2015 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain


Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey & Company.[22]
Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome[23] and Chrome OS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development of different applications such as Gmail and Google Maps.[24][25] On 19 November 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of Chrome OS and the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 2011, and released to the public in 2012.[26] On 20 May 2010, he announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google, and introduced the new video format, WebM.[27]
On 13 March 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversees. Android was formerly managed by Andy Rubin.[28] He was a director of Jive Software from April 2011 to 30 July 2013.[29][30][31] Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on 10 August 2015[10] after previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page. On 24 October 2015 he stepped into the new position at the completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company family.[11][31][32]
Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO in 2014, a position that was eventually given to Satya Nadella.[33][34]
Personal life
Pichai is married to Anjali Pichai, and has two children,[8] and lives in Los Altos Hills, in a home designed by Robert Swatt of Swatt Miers.[35][36] Pichai's interests include soccer and cricket. He is an avid fan of FC Barcelona, and he states that "he watches every game of the club."[37]

Google CEO Sundar Pichai is joining parent company Alphabet's board, according to an announcement Monday from the company. 
“Sundar has been doing a great job as Google’s CEO, driving strong growth, partnerships, and tremendous product innovation. I really enjoy working with him and I’m excited that he is joining the Alphabet board,” said Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet, in a statement.
Pichai has been running the Google division since August 2015, when the company decided to separate its different businesses and name the parent company Alphabet. Pichai oversees most of Google's name-bearing properties, including search, cloud and maps. His purview also includes Android and YouTube.
Pichai has been at the company since 2004, with previous roles overseeing Google consumer products, engineering and research efforts.
In addition to Page and Pichai,  some of the other Alphabet board members include co-founder Sergey Brin, former CEO Eric Schmidt, Kleiner Perkins' John Doerr and Google SVP Diane Greene.
The company plans to announce its quarterly earnings after the close of the stock market today.

Early life and education
Pichai was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India,[2] to Lakshmi and Ragunatha Pichai.[12][13][14] Sundar grew up in a two-room apartment on 46th Street, 7th Avenue, in Ashok Nagar, Chennai.[15]
Sundar completed schooling in Jawahar Vidyalaya, a Central Board of Secondary Education school in Ashok Nagar, Chennai and completed the Class XII from Vana Vani school in the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.[16][17] Pichai earned his degree from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in Metallurgical Engineering.[18] He holds an M.S. from Stanford University in Material Sciences and Engineering, and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,[19] where he was named a Siebel Scholar[20][21] and a Palmer Scholar, respectively.
Career




Pichai speaking at the 2015 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain


Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey & Company.[22]
Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome[23] and Chrome OS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development of different applications such as Gmail and Google Maps.[24][25] On 19 November 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of Chrome OS and the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 2011, and released to the public in 2012.[26] On 20 May 2010, he announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google, and introduced the new video format, WebM.[27]
On 13 March 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversees. Android was formerly managed by Andy Rubin.[28] He was a director of Jive Software from April 2011 to 30 July 2013.[29][30][31] Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on 10 August 2015[10] after previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page. On 24 October 2015 he stepped into the new position at the completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company family.[11][31][32]
Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO in 2014, a position that was eventually given to Satya Nadella.[33][34]
Personal life
Pichai is married to Anjali Pichai, and has two children,[8] and lives in Los Altos Hills, in a home designed by Robert Swatt of Swatt Miers.[35][36] Pichai's interests include soccer and cricket. He is an avid fan of FC Barcelona, and he states that "he watches every game of the club."[37]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

        Google CEO made nearly $200 million last year 

        by Seth Fiegerman   @sfiegerman   April 28, 2017: 6:07 PM ET                       Sundar Pichai in 80 Seconds     
Apparently the C in Alphabet stands for crazy cash.  Google CEO Sundar Pichai received nearly $199.7 million in compensation last year, double the amount he made in 2015, according to a filing Friday from Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30).     Pichai's base pay was a mere $650,000. On top of that, he received a stock award for $198.7 million. The company's compensation committee attributed the lavish pay to Pichai's promotion to CEO and "numerous successful product launches."   Pichai, a longtime Google executive, took over as CEO as part of a corporate restructuring in 2015. Larry Page, Google's cofounder and previous CEO, shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella.   Related: Google cofounder's 'flying car' makes its debut    Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing.   In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice controlled smart speaker similar to the Amazon Echo.   These efforts have started to pay off for the company.   Google's "other revenues," a category that includes hardware and cloud services, hit nearly $3.1 billion in the most recent quarter, a gain of about 50% from the same quarter a year earlier.   Alphabet's stock has soared this year, pushing it above a $600 billion market cap this week for the first time.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai to Join Alphabet's Board









Giovanni Bruno




Jul 24, 2017 4:46 PM EDT













 












































































 Google CEO Sundar Pichai will join its parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) board of directors, becoming the 13th board member, the company announced on Monday.   Pichai's appointment grants Google, responsible for 90% of Alphabet's revenue, a second vote on the board. The only other Google executive with a seat on the board is Diane Greene, head of Google's cloud division. Separately, after the market close on Monday, Alphabet reported adjusted second-quarter earnings of $5.01 per share on revenue of $26.01 billion versus analyst expectations of $4.46 per share on revenue of $25.6 billion.  TheStreet is hosting a live blog analyzing Alphabet's earnings report and conference call. Pichai assumed the role of CEO at Google in 2015 when the company reorganized as Alphabet. He joined Alphabet, formerly known as Google Inc., in 2004 as vice president of product management, according to BoardEx, a relationship mapping service of TheStreet Inc. In April 2011, Pichai was named senior vice president of products.    "Sundar has been doing a great job as Google's CEO, driving strong growth, partnerships, and tremendous product innovation," Alphabet CEO Larry Page said in a statement. "I really enjoy working with him and I'm excited that he is joining the Alphabet board."   In addition to joining Page, Pichai will serve along side three other executive directors, including founder Sergey Brin, Chairman Eric Schmidt and Google Senior Vice President Diane Greene.    Alphabet  is a  holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

Sundar completed schooling in Jawahar Vidyalaya, a Central Board of Secondary Education school in Ashok Nagar, Chennai and completed the Class XII from Vana Vani school in the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.[16][17] Pichai earned his degree from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in Metallurgical Engineering.[18] He holds an M.S. from Stanford University in Material Sciences and Engineering, and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,[19] where he was named a Siebel Scholar[20][21] and a Palmer Scholar, respectively.
Career

Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey & Company.[22]
Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome[23] and Chrome OS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development of different applications such as Gmail and Google Maps.[24][25] On 19 November 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of Chrome OS and the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 2011, and released to the public in 2012.[26] On 20 May 2010, he announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google, and introduced the new video format, WebM.[27]

by Dieter Bohn  on May 29, 2015 at 12:15 p.m.
If you use any Google product, chances are Google’s SVP Sundar Pichai has had some say in how it was created. Pichai joined Google in 2004, and over the course of just a few years, Pichai has extended his domain beyond Chrome to encompass Google Drive, Maps, apps, Chrome OS, Android, Search, Ads, ATAP, and more. Pichai’s expansive role was formalized back in October of 2014, when CEO Larry Page handed him the day-to-day responsibilities of running the tech giant.









We sat down with Pichai to hear his vision for the Google of the future. He laid out a plan to improve Google’s products through machine learning — but more importantly, he sketched out a grand effort to deliver computing capabilities to billions of people around the world. Both in the way he manages his internal teams, and in his belief that technology can change people’s lives for the better, Pichai advocates an egalitarian ethos.
After Page and co-founder Sergey Brin, Pichai is almost certainly the most powerful person at Google. Executives in Pichai's position tend to lead their teams with vision, charisma, bombast, or (usually) some combination of all three. But there's no bombast to Pichai. His office is clean to the point of being spartan, and that simplicity is reflected in his demeanor. Pichai is thoughtful and friendly in person, nodding carefully as he listens and then responding with real empathy. After the first day of I/O, I watched as Pichai walked into the hungry press gaggle, giving everybody who approached him equal attention. Amidst the tumult, he even sought me out to finish a conversation we’d had the previous week.
Pichai is clearly proud of the fact that Google's products work the same whether you're a billionaire or a rural farmer
Outside the media scrum, Pichai is slightly more relaxed, slightly more willing to dive into technical detail. When we briefly discuss the new Internet of Things communication standard that was announced this week, he immediately grasps my (low) level of technical understanding and comes right down to it gracefully and without a hint of condescension.
Pichai’s approach toward other people is reflected in his attitude toward what technology itself should do. With his larger role, that attitude is rapidly infusing Google’s new products. Now on Tap, organized photos, virtual reality videos stitched together in the cloud, and even Project Ara's first foray into the consumer market in Puerto Rico are all happening in large part thanks to Pichai's goal of making Google's technology available to as many people as possible. Under Pichai, both Google's product vision and its out-there R&D projects all seem to be heading in the same direction much more than before.
So when Pichai talks about the next billion people about to come online with smartphones, I get the impression that, for him, Google’s monetization strategy really is secondary to Pichai's stated goal: giving people everywhere the power of Google's machine learning whenever and wherever they need it. He's clearly proud of the fact that Google's products work the same whether you're a billionaire or a rural farmer in a far-flung place. And Pichai's vision is to ensure that dedication becomes a part of everything Google makes.
Coming from a different company, the claims Pichai and his product managers make would sound like clichés: a supercomputer in your pocket, a new way to systematize innovation, empowering the next billion. But if anyone in Silicon Valley has the power to transform moonshot fantasies into powerful realities, it’s Google — Sundar’s Google.



 
This interview has been edited for clarity and length 
Dieter Bohn: This is the first I/O where you were officially in charge of everything being presented. Did that change your approach?

Sundar Pichai: It’s a good question. Historically we’ve used I/O as an opportunity to take a step back and help people get a sense across what Google is doing...and tended to focus more on our platforms. We’ll continue to do that this year, but maybe it’s a bit easier to do it end to end.
I think it’s been a while [since] we stepped back and told the story, not just from a platform perspective but also from a Google standpoint — what we hope to accomplish, and also focus on developers.
"How do you identify problems, solve [them] at scale, and bring technology to bear?" 
Back in October there was a little bit of reorganization, and you were able to take charge of more, or most, of Google’s core products. Are there specific priorities you’re better equipped to drive now?

In some ways, yes. We have these large services which users use and they work at scale. We have ongoing platforms we’re evolving. But if you want to think ahead and plan for the next two to three years as to where online computing platforms are evolving and how do you drive the experience on top of it, being able to think holistically, road map it out, and think it through — I do think that’s been unique.
For example, we’ve been thinking hard about how we help organize users' information on mobile. It’s core to our mission of what we set out to do. [With] those kinds of things, it helps us to step back, think about it, and do it better.

How are you able to do it better now?

At a high level I think of what we are doing in terms of two core things.  One is what we set out and wrote in the Founders’ Letter, which is to say we really want to work on big problems that help solve big problems in users’ lives. We want to do it at scale, we want to do it for everyone. If you look at search, it worked that way. Maps, YouTube, Chrome, Android [all did too]. So, we want to continue doing that. How do you identify problems, solve [them] at scale and bring technology to bear?
The second is our core mission statement, which is to organize users’ information. We’ve seen this with things like Google Now, where we try hard to tell you, "Okay, maybe you want to leave earlier to go to a particular meeting" or when you land and reach an airport line we say, "Here’s your boarding pass." When we think about organizing the world’s information in the context of mobile, people are trying to get stuff done. So we need to go a step further and be assistive where we can.
"We have taken things like error in word recognition down from about 23 percent to 8 percent."
Underlying all of that is we’ve invested a lot in machine learning. Today, if you open a phone and you say, "Hey, what does a tree frog look like?," we are understanding voice, going through all images and trying to understand how a tree frog is different from other types of frogs, salamanders, et cetera. Sometimes [that information] needs to be translated. All these are huge advances in computer science, and are primarily driven by machine learning. Just in the last three years, we have taken things like error in word recognition down from about 23 percent to 8 percent. And it’s because of what we call deep neural nets. We [have] made great strides.
[But] how do you use all this technology and [these] advances to be more assistive to users? So, you will see us talk about how we can take Google Now and make it work better in the context of your phone. If you’re looking for information in the context of using applications, how can we do that? To me, doing things like that are core to what Google promised users it will do, so that’s the second big part of what we do.






I’ve been talking to a bunch of people in Google over the past couple of weeks, and a phrase I’m hearing over and over again is "the next billion." There’s a billion people using Android — how do we get the next billion? Is there a coherent strategy behind that goal?

The entire PC industry reached about 1.7 billion people. [But with mobile,] we are truly dealing with the first computing platform [that] is going to touch people at scale. I can see a clear path to getting over 5 billion users one day. I think just in the last 12 months there [have been] over 600 million users who for the first time have had access to a modern computing platform. A smartphone, effectively. So we deeply care about it.
At our core, we want to build products for everyone. At a basic level, at a foundational level, [that means] both providing computing and making it accessible, which is why we are interested in Android One [and] affordable Chromebooks. And thinking about connectivity over time, [that] is why we are doing things like Project Loon.
"Net neutrality has served us well, so we are pretty committed to it."
The second is from our services standpoint: we realize for those users, the experience needs to evolve. So we are thoughtfully, across our products, thinking about what it means for a user in India or Brazil or Indonesia or Africa with limited connectivity to use products like YouTube, Google Search, Google Maps. How do we make their experience better? That’s a big part of it.

I’m sure you’ve seen there’s been a bunch of debate about Internet.org and net neutrality. Does Google, or do you personally, have a stance on whether it’s important to try and have some net neutrality standard in emerging markets?

Net neutrality has served us well, so we are pretty committed to it. I’m not fully familiar with all the issues around Internet.org, but … it’s pretty obvious to me that users in these markets want the same as users in the developed world. They want data to be plentiful and affordable, right?
I think we have a model which works well. Which is why I am a big fan of more foundational efforts. A lot of carrier partners are investing [in] a lot of efforts. To me, this is not a physics problem … We know how to provide connectivity at scale, so how we get that done in developing markets has got to be the test of the effort.

You get asked this question frequently,  but I’m going to ask you again: Android seems like it’s getting more and more popular in China, but Google services aren’t. Is your philosophy still "we hope to get there but we’re going to wait and see"?

We are going to continue providing Android to the fullest extent possible in China, so we are incredibly excited. The market [there] is a substantial market; it’s unique. So we deeply care about investing there. We would love to serve Chinese users with Google services as well, obviously. I think it will be a privilege to do that, but we need to be thoughtful in how we do it. We are open to newer approaches. We’ll have to wait and see.
  
In addition to providing information and its core products, Google also does a bunch of really crazy shit: Project Loon, Calico — all these moonshots, large and small. A lot of this stuff is really interesting, but it’s hard to see a path for it to be anything more than cool experiments. Should these divisions keep doing crazy stuff or should they be pushed to become productized, core parts of Google?

I would draw a distinction between things like research and ATAP, which are research efforts with different flavors of how we approach research, versus areas like our core products, self-driving cars, or Project Loon or even our Iris contact lens.   Can we apply technology and bring a differentiated and a unique way of solving a problem? Does it apply to millions or billions of people? Those efforts are done under that framework, and while the effort may seem ambitious or crazy, we take a very disciplined approach.
Those [projects] are thought through like businesses. It’s just that we are willing to take a long-term view. But we run them in a very disciplined way. We have a good notion of, "Okay, here’s how much investment it will take, here’s how long it will take, what are the use cases and applications, and how will this whole thing play out?"
"Where we see traction, we will double down. Otherwise, we will course-correct."
Where we see traction, we will double down. Otherwise, we will course-correct. We will do both. We need to be thoughtful about these things. We do them because we believe that software is at a stage where [it is] increasingly playing a more and more critical role in solving [problems] it didn’t before.

You’ve just announced Project Fi, and you’re also announcing Android Pay. Both of these feel like departures from the early days of programs like Nexus, when it seemed like there was an attitude of going at it alone. With Pay and Fi, you’re partnering with carriers. Is there a shift in Google's attitude toward working with other companies?

By the way, the same is true for Loon. We are doing it with Vodafone, Telefonica, and Telstra. Our goal is to reach everyone.
Out of [that goal] arises a lot of what we do. Because we have decided we want to solve it for everyone, inherently that forced us to think hard about a partnership approach. That’s what helps us reach everyone with Android. We do work with 400 OEMs, [and] over 550 carriers to make 4,000 distinct devices.
We shipped over a billion Android phones in 2014. When I look at the scale of how it happens, all the way from the low end the high end, that matters to us.
[Search, Chrome, Maps, and YouTube] are all products available for everyone. For something like [Project Loon] to work across the world, you will inevitably end up working with carrier partners. For self-driving cars to have an impact, you will see us take a partnership approach there as well.
"We shipped over a billion Android phones in 2014." 
What do you think of Microsoft’s effort to get Android running on Windows mobile? Are you guys working with them on that? Do you have a dog in that hunt?

My understanding is based on what I read — probably [from the] Verge summary of the Build Conference. Today, there are many efforts underway like that, right? Others have efforts, Amazon does it for their products, so it’s not new to us. It’s a testament to the scale of the app ecosystem on top of Android. A lot of what we do in Android is open source, and things are designed for it to be used easily elsewhere, so it’s good to see all that. 





If I bring up Microsoft, I have to bring up Apple. Apple has entered a slew of new markets: they are rumored to be trying to get on TV, they’re rumored to do music streaming, they just released a watch, they have Apple Pay. They’re directly competing with you in lots of areas: you’ve got a music streaming service, you’ve got a TV product, you’ve had Wallet for a while. What unique advantage does Google have over Apple across all of these different product categories?
 
Look, Apple and [Google], we [get] talked about together, [but] we two are trying to do different things. To users, it arrives as a choice of an iPhone or an Android smartphone.
But [Apple is] thinking through end-to-end. They are vertically integrated, and they think about an end-to-end product. We are trying to build a horizontal platform and enable many people. So it’s a bit tough to compare and contrast, right? Having said that, we do approach things a bit differently. We generally think about whatever we build [as] cross platform, trying to reach everyone. We think deeply about them being cloud services and leveraging the power of the hard work we have done over the years to build several large cloud services which are building users at scale.
"It matters that we drive technology as an enabler for everyone around the world."
Those are the things we tend to go deeper on. It’s good for users that there are companies who are approaching it differently. It gives rise to choice and over time I would say healthy innovation, which pushes all of us further along. Apple is doing really well, [and that] forces us to work harder. Hopefully it’s a virtuous cycle.

Is there anything personally important to you that you wish Google as a whole were doing more of?

The thing that attracted me to Google and to [the] internet in general is that it’s a great equalizer. I’ve always been struck by the fact that Google search worked the same as long as you had access to a computer with connectivity, [whether] you were a rural kid anywhere or a professor at Stanford or Harvard.
I want Google to strive to do that — not just build technology for certain segments. For me, it matters that we drive technology as an equalizing force, as an enabler for everyone around the world.
Which is why I do want Google to see, push, and invest more in making sure computing is more accessible, connectivity is more accessible. And going back to our core mission, when we do things like machine learning and assist users, I view that as a huge game changer. Because over time, someone who has [access to] just a smartphone hopefully has...the same [capabilities] as someone who is more privileged. That’s what’s very exciting about what we are doing.

The incredibly fast rise of Google's Sundar Pichai | Fortune.comTechSearchSearchFordU.S. Expands Probe Into Ford Explorers Over Carbon Monoxide ConcernsWMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: July 28COMPARECARDSSPONSOREDUberUber’s CEO Searchlight Reportedly Hits Former GE Head Jeff ImmeltPhoto courtesy: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg—Getty ImagesGoogleThe incredibly fast rise of Sundar PichaiMiguel HelftOct 27, 2014When Google announced that it had built a Web browser on Labor Day in 2008, the event represented something of a coming out party for Sundar Pichai, a little-known and soft-spoken middle manager at the company. Based on how the launch went, no one would have predicted that six years later, Pichai would be where is today—a clear No. 2 to CEO Larry Page following a management shakeup late last week.Indeed, the launch of the Chrome browser was something of a debacle. Google (goog) had worked hard behind the scenes to orchestrate a media splash. It had readied talking points to explain why it was reigniting a browser war with Microsoft (msft), and why its erstwhile ally, Mozilla, maker of the Firefox browser, shouldn’t worry. As part of it, the company had secretly produced an elaborate, 38-page comic book that explained the unique features of Google’s browser. It was expected to land in the mailboxes of journalists and bloggers on that Tuesday just as they returned from the three-day weekend.But the comic books arrived in Germany on Monday, and it was not a holiday there. After a German blogger posted the comic book online, the Chrome team had to scramble to handle the fiasco. Top executives, including Pichai’s boss at the time, Marissa Mayer, were summoned to the Googleplex. After quick but spirited debate, the team decided to move up the announcement by a day. As engineers scrambled to make Chrome available for download from Google’s network of data centers, public relations staff started to alert reporters—most of whom where on holiday—one by one.Embarrassing as it was, the snafu was quickly forgotten. Chrome, which launched amid skepticism that it could make inroads against the dominant browsers of the time, Internet Explorer and Firefox, became a runaway hit. It is now the No. 1 browser in the world, with a market share that's more than twice that of the once dominant Internet Explorer, according to StatCounter. Its success paved the way for a series of related strategically important products including Chrome OS, Chromebooks, and Chromecast. And it became the engine that powered Pichai through one of the fastest corporate ascents in the technology industry.Inside Google, however, Pichai had already made his mark as a director of product management for an obscure but important weapon in the company’s arsenal: the Google toolbar. The toolbar was critical because it helped Google make its search engine the default option on IE and Firefox. And Pichai’s role in leading the product as it came under attack from Microsoft, helped cement his standing in the company, as detailed in a Fortune story titled The Dawn of the Chrome Age earlier this year:Chrome had another, less public mission: to defend the search engine that accounts for most of Google’s $59.8 billion in 2013 revenues and $12.9 billion in profits. Since 2000, Google had distributed a browser toolbar that made its search engine the default on IE and Firefox. (The toolbar also allowed Google to track users’ surfing habits.)The toolbar — as geeky and benign as it sounds — was a key locus of Google’s combat with Microsoft. Pichai was the group’s leader, and by the mid-aughts he worried that Microsoft would modify IE to make it more difficult, or even impossible, for users to install the toolbar. In a series of sometimes tense conversations with top brass around the time of a major update to IE in October 2006, Pichai argued that Microsoft could threaten a sizable chunk of Google’s business, according to two executives who were there. “It was a doomsday-like scenario,” one of the executives says. Shortly after, Google execs gave Chrome the green light.After the launch of Chrome, Pichai was promoted to vice president and later to senior vice president. He was given oversight for Google’s apps, including Gmail, and became a member of the exclusive L-team, the small group of executives who report directly to Page. And when Android creator Andy Rubin left to begin a secret robotics project within Google, Page put Pichai in charge of Android as well.With his latest promotion, which is meant to allow Page to focus on longer term issues and on pushing products forward without the overhead of having too many direct reports, Pichai will now also oversee products like search, maps, Google+, commerce, ad products and infrastructure. That's the vast majority of Google's enterprise, with the exception of YouTube and other semi-independent units like Nest, Google X, and Calico. Just six years ago, he was one of dozens of mid-level Googlers with the title of director of product management.Pichai, 42, is a native of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. He attended university in India before obtaining a graduate degree in engineering and materials science at Stanford. He earned an MBA at the Wharton School and worked at McKinsey and Applied Materials before joining Google in 2004. He is universally well-liked at Google, where he seems to enjoy a "warm, easygoing rapport" with Page, as well as outside the company. When news of his latest promotion to head all of Google’s products came out last week, venture capitalist Om Malik, a former blogger, tweeted what was in the mind of many: "Proof nice guys can win."Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

On 24 October 2015 he stepped into the new position at the completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company family.

Sundar Pichai








Sundar Pichai
Birth Date: July 12, 1972
Birth Place: Chennai, India
Parents: Lakshmi Pichai and Regunatha Pichai
Arrival in U.S.A.: California, 1993
Naturalization Date:
Homes in U.S.A.:  Los Altos, California
Place of primary residence: Los Altos, California


Material Engineer, Businessman, CEO of Google (1972–)
Coming from a middle class family in India, Sundar Pichai excelled in school and obtained a scholarship to Stanford University, ultimately letting him achieve his own version of the American Dream of becoming CEO of Google in 2015.

Sundar Pichai spent his childhood in Chennai, India, where his father, Regunatha Pichai worked as an electrical engineer for General Electric and where his mother, Lakshmi Pichai, worked as a stenographer before she had children. His father recalled how he used to talk about his work to Sundar, and how it piqued his interest toward technology and engineering. The family of four lived in a two-room apartment, with Sundar and his younger brother sleeping in the living room. During much of his childhood, the Pichais didn’t have a television or a car. For transportation, Sundar’s family would take the blue Lambretta scooter they saved three years to buy.

Pichai excelled at school and won a coveted spot at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, where he studied metallurgical engineering. After graduating, he won an additional scholarship to Stanford University in 1993 to study materials science and semiconductor physics and he lived with a host family during his first year. Pichai planned to get a Ph.D. at Stanford and pursue an academic career, but he dropped out to work as an engineer and product manager at Applied Materials, a Silicon Valley semiconductor maker. After getting an MBA from the Wharton School of Business in 2002 and spending a stint as a consultant at McKinsey & Company, Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts such as Google Chrome.

He proposed that Google build its own browser and won the support of the company’s co-founders, though he faced an objection from then-CEO Eric Schmidt, who thought that it would be too costly. Pichai continued to innovate by assembling a large, well-funded group inside Google to create the Chrome OS and Chromebooks in 2011. He forged strong relationships with retailers such as Best Buy and PC manufacturers such as Dell, Lenovo, and Samsung. In 2013, Pichai was asked to manage the Android OS, helping to further incorporate Google applications with Android based products.

Pichai was announced as the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015 after previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO Larry Page on October 24, 2014. He stepped into the new CEO of Google position on October 2, 2015 at 43 years of age.

Sandar recently initiated a program called Internet Saathi, which employs women to ride bikes out to remote and rural villages with Android phones and tablets, where they then teach other women how to use the devices. Google is planning to engage 300,000 villages across India in this way by the end of 2018. Google has also contributed to offering free Wi-Fi at railway stations all across India.

Sundar Pichai currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife, Anjali Pichai, a chemical engineer and same-year classmate at IIT Kharagpur, and they have two children.
