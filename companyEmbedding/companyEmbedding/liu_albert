Albert Liu
Bio

Albert Liu worked as a marketing executive for more than fifteen years. He pitched spicy men’s aftershave, sexy long distance phone plans, difficult to explain computer software and stingy slot machines, among numerous other boring commodities. Tired of the corporate grind, he sought professional freedom and independence by becoming an investor/trader. It was a career track quickly derailed after several severe misses (Purchasing Groupon and Zynga a half dozen times each as their prices continued to plummet proved that Albert would never become a Warren Buffet).
An atrocious stock-picker and ten months into his 40s, Albert finally got the nerve to pursue a real passion – writing. Abridged is his first novel. He lives with his family in a suburb outside Chicago, where he’s currently at work on his second book.
