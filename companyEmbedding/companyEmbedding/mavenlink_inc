You should too…   Create Free Account    Start your free trial                                                   What you get for 16 cents per user a day We set our pricing in a way that allows us to continue building for you a product of the highest quality and value. At 16 cents a user a day, this sets you back less than a paper clip a person. We want the value you get from dapulse to be very real and very tangible. So we've created dapulse to be the backbone of how your team thinks, interacts and creates. We built our tool from the bottom up, addressing real challenges for real people. The hardest part of introducing any new software to your team is actually getting them to use it. So we worked hard to make sure dapulse comes with built in addiction. Unlike traditional softwares that solely serves the manager, dapulse is a tool that your team actually loves using as it helps them with their work rather than hindering them in it. There's no greater investment than pulling your team together, showing them the way to greatness and igniting them with passion to fight fiercely towards it.​           Manage Faster Together The fastest project management tool   Create Free Account    Start your free trial         @dapulseLabs is a blessing on days like today, when the team is working remotely.

Lliterlly, time management solutions to the max! #timeforteamwork— Truffle Social (@TruffleSocial) April 6, 2016              The gift of management, built in We made dapulse to be way more than just a single place to manage high and low level projects together. We realized there's a pain that runs much deeper than this. A pain that stems from the fact that most managers simply give people tasks. With dapulse you're able to manage the week, and then the month. You plan the week and then harness the whole team to achieve something great together. With the visual synchronization of High and Low level, you get a gift of management - the ability to set priorities and not just give out tasks on a day to day basis. When you manage the week, you can start looking ahead, planning, and achieving greatness together. And this is something that dapulse gives you right off the bat.            You're never alone We're nice people. We like other people. We're not sales people. If you have any questions about setting up dapulse, integrations, pricing or the meaning of life, our customer success team is here for you. Ranked as the best support in the immediate galaxies, we're dedicated 24/7 to making sure dapulse works for you. Whether you're brewing beers in Australia or running a Fortune 500 in America, dapulse will ignite your team with passion to fight fiercely towards greatness. And we'll be here with you for the entire journey. Contact Us                    Avishai Abrahami | CEO & Co-founder at Wix.com   A company's structure is the result of leadership that creates a culture. We wanted a culture of togetherness, of people getting recognition. Today, at Wix parties, I can approach any employee and talk to them about their work. It blows their minds. They're like 'how do you know?' and the answer is dapulse! Do you know what that does to their motivation?                Roee Adler | Head of Digital Products at WeWork   dapulse is the best way I know to manage product management processes, especially those involving lots of creative design. It allows our team to visualise our high-level plan and prioritize it in a collaborative way. dapulse excels in that like no other tool I know (and I know lots of them…)                Brad Wohlgemuth | Art Director at Discovery   dapulse has allowed us to better concentrate on actually creating and executing on projects versus spending time sifting through e-mails and lost communication. It can accommodate a large number of projects and create an easy to use atmosphere where project managers and designers have full access to the entire life cycle of a project.                Hope Horner | Founder & CEO at Lemonlight Media   Today, quite literally, everyone gets in in the morning, and they look at the dapulse to see the top priorities. At any given point, we have roughly 300 clients running through various parts of their production or distribution cycle. Prior to dapulse, I had zero insight where our customers were in their life cycle without digging through emails or other software programs. dapulse gave me a simple way to see exactly where each customer was in their life cycle at any given point.                Bernard-Burton Koomson | CRM Content Manager at Adidas   dapulse is a great tool that really helps the team stay connected, we all use it on a daily basis and would recommend it to anyone who is trying to bridge the gap between working with a large team of project managers.                Pamela Becker | VP Global Marketing at Matomy   It’s not just about managing projects…dapulse is an excellent project collaboration tool. Whether working internally or with outside partners using shareable boards, everyone on the team knows where the project stands in real time, and what needs to be done next and when. Plus, all the supportive documents are inside. Thanks dapulse!                Amit Elisha | VP Product at Outbrain   dapulse lets us make sense out of the cluttered world of an agile organization. It gives us the big picture of everything we’re doing and allows us to connect our small sprints to the greater story of what we’re trying to achieve.                You're never alone We're nice people. We like other people. We're not sales people.

Frequently Asked Questions



Can I try Mavenlink for free?
Yes! Any Mavenlink plan can be tried free for ten days. To test drive our most basic plan, simply create an account to get started. If you’re interested in our Professional or Premier plans, you can get a free trial by scheduling a demo. We’ve found that getting a personalized tour of the product helps you make the most of your trial and is the quickest way to decide whether Mavenlink is right for your organization.




Can I invite clients into my project? What does that cost?
Mavenlink makes it easy to deliver work to your clients. We let you invite an unlimited number of clients into your project workspaces for free. When invited to a project, clients can create their free accounts, which do not count as billable user accounts. Mavenlink is designed so that your client relationships are clearly identified in each Mavenlink project workspace. Your clients cannot access certain features (e.g., time tracking) and internal information (e.g., cost rates).




What happens when my free trial ends?
During your free trial, you will have access to the full functionality of the Mavenlink plan you selected. When the trial ends, Mavenlink preserves your data in case you decide to subscribe. If you need more time to evaluate the software or would like to try a more advanced plan, please request access and we’ll respond to you shortly.




How does Mavenlink handle contractors and freelancers?
Mavenlink is designed with contracted and freelanced work in mind. Any existing user you would like to contract who currently has a paid Mavenlink account can be invited to participate in your projects at no additional cost. When you invite new users to help deliver a project, you can opt to add them into your account and pay for those seats. This lets you manage their account-wide permissions. Alternately, your new user can create his or her own Mavenlink account. This option is preferable if this contractor plans to use Mavenlink for their own projects as well.




Do I have to pay extra for users with different permission levels?
No! To simplify pricing and keep costs predictable, Mavenlink offers consistent pricing across permission levels. You can set the appropriate permissions for every user (at both the account and project level) without worrying about how this affects your total cost.




What is Mavenlink Insights?
Mavenlink Insights is a business intelligence (BI) solution for project delivery teams. Insights helps your project teams answer questions about their business so they can get the results they want. Insights is included for Enterprise plan customers and available to Premier accounts for an additional cost.




Do you offer discounts or special rates for non-profits?
Yes, Mavenlink offers special pricing for charitable organizations with a 501(c)(3) designation. Please complete this form and we will be happy to get back to you with more information.




I have other questions! Who can help me?
If you have any questions about Mavenlink or the sign-up process please send us a note at sales@mavenlink.com. We look forward to hearing from you!

The trial is free, but after that, yeah, you’ll need to subscribe to one of our plans to continue using dapulse. Don’t give us that look ;) We’re committed to building an amazing product that provides real and tangible value to you every day. At 16 cents per user a day, our Basic plan sets you back less than a pencil per person. There’s no greater investment than pulling your team together and finding a great way to get work done, and many of our customers tell us that their experience with dapulse is truly invaluable. Imagine never missing another deadline, totally eliminating angry phone calls from clients, or putting an end to painful email threads—for real. Imagine actually enjoying your everyday life at work. Priceless, no?     How does your pricing work?    We’re a tiered subscription service, and our pricing is based on the number of people on your team as well as the plan that’s best for you. Check out our handy calculator above to get a personalized quote pronto.     Which plan is right for me?    That’s a good question and there are a number of factors to consider.

So we've created dapulse to be the backbone of how your team thinks, interacts and creates. We built our tool from the bottom up, addressing real challenges for real people. The hardest part of introducing any new software to your team is actually getting them to use it. So we worked hard to make sure dapulse comes with built in addiction. Unlike traditional softwares that solely serves the manager, dapulse is a tool that your team actually loves using as it helps them with their work rather than hindering them in it. There's no greater investment than pulling your team together, showing them the way to greatness and igniting them with passion to fight fiercely towards it.​           Manage Faster Together The fastest project management tool   Create Free Account    Start your free trial         @dapulseLabs is a blessing on days like today, when the team is working remotely.

Lliterlly, time management solutions to the max! #timeforteamwork— Truffle Social (@TruffleSocial) April 6, 2016              The gift of management, built in We made dapulse to be way more than just a single place to manage high and low level projects together. We realized there's a pain that runs much deeper than this. A pain that stems from the fact that most managers simply give people tasks. With dapulse you're able to manage the week, and then the month. You plan the week and then harness the whole team to achieve something great together. With the visual synchronization of High and Low level, you get a gift of management - the ability to set priorities and not just give out tasks on a day to day basis. When you manage the week, you can start looking ahead, planning, and achieving greatness together. And this is something that dapulse gives you right off the bat.            You're never alone We're nice people. We like other people. We're not sales people. If you have any questions about setting up dapulse, integrations, pricing or the meaning of life, our customer success team is here for you. Ranked as the best support in the immediate galaxies, we're dedicated 24/7 to making sure dapulse works for you. Whether you're brewing beers in Australia or running a Fortune 500 in America, dapulse will ignite your team with passion to fight fiercely towards greatness. And we'll be here with you for the entire journey. Contact Us                    Avishai Abrahami | CEO & Co-founder at Wix.com   A company's structure is the result of leadership that creates a culture. We wanted a culture of togetherness, of people getting recognition. Today, at Wix parties, I can approach any employee and talk to them about their work. It blows their minds. They're like 'how do you know?' and the answer is dapulse! Do you know what that does to their motivation?                Roee Adler | Head of Digital Products at WeWork   dapulse is the best way I know to manage product management processes, especially those involving lots of creative design. It allows our team to visualise our high-level plan and prioritize it in a collaborative way. dapulse excels in that like no other tool I know (and I know lots of them…)                Brad Wohlgemuth | Art Director at Discovery   dapulse has allowed us to better concentrate on actually creating and executing on projects versus spending time sifting through e-mails and lost communication. It can accommodate a large number of projects and create an easy to use atmosphere where project managers and designers have full access to the entire life cycle of a project.                Hope Horner | Founder & CEO at Lemonlight Media   Today, quite literally, everyone gets in in the morning, and they look at the dapulse to see the top priorities. At any given point, we have roughly 300 clients running through various parts of their production or distribution cycle. Prior to dapulse, I had zero insight where our customers were in their life cycle without digging through emails or other software programs. dapulse gave me a simple way to see exactly where each customer was in their life cycle at any given point.                Bernard-Burton Koomson | CRM Content Manager at Adidas   dapulse is a great tool that really helps the team stay connected, we all use it on a daily basis and would recommend it to anyone who is trying to bridge the gap between working with a large team of project managers.                Pamela Becker | VP Global Marketing at Matomy   It’s not just about managing projects…dapulse is an excellent project collaboration tool. Whether working internally or with outside partners using shareable boards, everyone on the team knows where the project stands in real time, and what needs to be done next and when. Plus, all the supportive documents are inside. Thanks dapulse!                Amit Elisha | VP Product at Outbrain   dapulse lets us make sense out of the cluttered world of an agile organization. It gives us the big picture of everything we’re doing and allows us to connect our small sprints to the greater story of what we’re trying to achieve.

History[edit]
Mavenlink was founded in 2008 by Ray Grainger, Roger Neel and Sean Crafts,[2] who had previously worked at InQuira together. With the growth of cloud computing, the three saw an opportunity for small and medium-sized businesses to leverage enterprise software applications for managing projects and conducting business online, and to access a wide network of consultants and service providers.[3]
The name Mavenlink was partially inspired by the concept of “Mavens,” an information specialist personality type described in The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell.[4]
In April 2009, the first Mavenlink software platform was released in beta and in January 2010 is was made generally available to the public.[3]
In June 2010, Mavenlink was integrated with Google Apps,[5] and in January 2011, the software was integrated with Intuit's Quickbooks software.[6][7][8]
By February 2011, the company reported approximately 200,000 subscribers to the Mavenlink software.[9]
In July 2017, the company opened its first European office in London, and reported 2,000 customers in 100 countries.[1]

History[edit]
Mavenlink was founded in 2008 by Ray Grainger, Roger Neel and Sean Crafts,[2] who had previously worked at InQuira together. With the growth of cloud computing, the three saw an opportunity for small and medium-sized businesses to leverage enterprise software applications for managing projects and conducting business online, and to access a wide network of consultants and service providers.[3]
The name Mavenlink was partially inspired by the concept of “Mavens,” an information specialist personality type described in The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell.[4]
In April 2009, the first Mavenlink software platform was released in beta and in January 2010 is was made generally available to the public.[3]
In June 2010, Mavenlink was integrated with Google Apps,[5] and in January 2011, the software was integrated with Intuit's Quickbooks software.[6][7][8]
By February 2011, the company reported approximately 200,000 subscribers to the Mavenlink software.[9]
In July 2017, the company opened its first European office in London, and reported 2,000 customers in 100 countries.[1]

History[edit]
Mavenlink was founded in 2008 by Ray Grainger, Roger Neel and Sean Crafts,[2] who had previously worked at InQuira together. With the growth of cloud computing, the three saw an opportunity for small and medium-sized businesses to leverage enterprise software applications for managing projects and conducting business online, and to access a wide network of consultants and service providers.[3]
The name Mavenlink was partially inspired by the concept of “Mavens,” an information specialist personality type described in The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell.[4]
In April 2009, the first Mavenlink software platform was released in beta and in January 2010 is was made generally available to the public.[3]
In June 2010, Mavenlink was integrated with Google Apps,[5] and in January 2011, the software was integrated with Intuit's Quickbooks software.[6][7][8]
By February 2011, the company reported approximately 200,000 subscribers to the Mavenlink software.[9]
In July 2017, the company opened its first European office in London, and reported 2,000 customers in 100 countries.[1]
Funding history[edit]
In February 2009, Mavenlink secured $1 million in investment capital during its Angel round of funding, which was led by current and former Accenture partners. In November 2011, Mavenlink secured $3.9 million from Quest Software, Inc. and Madden Capital Partners, LLC., and in January 2012, the company received an additional $3 million from Quest Software, Inc. and Madden Capital Partners, LLC.[9][10][11] In December 2013, Mavenlink received an institutional investment from Carrick Capital Partners in the amount of $7 million.[12][13][14] In February 2015, the company announced a $19 million funding round led by San Francisco-based Carrick Capital Partners LP and Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara.[15] In November 2016, the company announced a Series D funding round of $39 million from Goldman Sachs.[16]
Offices[edit]
The company has offices in Irvine, California; San Francisco, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; Boston, Massachusetts[citation needed] and London, England.[1]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
