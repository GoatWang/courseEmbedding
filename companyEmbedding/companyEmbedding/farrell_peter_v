About Farrell


Background & Inspiration

The Farrell brand is jointly owned by Robbie Williams and Peter Jones CBE.
The Farrell range was created in tribute to Jack Farrell, aka Jack the Giant Killer. Jack was a notable dresser, a Stoke-on-Trent native, who lived a hard life but lived it well. A strong man, Jack believed in honesty, integrity, good manners and a sense of honour.
He wanted his values to live on, for the generations that followed him to rise to the occasion and be men, Jack was a mentor figure, teaching his four-year-old grandson, Robbie Williams, how to punch, taking him for walks in the park, encouraging him to jump on the bed to strengthen his legs – showing him how to be a man. Jack taught responsibility and free will, to go out and chase down every opportunity, and to command respect.
The Farrell range was created in tribute to Jack’s legacy, and to make quality clothing for the everyman. In keeping with our goal of creating clothing for the everyman the Farrell range is available exclusively at key Primark stores, the retailer widely established as the destination store for keeping up with the latest looks without breaking the bank.
The Farrell logo is the three-looped Stafford Knot. At once a reference to the North and to Staffordshire (Jack Farrell’s stomping ground), the Stafford Knot is a symbol of unity - as expressed by its motto ‘the knot unites’. For the Farrell brand, it stands for friendship and respect for your mates: the bro’ code.
All for one and one for all, suggests the Stafford Knot: swordsmen, out on the town, and out for a laugh.

Robbie Williams


Robbie Williams has sold over 70 million albums over his solo career and has won more BRIT Awards than any other artist in history.  Robbie’s 2010 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution To Music brought his tally of Brits to an astonishing 17.
Six of Robbie’s albums appear in the all time top 100 biggest selling albums in the UK whilst Williams holds the record for the most concert tickets sold in one day – 1.6 million in 2006.  These accolades coupled with the honour of playing the largest open air concert in UK history to 375,000 people (an unprecedented three nights at Knebworth in 2003) have meant that Robbie’s status as a live performer has equalled his massive achievements as a recording artist.
The release of Robbie’s most recent album, ‘Swings Both Ways’ saw him achieve a UK chart-topping tally to match Elvis Presley, boasting 11 Official Albums Chart solo Number Ones apiece.
March 2015 will see Robbie Williams embark on his brand new “Let Me Entertain You Tour”. Opening in Madrid on March 25 and culminating in Israel on May 2, Robbie will be visiting several cities he has never played before.
Farrell is a brand that is close to his heart.

Peter Jones CBE


Peter Jones CBE is one of Britain's best-known and respected entrepreneurs, a star on TV's Dragons' Den, a philanthropist and investor. He owns a portfolio of businesses ranging from telecoms and leisure to publishing, media and retail.
Peter is devoted to unlocking Britain’s young entrepreneurial talent by revolutionising enterprise education in Britain through the Peter Jones Foundation, of which His Royal Highness The Duke of York, is Patron.
In 2009 he successfully launched the Peter Jones Enterprise Academy which today has over 20 colleges nationwide and is the first-ever UK educational organisation dedicated solely to enterprise and entrepreneurship and training the next generation of aspiring entrepreneurs.
As part of his mission to put enterprise at the heart of education, in 2012, Peter launched a brand new campaign –Tycoon in Schools. With the ultimate goal getting a business started in every school in the UK. The competition has been a huge success receiving the support of the Prime Minister and the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills.
As part of Peter’s commitment to leading enterprise education in the UK, the Peter Jones Foundation this year launched a brand new Higher Apprenticeship in Business Innovation and Growth. Developed in partnership with Pearson and other educational partners, the Apprenticeship enables young people to earn while they learn, while nurturing ‘intrapreneurial’ and confident business leaders, who will energise a company from within.
In 2013, Peter relaunched Jessops, the iconic high street retailer, following a multi-million pound investment to revitalise the largest photographic imaging retailer in Europe.
Again in 2013 and due to his great friendship with Robbie Williams they both joined forces to help build Farrell into a global fashion brand.
