	The longtime leader of Browning Investments Inc. is stepping down from his positions as president and CEO and will be replaced by a former executive of the company.

	Michael G. Browning, who has led the Indianapolis-based real estate development and construction firm since 1981, will maintain his role as chairman of the board, the company announced Tuesday.

	Browning’s new president and CEO, effective Aug. 1, is John F. Hirschman, a real estate attorney at Faegre Baker Daniels LLP. He served as Browning’s director of development from 2005 to 2012.

	While at Browning, Hirschman was responsible for managing the company’s joint venture relationships with Duke Realty Corp. and Prologis Inc., and oversaw the development of several business parks, in addition to industrial, office and mixed-use facilities.

	With 2.2 million square feet completed or under construction locally, Browning ranks as the Indianapolis area’s fifth-largest commercial real estate developer, according to the latest IBJ research.

Maximum Reliability. Maximum Performance.




Real-world reliability is the most important feature any manufacturer can build into a firearm. That’s why it was the first priority when we set about developing the Browning Maxus. But reliability isn’t the whole story. The Maxus delivers 18% less felt recoil for greater comfort, 44% less muzzle jump for more accurate follow-up shots, 19% faster bolt speed and 24% faster lock time than the nearest competitor. Unequaled reliability and features, all found in the finest, most reliable gas-operated autoloader ever to swing on a bird.


















The traditional screw-on magazine cap has been replaced with the patented Speed Lock Forearm. This secure forearm attachment system makes taking down the Maxus for cleaning or storage fast and makes attaching or removing the sling a snap. Read more...





















The Lightning Trigger is designed to offer a smooth, crisp feel with minimal travel. With lock times averaging .0052 seconds, the Lightning Trigger is 24% faster than the nearest competing autoloader. Read more...





















The Power Drive Gas System is the finest gas system on any autoloading shotgun ever. Extensive research and testing have produced a piston design that is extremely reliable in all conditions, regardless of the heavy or light loads being used. Read more...





















Load shells into an empty gun, or quickly unload a full magazine - all without manipulating the bolt






































































The Softest Shooting Autoloader Ever







Felt recoil is more than just an instantaneous peak force; it is the total energy absorbing experience when you fire a shell. While no recoil reduction system can escape the laws of physics, the Maxus will change your mind about recoil control. The Power Drive Gas System, Inflex Technology recoil pad, back-boring and natural Browning balance combine to transfer up to 18% less total felt recoil force to your shoulder than other autoloaders on the market.



















Less Muzzle Jump







Less felt recoil means less muzzle jump and that instantly translates into more birds in your bag. The Power Drive Gas System works perfectly with the Inflex Technology recoil pad to reduce muzzle jump as much as 44% compared to the competition.
