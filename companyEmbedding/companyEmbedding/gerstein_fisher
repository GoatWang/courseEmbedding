BRIDGEPORT, Conn., July 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- People's United Bank, N.A. announced today that its subsidiary, People's Securities, Inc., has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Gerstein Fisher, a $3 billion, New York City-based investment management firm serving individuals and families, institutions, and third-party platforms. The transaction is expected to bring People's United Wealth Management's total assets under administration to nearly $20 billion, of which approximately $8 billion is under discretionary management.








"Gerstein Fisher's well-known quantitative investment approach and scalable technology-enabled platform will build upon the excellent range of investment solutions offered by People's United," said Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The transaction supports recent strategic investments in our fee income businesses and strengthens our New York franchise. We are extremely pleased to welcome this respected firm to the People's Securities and Wealth Management teams."
Founded in 1993 and featured in Barron's "Top 100 Financial Advisors" list for six consecutive years, Gerstein Fisher is one of the country's largest independent boutique investment firms. Gerstein Fisher manages assets using a quantitative Multi-Factor® approach, which structures portfolios to overweight the factors that leading-edge academic research has identified as having the potential to deliver enhanced returns.
"Gerstein Fisher's client focus, quantitative portfolio management and well-rated mutual funds complement People's United's offerings and expertise," said Galan Daukas, Senior Executive Vice President, People's United Wealth Management. "In addition, our partnership will generate excellent opportunities for shared growth throughout our collective geographic footprint."
Gerstein Fisher's Founder and CIO, Gregg S. Fisher, will join People's United as Head of Quantitative Research and Portfolio Strategy. "We look forward to bringing the firm's pioneering Multi-Factor investment approach, as well as the guidance of Gregg Fisher, to our current and future clients," Daukas continued.
"We're very excited to join forces with People's United, as both companies share similar cultures, outstanding client relationships and strong investment performance," said Fisher. "We believe that our investment strategies, combined with People's United's large distribution network, will allow us to help more people invest smartly to achieve their goals than Gerstein Fisher could have on a standalone basis."
The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to customary approvals and consents, including the consent of Gerstein Fisher clients. People's United expects the transaction to be modestly accretive to earnings in 2017 with an IRR of over 15%. The transaction contains a portion of contingent consideration based on the achievement of revenue growth targets.
Berkshire Capital Securities LLC served as financial advisor to People's United. Silver Lane Advisors LLC served as financial advisor to Gerstein Fisher.

REITs in the Spotlight - Gerstein Fisher

REITs in the Spotlight






Tweet














RSS



On September 1, Real Estate will become a distinct sector in the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), elevating it from its former position as part of the Financials sector.
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) offer a diversified, cost-effective, transparent way for investors to access commercial real estate and are available today in nearly 40 countries around the world.
REITs can act as a portfolio diversifier and an inflation hedge; research supports the fact that they also hold up well in periods of rising interest rates.
We believe that holding global vs. US-only REITs can further enhance portfolio risk-adjusted returns and offers exposure to a diversified set of geographic and economic environments.

September 1st will mark an important milestone for the real estate investment trust (aka REIT) industry. Effective that date, real estate will become the 11th sector in the Global Industry Classification Standard—the first new sector since Standard & Poor’s and MSCI formulated GICS in 1999. Here’s how MSCI explains the GICS addition: “With the creation of the new Real Estate Sector, we acknowledge its growing importance in today’s global economy. This change will elevate its position from under the Financial Sector, recognizing Real Estate as a distinct asset class and a foundational building block of a modern portfolio.”
I’m aware of some industry projections that a tsunami of tens of billions of dollars of new capital will pour into real estate once it’s a separate and distinct sector (indeed, the looming change may already have stimulated inflows into REITs this year). I have no idea if those forecasts will be realized, but it is easy to imagine that REITs will attract more money from diversified mutual funds, institutional and other investors simply from its higher profile after it is split off from financials. Additionally, being categorized and traded more distinctly from banks, insurance companies, and other financial companies could also reduce correlations with the broader equity market (which would enhance REITs’ portfolio diversification benefit, a theme I will return to below), improve REIT securities’ liquidity, and lower the sector’s cost of capital.
This stock market development represents an opportunity for investors to review their exposure to diversified real estate and REITs, and I have long believed that many investors are particularly under-allocated to REITs outside the US (nearly 40 countries now have REIT legislation in place). In the balance of this entry, I’ll briefly summarize what I think makes global REITs an attractive asset class for most investment portfolios.
Making Commercial Real Estate More Accessible
The creation of REITs—publicly traded securities that own and operate properties such as office and apartment buildings, shopping centers, hotels, and self-storage facilities—effectively democratized commercial real estate investing. These securities provide investors lacking large pools of capital with exposure (and with excellent liquidity) to commercial projects and professional real estate management. We view REITs as an attractive long-term strategic portfolio holding that generates returns that are highly correlated over market cycles with those of private real estate markets, as measured, for instance, by the National Council of Real Estate Fiduciaries (NCREIF).
Over most extended time periods, say 10 years or longer, REIT returns have been equal to or better than those of equities. For instance, during the 10 years to June 30, 2016, the S&P Global REIT Index returned 6% annualized, compared to just 2.1% for the MSCI EAFE Index of developed-country equities and 7.4% for the S&P 500 Index. But the way REITs and equities generate those returns is quite different, with the lion’s share of equity returns coming from capital appreciation and the bulk of REIT returns stemming from dividends (REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of taxable income—the source of those dividends–to shareholders each year). As an asset manager, I frequently recommend that many investors have distinct and targeted real estate exposure, so that they may own their REITs more heavily within retirement or other tax-advantaged accounts.
Indeed, this hybrid asset class—with bond-like yields and stock-like appreciation potential—offers nice portfolio diversification due to relatively low correlations with other major asset classes. From January 1, 1990 to June 30, 2016, global real estate’s correlation with US and international equities was about 0.6; with US and international bonds (as measured by the US Aggregate Bond Index and Citigroup WGBI 1-5 Year ex US) the correlations were only 0.22 and 0.25, respectively.
I earlier indicated my preference for global—as opposed to US-only—REITs, since international REITs provide exposure to geographic and economic environments ranging from London to Singapore to Sydney. We have conducted a considerable amount of research on how adding 5% to 15% REIT allocations to various equity and equity/fixed income portfolios impacts portfolio returns and volatility. We found that, for instance, adding a helping of REITs (perhaps 5% to 15% of the total portfolio) to all-equity or 80 equity/20 fixed income portfolios produced better risk-adjusted returns. I invite you to read our research paper on this topic, “Investment Insights: Taking a Global Approach to Investing in Public Real Estate.”
REITs and Rates
Finally, I would like to address the link between REITs, inflation, and interest rates. One benefit of REITs is that they can act as a strong hedge against inflation. Historically, REIT yields have been higher than the inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and over most extended periods—in stark contrast with fixed-income securities—the income stream from REITs has increased at a higher rate than CPI. Keep in mind that lease agreements for commercial property typically have clauses that build in inflation adjustments for rental payments based on the CPI or some other inflation index during the lease period.
I am often asked whether rising interest rate cycles (which is bound to occur one of these days) negatively impact REIT prices. Though each scenario is somewhat different, our research shows that REITs have in fact historically performed relatively well in environments of steadily rising rates—outperforming equities and fixed income. Remember that rising rates usually coincide with periods of a strengthening economy and rising inflation, which are generally positive factors for REITs. Exhibit 1 reports the returns of the three asset classes in periods of both rising and falling interest rates from January 1, 1978 to June 30, 2016. Exhibit 2 details how US REITs performed during 10 specific cycles of rising and falling rates during the same 38 ½-year time frame.


While real estate becoming a sector unto its own may generate increased investor interest, at Gerstein Fisher we’ve always felt it has a place in most diversified portfolios, for the reasons outlined above. Real estate securities such as REITs are an effective and diversified way to access global real estate, allowing individual investors to participate in a growing and important segment of the global economy.

Our Team - Gerstein Fisher
























































































Our Team
 




When the Whole Is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts
In many ways, structuring a team is a lot like structuring a portfolio: you need to organize it around an objective and make sure all the parts are working well together and collectively making for a stronger whole.



At Gerstein Fisher, our team is designed in such a way that each group can focus, without distractions, on its respective promise to our clients—whether that is investment management, tax strategy, technology or operations support.
While it may sound like an obvious way to structure a team, it is different from the way many firms in our industry operate. Often, a client’s relationship manager is also selecting his or her investments. The result is that two clients at the same firm with nearly identical financial situations and objectives may end up with two very different looking portfolios, depending on who is constructing them. At Gerstein Fisher, we have very purposely built a dedicated investment platform that allows each of our clients to benefit from our best thinking—still in a way that is tailored to their individual financial objectives and situation.

 
The Investment Strategy Group, led by founder, and Head of Quantitative Research and Portfolio Strategy Gregg S. Fisher, focuses on the formulation and implementation of Gerstein Fisher’s portfolio strategy. Functional responsibilities include macroeconomic and quantitative research, portfolio management, risk management, investment technology and trading.
Our Client Advisory Team works closely with clients to understand their individual financial situations and goals, advise them on wealth management issues, and serve as a conduit to Gerstein Fisher’s Investment Strategy Group. The team includes specialists across disciplines from estate and tax planning to charitable giving and protection planning, allowing us to develop truly integrated solutions for our clients.
The Gerstein Fisher Research Center is a forum for ongoing collaboration between Gerstein Fisher and a select circle of leading finance, risk, and economics professors and uniquely qualified students from prestigious academic institutions. The Center’s main objective is to solve critical issues in finance and risk faced by individual investors through pioneering research that bridges the gap between academic theory and real-world financial practice.
 



 
Our diverse and talented team represents a unique combination of experience, backgrounds, degrees and professional designations.

Our Founder

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 324 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.





3 Yrs





                         Out of
324
 funds
                     	




5 Yrs





                         Out of
275
 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term capital appreciation.




Strategy



Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the fund's net assets will be invested in equity securities. It seeks to invest primarily in common stocks of international companies of any size, including foreign securities and securities of U.S. companies. The fund typically invests in securities of issuers from at least three or more non-U.S. countries, with at least 40% of the fund's net assets invested in foreign securities. It may invest in foreign securities which may include securities of companies in emerging markets or less developed countries.


Risk



Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
10. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 11/2/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
