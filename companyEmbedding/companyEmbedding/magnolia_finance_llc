Magnolia Finance, LLC (“Magnolia Finance” or the “Company”) is a Texas Limited Liability Company that has been established to provide an investment offering for investors to participate in the subprime auto finance market. The Company expects to achieve a rapid start by purchasing qualified contracts from an existing operation called Family Auto Credit, LLC (“Family Auto Credit” or “FAC”). Family Auto Credit is owned by Christopher Inman, who is also a principal owner of Magnolia Finance.
The core concept of Magnolia Finance is to leverage pooled funds to purchase secured assets at a discount. Central to management’s plan is to ensure all funds from its debt holders are secured by cash or assets purchased at a discount to market value. Two examples of such assets are pre-owned vehicles and performing notes purchased from auto dealers or in the market. The Company will provide three basic services to FAC and other selected BHPH (Buy Here, Pay Here) pre-owned auto dealers. These services include, but are not limited to: Floor planning, contract purchasing and management, and servicing of loan portfolios.
 
 
 







 
 
 






The goal of management is to generate profit based on successful purchases of notes and other financing activities. The Company acquires the financing to engage in these efforts by offering notes to qualified individuals.
Magnolia Finance, LLC invites potential accredited investors to carefully review the Company’s Private Placement Memorandum and encourages potential investors to ask questions of management regarding the Company’s forward operational plans and this Offering by calling (972) 795-4725.
The entire Private Placement Memorandum can be seen at: invest.magnoliafinance.net

Asset-Based Lending 
Magnolia Financial offers Asset-Based Lines of credit up to $2 million. With Asset-Based lines of credit, we give you a revolving credit facility utilizing a borrowing base to determine your borrowing capacity. As your business and your accounts receivable grow, so does your credit facility with Magnolia Financial. While our ABL loans are primarily secured by your accounts receivable, we will consider inventory collateral as well.

Purchase Order Financing 
Purchase Order Financing helps bridge the gap between a large purchase order and the capital needed to finance it. Unlike traditional factoring or asset-based lending, Magnolia Financial will help you secure the raw materials to fulfill your order, plus pay your supplier directly so you can get your product to your clients quickly, efficiently and affordably. This allows you to focus on delivering current orders and positions you financially to manage future orders.

Asset-Based Lending Solutions 




Asset-Based Lending
Magnolia's Asset-Based Lending (ABL) program is a revolving line of credit that allows you to borrow money based on the total value of Accounts Receivable and inventory. You can use your line of credit when you need it, rather than on an invoice-by-invoice basis. With an Asset-Based Line of Credit from Magnolia Financial, your ability to borrow grows as you grow, with no long term contracts, early termination fees or unused line fees, giving your business the flexibility it needs to reach its goals.
How does it work?
Magnolia Financial offers Asset-based lines of credit up to $2 million. Instead of factoring or buying your invoices, Magnolia uses a borrowing base to give you a revolving line of credit primarily determined by the bulk availability of your invoices and inventory. As your customers make payments payable to you via our secure lockbox, the payments are immediately applied to your account at Magnolia to reduce your credit line.
Why choose Magnolia Financial?

Draw from a revolving line of credit based on your bulk receivables and inventory that can grow as you grow.
Focus on growing your business, covering costs and meeting new demand without worrying how you'll finance it.
Take advantage of the expertise of your dedicated Account Executive and a management team that's personally interested in your success.

Komado Joe, Kerry Coker 




Kamado Joe, Kerry Coker
 
Challenge:
Kerry Coker and Bobby Brennan started ceramic grill company, Kamado Joe, during the worst economic recession in 70 years. Despite that, they've grown their business an unheard of 80% per year since 2008. In order to fund their rapid growth, they needed access to working capital. With a limited operating history, they did not have success securing traditional bank financing and were referred to Magnolia Financial for an alternative solution.
Solution:
Magnolia's tailored approach to each client initially provided Kamado Joe a very small line of credit to help fund their growth. Instead of having to wait 30, 45 days or more for customers to pay, Kamado Joe had immediate access to cash so they could order products from China and fulfill customer orders. As Kamado Joe continued to grow, so did their credit facility with Magnolia. In addition to borrowing Accounts Receivable, the company also used Inventory Financing to fund their growth.  Kamado Joe's initial credit line of $50K grew to over $2M within just a few years.
Result:
Magnolia provided a necessary bridge for Kamado Joe to grow their business to the point where they could secure traditional bank financing.
 
"The Magnolia guys have a real "can do" attitude. Marc Smith and his team are super responsive and upbeat. They can fund within a matter of days. They are always looking for positive opportunities for their clients. It's a breath of fresh air to work with someone like that." 
 - Kerry Coker, Kamado Joe

Your Small Business Funding Partner

At Magnolia Financial we understand the complexities of securing traditional bank financing and why it can be challenging for banks to finance clients who are seeking working capital. That's why some of our best partners are bankers that refer their clients to us when the bank can't help at the current stage of a company's growth. 
Magnolia Financial is designed to help companies with business-to-business A/R who are poised for growth potential, and we can bridge the gap between where a company is and where it wants to be. Our partners understand and work hand in hand with us to fund their clients in non-traditional ways. Our collective end goal is to help our clients deliver products or services to their customers, have the working capital they need to serve them, and experience growth that positions them for traditional bank funding in the future.
We offer three customized products in order to give your client the best solution:

Accounts Receivable Financing Line of Credit secured by A/R on an invoice-by-invoice basis
Asset-Based Lending Revolving line of credit based on the bulk value of A/R plus other assets
Purchase Order Funding Capital to complete orders before an invoice is generated

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
