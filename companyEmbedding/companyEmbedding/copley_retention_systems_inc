What is Nuro?

 






What people are saying about the Nuro solution



For years, as full-time advisor, faculty member, and now Dean, I have been searching for a solution that collects and integrates students’ cognitive and affective data. Nuro Retention has created that solution and taken it a step further. The easy to use system seamlessly communicates data into the hands of advisors, faculty, and other student success personnel who can best intervene to provide personalized support before it’s too late.
Joshua Smith, Ph.D., Dean, Loyola School of Education


Nuro Retention v 4.0 is the 21st Century’s fulfillment of “Turning Insight into Action.” We have all heard the discussion of “Data Driven Decisions” well, Nuro’s software is that, it encourages schools to use their insights and create cohorts of “at-risk-students” and build initiatives to address their issues. More importantly it provides a fully integrated communication system that works seamlessly with the college’s administrative system. 
Dr. John Padgett, Formerly of City College


I wish I had the Nuro solution available at one of my prior campuses because I know the results, and ROI, would have been strong. Building relevant cohorts and addressing more individualized support for each student leads to stronger engagement and more positive outcomes. Integrating multiple campus data sources, predictive analytics, thoughtful advising practices and careful communication tools has resulted in a wonderfully integrated retention system. 
Dr. Steve Altman, Former President, University of Central Florida


I believe Nuro Retention’s comprehensive software solution, best practices, and tailored approach to implementation are designed to address the unique needs of each institution and their student populations as related to student success.
Dr. Phyllis Collins, Director of Integrated Studies Program, Delaware State University

If this is your company...



We may be able to find you a more suitable carrier for your business insurance.  We have extensive data on carriers, their coverage, and company rates.  Rather than having an agent sell you, why not find which carrier is best for your business and approach them?  Contact Us to see if there is a better fit for your business.  We are not insurance agents, and are not trying to sell you anything.  We will simply tell you some carriers that may be better suited, and suggest agents in your area.

What is an Experience Mod Rating?



The Mod Rating is one of the two most important factors that effect a carrier's premium for workers comp insurance.  Each business in a state is provided a mod rating by the state's rating bureau which is a reflection of the amount of workers comp claims they have had.  If someone has an accident at work, your mod rating will increase and so will your premium.

What is an LCM?



A Loss Cost Multiplier, or LCM, is a rating for an insurance carrier that reflects their overhead in providing coverage for workers comp insurance.  It is one of the two main ratings that effect an insurance premium.  You are more likely to get a better premium from a carrier with a lower LCM, so it is important to know what your carrier's LCM is.  While a premium is generally the result of a formula, carriers are able to deviate plus or minus 25% from that formula.
