Savage IO Launches High-Performance Open Storage Platform SavageStor
Jul 28 15
Savage IO announced the high-performing, more-densely populated Open Storage Platform server on the market SavageStor. Designed without the inherent physical bottlenecks or software incompatibilities of other storage products, SavageStor is an all-in-hardware (server, networking, controller and storage) solution that satisfies the ruthless capacity and IO requirements of cloud storage, big data analytics, HPC, enterprise and ROBO environments. SavageStor provides up to 40% faster compute performance, requires 90% lower management resources, and uses 50% less power and cooling in 75% less floor space to present an ideal alternative to companies that are dissatisfied with their current IT infrastructures. SavageStor can combine HDD or SSD in any configuration of SATA or SAS hard drives, depending on user workload. Four grid-redundant power supplies, an innovative sliding "drive drawer" that allows drives to be swapped without powering down or compromising any cabling in the back, and cabling that delivers speeds up to 25GB per second, maximizing throughput and reliability. Because of its radically efficient engineering, and spectacular density, SavageStor minimizes power consumption and overall footprint for low up-front costs and better long-term cost of ownership. The company's solution, SavageStor 4800, combines a massive front-end SSD cache of 512GB and up to 288TB native capacity in one compact 4U system with an extremely low power footprint. It also features dual CPUs, hard drives, RAID controllers, grid-redundant power supplies and high speed network ports for aggressive reliability.
