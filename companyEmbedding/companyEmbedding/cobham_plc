    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Cobham was founded as Flight Refuelling Limited (FRL) at RAF Ford in Sussex by Sir Alan Cobham in 1934.[3] It moved to Tarrant Rushton in Dorset in 1947.[4] It developed the 'probe and drogue' method of air-to-air refuelling in 1949 and Michael Cobham took over the leadership of the business from his father in 1969.[3] In September 1997 it acquired ML Aviation for £37 million, which had taken over Nash & Thompson, a major competitor, the previous year.[5]
In early 2008 Cobham purchased S-TEC Corporation, maker of general aviation autopilots for $38 million,[6] and in February 2008 Cobham bought the sensor and antenna systems division of BAE Systems for $240 million.[7] Then in June 2008 Cobham acquired Sparta Inc., a US defence business, for $416 million (it was renamed Cobham Analytic Solutions).[8] In September 2008 Cobham completed the purchase of the radio frequency components business of M/A-COM for $425 million.[9] In April 2009 Cobham agreed to purchase Argotek Inc., a provider of high-end information assurance services to the United States Intelligence Community, for $36 million.[10] Then in June 2009 a Cobham – Northrop Grumman 50–50 joint venture won the US Army's US$2.4 billion competition to supply Vehicular Intercom Systems.[11]
In October 2011 Cobham Analytic Solutions was sold for $350 million to the privately owned Parsons Corporation.[12] Then in June 2012 Cobham acquired Danish satellite communications company Thrane & Thrane A/S, making it the core of Cobham's new SATCOM strategic business unit (SBU), to include SeaTel marine, TracStar land and Omnipless airborne SATCOM product lines.[13]
In May 2013 Cobham acquired antenna systems business, Axell Wireless.[14] In July 2013 Cobham bought out FB Heliservices joint venture partner Bristow Helicopters.[15] In April 2014, Cobham sold Chelton Flight Systems and S-TEC Corporation to Genesys Aerosystems.[16] Then in May 2014, Cobham acquired wireless communications company, Aeroflex Holding Corporation for $1.46 billion.[17]
In August 2016, David Lockwood was named CEO, replacing Bob Murphy.[18]
Operations[edit]




Cobham Falcon about to touch down


Cobham is organised into three technology divisions: Mission Systems, Defence Systems and Aerospace & Surveillance:

The Cobham Mission Systems Division claims to be the world market leader in aerial refuelling.[19]


The Cobham Defence Systems Division specialises in radar, communication and electronic warfare systems, and claims to be the world leader in advanced tactical military vehicle intercom systems.[20]


The Cobham Aerospace and Security Division provides a range of electronic products for airborne, marine and land applications.[21]

Cobham Aviation Services, part of Cobham Mission Systems, operates more than 150 fixed and rotary wing aircraft around the world. It specialises in the conversion and support of a wide range of civil and military aircraft, and through an FB Heliservices consortium with Bristow Helicopters at the UK's Defence Helicopter Flying School trains all UK helicopter pilots for the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army.[22]
Products[edit]
Carleton Life Support, a subsidiary of Cobham based in Davenport, Iowa, makes the MK 16 rebreather used by the United States Navy.[23]
The company produces the Guardian ST820, a battery-operated tracing device used by the American FBI. The device is secured under a car by a strong magnet. It is only available to law enforcement agencies.[24]
In his 2015 book Data and Goliath, American security expert Bruce Schneier wrote that Cobham sells a system enabling buyers to send "blind calls" to mobile phones: calls that don't ring, and are undetectable by the recipient. As described by Schneier, the blind call allows the sender to track the phone's location to within one metre. Schneier noted that Cobham's customers include the governments of Algeria, Brunei, Ghana, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States.[25]
Queen's Awards for Enterprise[edit]

2009: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, England, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Domo Ltd – tripled its export sales in three years.[26]
2010: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category. The award was for the development of its Solo4 wireless digital audio and video link technology that improves safety for bomb disposal teams and law enforcement personnel by increasing the range at which they can effectively operate their robotic bomb disposal equipment.[27]
2010: Cobham Antenna Systems, based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Chelton Ltd – continuously increased export revenues over six years and sells over 80% of its production overseas.[27]

Sports club[edit]
The company created Cobham Sports and Social Club, a members' club in Merley, near the main manufacturing site in Wimborne, Dorset, which is used as the ground for Merley Cobham Sports F.C.[28]

History[edit]
Cobham was founded as Flight Refuelling Limited (FRL) at RAF Ford in Sussex by Sir Alan Cobham in 1934.[3] It moved to Tarrant Rushton in Dorset in 1947.[4] It developed the 'probe and drogue' method of air-to-air refuelling in 1949 and Michael Cobham took over the leadership of the business from his father in 1969.[3] In September 1997 it acquired ML Aviation for £37 million, which had taken over Nash & Thompson, a major competitor, the previous year.[5]
In early 2008 Cobham purchased S-TEC Corporation, maker of general aviation autopilots for $38 million,[6] and in February 2008 Cobham bought the sensor and antenna systems division of BAE Systems for $240 million.[7] Then in June 2008 Cobham acquired Sparta Inc., a US defence business, for $416 million (it was renamed Cobham Analytic Solutions).[8] In September 2008 Cobham completed the purchase of the radio frequency components business of M/A-COM for $425 million.[9] In April 2009 Cobham agreed to purchase Argotek Inc., a provider of high-end information assurance services to the United States Intelligence Community, for $36 million.[10] Then in June 2009 a Cobham – Northrop Grumman 50–50 joint venture won the US Army's US$2.4 billion competition to supply Vehicular Intercom Systems.[11]
In October 2011 Cobham Analytic Solutions was sold for $350 million to the privately owned Parsons Corporation.[12] Then in June 2012 Cobham acquired Danish satellite communications company Thrane & Thrane A/S, making it the core of Cobham's new SATCOM strategic business unit (SBU), to include SeaTel marine, TracStar land and Omnipless airborne SATCOM product lines.[13]
In May 2013 Cobham acquired antenna systems business, Axell Wireless.[14] In July 2013 Cobham bought out FB Heliservices joint venture partner Bristow Helicopters.[15] In April 2014, Cobham sold Chelton Flight Systems and S-TEC Corporation to Genesys Aerosystems.[16] Then in May 2014, Cobham acquired wireless communications company, Aeroflex Holding Corporation for $1.46 billion.[17]
In August 2016, David Lockwood was named CEO, replacing Bob Murphy.[18]
Operations[edit]




Cobham Falcon about to touch down


Cobham is organised into three technology divisions: Mission Systems, Defence Systems and Aerospace & Surveillance:

The Cobham Mission Systems Division claims to be the world market leader in aerial refuelling.[19]


The Cobham Defence Systems Division specialises in radar, communication and electronic warfare systems, and claims to be the world leader in advanced tactical military vehicle intercom systems.[20]


The Cobham Aerospace and Security Division provides a range of electronic products for airborne, marine and land applications.[21]

Cobham Aviation Services, part of Cobham Mission Systems, operates more than 150 fixed and rotary wing aircraft around the world. It specialises in the conversion and support of a wide range of civil and military aircraft, and through an FB Heliservices consortium with Bristow Helicopters at the UK's Defence Helicopter Flying School trains all UK helicopter pilots for the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army.[22]
Products[edit]
Carleton Life Support, a subsidiary of Cobham based in Davenport, Iowa, makes the MK 16 rebreather used by the United States Navy.[23]
The company produces the Guardian ST820, a battery-operated tracing device used by the American FBI. The device is secured under a car by a strong magnet. It is only available to law enforcement agencies.[24]
In his 2015 book Data and Goliath, American security expert Bruce Schneier wrote that Cobham sells a system enabling buyers to send "blind calls" to mobile phones: calls that don't ring, and are undetectable by the recipient. As described by Schneier, the blind call allows the sender to track the phone's location to within one metre. Schneier noted that Cobham's customers include the governments of Algeria, Brunei, Ghana, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States.[25]
Queen's Awards for Enterprise[edit]

2009: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, England, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Domo Ltd – tripled its export sales in three years.[26]
2010: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category. The award was for the development of its Solo4 wireless digital audio and video link technology that improves safety for bomb disposal teams and law enforcement personnel by increasing the range at which they can effectively operate their robotic bomb disposal equipment.[27]
2010: Cobham Antenna Systems, based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Chelton Ltd – continuously increased export revenues over six years and sells over 80% of its production overseas.[27]

Sports club[edit]
The company created Cobham Sports and Social Club, a members' club in Merley, near the main manufacturing site in Wimborne, Dorset, which is used as the ground for Merley Cobham Sports F.C.[28]

History[edit]
Cobham was founded as Flight Refuelling Limited (FRL) at RAF Ford in Sussex by Sir Alan Cobham in 1934.[3] It moved to Tarrant Rushton in Dorset in 1947.[4] It developed the 'probe and drogue' method of air-to-air refuelling in 1949 and Michael Cobham took over the leadership of the business from his father in 1969.[3] In September 1997 it acquired ML Aviation for £37 million, which had taken over Nash & Thompson, a major competitor, the previous year.[5]
In early 2008 Cobham purchased S-TEC Corporation, maker of general aviation autopilots for $38 million,[6] and in February 2008 Cobham bought the sensor and antenna systems division of BAE Systems for $240 million.[7] Then in June 2008 Cobham acquired Sparta Inc., a US defence business, for $416 million (it was renamed Cobham Analytic Solutions).[8] In September 2008 Cobham completed the purchase of the radio frequency components business of M/A-COM for $425 million.[9] In April 2009 Cobham agreed to purchase Argotek Inc., a provider of high-end information assurance services to the United States Intelligence Community, for $36 million.[10] Then in June 2009 a Cobham – Northrop Grumman 50–50 joint venture won the US Army's US$2.4 billion competition to supply Vehicular Intercom Systems.[11]
In October 2011 Cobham Analytic Solutions was sold for $350 million to the privately owned Parsons Corporation.[12] Then in June 2012 Cobham acquired Danish satellite communications company Thrane & Thrane A/S, making it the core of Cobham's new SATCOM strategic business unit (SBU), to include SeaTel marine, TracStar land and Omnipless airborne SATCOM product lines.[13]
In May 2013 Cobham acquired antenna systems business, Axell Wireless.[14] In July 2013 Cobham bought out FB Heliservices joint venture partner Bristow Helicopters.[15] In April 2014, Cobham sold Chelton Flight Systems and S-TEC Corporation to Genesys Aerosystems.[16] Then in May 2014, Cobham acquired wireless communications company, Aeroflex Holding Corporation for $1.46 billion.[17]
In August 2016, David Lockwood was named CEO, replacing Bob Murphy.[18]
Operations[edit]




Cobham Falcon about to touch down


Cobham is organised into three technology divisions: Mission Systems, Defence Systems and Aerospace & Surveillance:

The Cobham Mission Systems Division claims to be the world market leader in aerial refuelling.[19]


The Cobham Defence Systems Division specialises in radar, communication and electronic warfare systems, and claims to be the world leader in advanced tactical military vehicle intercom systems.[20]


The Cobham Aerospace and Security Division provides a range of electronic products for airborne, marine and land applications.[21]

Cobham Aviation Services, part of Cobham Mission Systems, operates more than 150 fixed and rotary wing aircraft around the world. It specialises in the conversion and support of a wide range of civil and military aircraft, and through an FB Heliservices consortium with Bristow Helicopters at the UK's Defence Helicopter Flying School trains all UK helicopter pilots for the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army.[22]
Products[edit]
Carleton Life Support, a subsidiary of Cobham based in Davenport, Iowa, makes the MK 16 rebreather used by the United States Navy.[23]
The company produces the Guardian ST820, a battery-operated tracing device used by the American FBI. The device is secured under a car by a strong magnet. It is only available to law enforcement agencies.[24]
In his 2015 book Data and Goliath, American security expert Bruce Schneier wrote that Cobham sells a system enabling buyers to send "blind calls" to mobile phones: calls that don't ring, and are undetectable by the recipient. As described by Schneier, the blind call allows the sender to track the phone's location to within one metre. Schneier noted that Cobham's customers include the governments of Algeria, Brunei, Ghana, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States.[25]
Queen's Awards for Enterprise[edit]

2009: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, England, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Domo Ltd – tripled its export sales in three years.[26]
2010: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category. The award was for the development of its Solo4 wireless digital audio and video link technology that improves safety for bomb disposal teams and law enforcement personnel by increasing the range at which they can effectively operate their robotic bomb disposal equipment.[27]
2010: Cobham Antenna Systems, based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Chelton Ltd – continuously increased export revenues over six years and sells over 80% of its production overseas.[27]

Sports club[edit]
The company created Cobham Sports and Social Club, a members' club in Merley, near the main manufacturing site in Wimborne, Dorset, which is used as the ground for Merley Cobham Sports F.C.[28]

History[edit]
Cobham was founded as Flight Refuelling Limited (FRL) at RAF Ford in Sussex by Sir Alan Cobham in 1934.[3] It moved to Tarrant Rushton in Dorset in 1947.[4] It developed the 'probe and drogue' method of air-to-air refuelling in 1949 and Michael Cobham took over the leadership of the business from his father in 1969.[3] In September 1997 it acquired ML Aviation for £37 million, which had taken over Nash & Thompson, a major competitor, the previous year.[5]
In early 2008 Cobham purchased S-TEC Corporation, maker of general aviation autopilots for $38 million,[6] and in February 2008 Cobham bought the sensor and antenna systems division of BAE Systems for $240 million.[7] Then in June 2008 Cobham acquired Sparta Inc., a US defence business, for $416 million (it was renamed Cobham Analytic Solutions).[8] In September 2008 Cobham completed the purchase of the radio frequency components business of M/A-COM for $425 million.[9] In April 2009 Cobham agreed to purchase Argotek Inc., a provider of high-end information assurance services to the United States Intelligence Community, for $36 million.[10] Then in June 2009 a Cobham – Northrop Grumman 50–50 joint venture won the US Army's US$2.4 billion competition to supply Vehicular Intercom Systems.[11]
In October 2011 Cobham Analytic Solutions was sold for $350 million to the privately owned Parsons Corporation.[12] Then in June 2012 Cobham acquired Danish satellite communications company Thrane & Thrane A/S, making it the core of Cobham's new SATCOM strategic business unit (SBU), to include SeaTel marine, TracStar land and Omnipless airborne SATCOM product lines.[13]
In May 2013 Cobham acquired antenna systems business, Axell Wireless.[14] In July 2013 Cobham bought out FB Heliservices joint venture partner Bristow Helicopters.[15] In April 2014, Cobham sold Chelton Flight Systems and S-TEC Corporation to Genesys Aerosystems.[16] Then in May 2014, Cobham acquired wireless communications company, Aeroflex Holding Corporation for $1.46 billion.[17]
In August 2016, David Lockwood was named CEO, replacing Bob Murphy.[18]
Operations[edit]




Cobham Falcon about to touch down


Cobham is organised into three technology divisions: Mission Systems, Defence Systems and Aerospace & Surveillance:

The Cobham Mission Systems Division claims to be the world market leader in aerial refuelling.[19]


The Cobham Defence Systems Division specialises in radar, communication and electronic warfare systems, and claims to be the world leader in advanced tactical military vehicle intercom systems.[20]


The Cobham Aerospace and Security Division provides a range of electronic products for airborne, marine and land applications.[21]

Cobham Aviation Services, part of Cobham Mission Systems, operates more than 150 fixed and rotary wing aircraft around the world. It specialises in the conversion and support of a wide range of civil and military aircraft, and through an FB Heliservices consortium with Bristow Helicopters at the UK's Defence Helicopter Flying School trains all UK helicopter pilots for the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army.[22]
Products[edit]
Carleton Life Support, a subsidiary of Cobham based in Davenport, Iowa, makes the MK 16 rebreather used by the United States Navy.[23]
The company produces the Guardian ST820, a battery-operated tracing device used by the American FBI. The device is secured under a car by a strong magnet. It is only available to law enforcement agencies.[24]
In his 2015 book Data and Goliath, American security expert Bruce Schneier wrote that Cobham sells a system enabling buyers to send "blind calls" to mobile phones: calls that don't ring, and are undetectable by the recipient. As described by Schneier, the blind call allows the sender to track the phone's location to within one metre. Schneier noted that Cobham's customers include the governments of Algeria, Brunei, Ghana, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States.[25]
Queen's Awards for Enterprise[edit]

2009: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, England, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Domo Ltd – tripled its export sales in three years.[26]
2010: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category. The award was for the development of its Solo4 wireless digital audio and video link technology that improves safety for bomb disposal teams and law enforcement personnel by increasing the range at which they can effectively operate their robotic bomb disposal equipment.[27]
2010: Cobham Antenna Systems, based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Chelton Ltd – continuously increased export revenues over six years and sells over 80% of its production overseas.[27]

Sports club[edit]
The company created Cobham Sports and Social Club, a members' club in Merley, near the main manufacturing site in Wimborne, Dorset, which is used as the ground for Merley Cobham Sports F.C.[28]

History[edit]
Cobham was founded as Flight Refuelling Limited (FRL) at RAF Ford in Sussex by Sir Alan Cobham in 1934.[3] It moved to Tarrant Rushton in Dorset in 1947.[4] It developed the 'probe and drogue' method of air-to-air refuelling in 1949 and Michael Cobham took over the leadership of the business from his father in 1969.[3] In September 1997 it acquired ML Aviation for £37 million, which had taken over Nash & Thompson, a major competitor, the previous year.[5]
In early 2008 Cobham purchased S-TEC Corporation, maker of general aviation autopilots for $38 million,[6] and in February 2008 Cobham bought the sensor and antenna systems division of BAE Systems for $240 million.[7] Then in June 2008 Cobham acquired Sparta Inc., a US defence business, for $416 million (it was renamed Cobham Analytic Solutions).[8] In September 2008 Cobham completed the purchase of the radio frequency components business of M/A-COM for $425 million.[9] In April 2009 Cobham agreed to purchase Argotek Inc., a provider of high-end information assurance services to the United States Intelligence Community, for $36 million.[10] Then in June 2009 a Cobham – Northrop Grumman 50–50 joint venture won the US Army's US$2.4 billion competition to supply Vehicular Intercom Systems.[11]
In October 2011 Cobham Analytic Solutions was sold for $350 million to the privately owned Parsons Corporation.[12] Then in June 2012 Cobham acquired Danish satellite communications company Thrane & Thrane A/S, making it the core of Cobham's new SATCOM strategic business unit (SBU), to include SeaTel marine, TracStar land and Omnipless airborne SATCOM product lines.[13]
In May 2013 Cobham acquired antenna systems business, Axell Wireless.[14] In July 2013 Cobham bought out FB Heliservices joint venture partner Bristow Helicopters.[15] In April 2014, Cobham sold Chelton Flight Systems and S-TEC Corporation to Genesys Aerosystems.[16] Then in May 2014, Cobham acquired wireless communications company, Aeroflex Holding Corporation for $1.46 billion.[17]
In August 2016, David Lockwood was named CEO, replacing Bob Murphy.[18]
Operations[edit]




Cobham Falcon about to touch down


Cobham is organised into three technology divisions: Mission Systems, Defence Systems and Aerospace & Surveillance:

The Cobham Mission Systems Division claims to be the world market leader in aerial refuelling.[19]


The Cobham Defence Systems Division specialises in radar, communication and electronic warfare systems, and claims to be the world leader in advanced tactical military vehicle intercom systems.[20]


The Cobham Aerospace and Security Division provides a range of electronic products for airborne, marine and land applications.[21]

Cobham Aviation Services, part of Cobham Mission Systems, operates more than 150 fixed and rotary wing aircraft around the world. It specialises in the conversion and support of a wide range of civil and military aircraft, and through an FB Heliservices consortium with Bristow Helicopters at the UK's Defence Helicopter Flying School trains all UK helicopter pilots for the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army.[22]
Products[edit]
Carleton Life Support, a subsidiary of Cobham based in Davenport, Iowa, makes the MK 16 rebreather used by the United States Navy.[23]
The company produces the Guardian ST820, a battery-operated tracing device used by the American FBI. The device is secured under a car by a strong magnet. It is only available to law enforcement agencies.[24]
In his 2015 book Data and Goliath, American security expert Bruce Schneier wrote that Cobham sells a system enabling buyers to send "blind calls" to mobile phones: calls that don't ring, and are undetectable by the recipient. As described by Schneier, the blind call allows the sender to track the phone's location to within one metre. Schneier noted that Cobham's customers include the governments of Algeria, Brunei, Ghana, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States.[25]
Queen's Awards for Enterprise[edit]

2009: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, England, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Domo Ltd – tripled its export sales in three years.[26]
2010: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category. The award was for the development of its Solo4 wireless digital audio and video link technology that improves safety for bomb disposal teams and law enforcement personnel by increasing the range at which they can effectively operate their robotic bomb disposal equipment.[27]
2010: Cobham Antenna Systems, based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Chelton Ltd – continuously increased export revenues over six years and sells over 80% of its production overseas.[27]

Sports club[edit]
The company created Cobham Sports and Social Club, a members' club in Merley, near the main manufacturing site in Wimborne, Dorset, which is used as the ground for Merley Cobham Sports F.C.[28]

History[edit]
Cobham was founded as Flight Refuelling Limited (FRL) at RAF Ford in Sussex by Sir Alan Cobham in 1934.[3] It moved to Tarrant Rushton in Dorset in 1947.[4] It developed the 'probe and drogue' method of air-to-air refuelling in 1949 and Michael Cobham took over the leadership of the business from his father in 1969.[3] In September 1997 it acquired ML Aviation for £37 million, which had taken over Nash & Thompson, a major competitor, the previous year.[5]
In early 2008 Cobham purchased S-TEC Corporation, maker of general aviation autopilots for $38 million,[6] and in February 2008 Cobham bought the sensor and antenna systems division of BAE Systems for $240 million.[7] Then in June 2008 Cobham acquired Sparta Inc., a US defence business, for $416 million (it was renamed Cobham Analytic Solutions).[8] In September 2008 Cobham completed the purchase of the radio frequency components business of M/A-COM for $425 million.[9] In April 2009 Cobham agreed to purchase Argotek Inc., a provider of high-end information assurance services to the United States Intelligence Community, for $36 million.[10] Then in June 2009 a Cobham – Northrop Grumman 50–50 joint venture won the US Army's US$2.4 billion competition to supply Vehicular Intercom Systems.[11]
In October 2011 Cobham Analytic Solutions was sold for $350 million to the privately owned Parsons Corporation.[12] Then in June 2012 Cobham acquired Danish satellite communications company Thrane & Thrane A/S, making it the core of Cobham's new SATCOM strategic business unit (SBU), to include SeaTel marine, TracStar land and Omnipless airborne SATCOM product lines.[13]
In May 2013 Cobham acquired antenna systems business, Axell Wireless.[14] In July 2013 Cobham bought out FB Heliservices joint venture partner Bristow Helicopters.[15] In April 2014, Cobham sold Chelton Flight Systems and S-TEC Corporation to Genesys Aerosystems.[16] Then in May 2014, Cobham acquired wireless communications company, Aeroflex Holding Corporation for $1.46 billion.[17]
In August 2016, David Lockwood was named CEO, replacing Bob Murphy.[18]
Operations[edit]




Cobham Falcon about to touch down


Cobham is organised into three technology divisions: Mission Systems, Defence Systems and Aerospace & Surveillance:

The Cobham Mission Systems Division claims to be the world market leader in aerial refuelling.[19]


The Cobham Defence Systems Division specialises in radar, communication and electronic warfare systems, and claims to be the world leader in advanced tactical military vehicle intercom systems.[20]


The Cobham Aerospace and Security Division provides a range of electronic products for airborne, marine and land applications.[21]

Cobham Aviation Services, part of Cobham Mission Systems, operates more than 150 fixed and rotary wing aircraft around the world. It specialises in the conversion and support of a wide range of civil and military aircraft, and through an FB Heliservices consortium with Bristow Helicopters at the UK's Defence Helicopter Flying School trains all UK helicopter pilots for the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army.[22]
Products[edit]
Carleton Life Support, a subsidiary of Cobham based in Davenport, Iowa, makes the MK 16 rebreather used by the United States Navy.[23]
The company produces the Guardian ST820, a battery-operated tracing device used by the American FBI. The device is secured under a car by a strong magnet. It is only available to law enforcement agencies.[24]
In his 2015 book Data and Goliath, American security expert Bruce Schneier wrote that Cobham sells a system enabling buyers to send "blind calls" to mobile phones: calls that don't ring, and are undetectable by the recipient. As described by Schneier, the blind call allows the sender to track the phone's location to within one metre. Schneier noted that Cobham's customers include the governments of Algeria, Brunei, Ghana, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States.[25]
Queen's Awards for Enterprise[edit]

2009: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, England, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Domo Ltd – tripled its export sales in three years.[26]
2010: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category. The award was for the development of its Solo4 wireless digital audio and video link technology that improves safety for bomb disposal teams and law enforcement personnel by increasing the range at which they can effectively operate their robotic bomb disposal equipment.[27]
2010: Cobham Antenna Systems, based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Chelton Ltd – continuously increased export revenues over six years and sells over 80% of its production overseas.[27]

Sports club[edit]
The company created Cobham Sports and Social Club, a members' club in Merley, near the main manufacturing site in Wimborne, Dorset, which is used as the ground for Merley Cobham Sports F.C.[28]

Operations[edit]




Cobham Falcon about to touch down


Cobham is organised into three technology divisions: Mission Systems, Defence Systems and Aerospace & Surveillance:

The Cobham Mission Systems Division claims to be the world market leader in aerial refuelling.[19]


The Cobham Defence Systems Division specialises in radar, communication and electronic warfare systems, and claims to be the world leader in advanced tactical military vehicle intercom systems.[20]


The Cobham Aerospace and Security Division provides a range of electronic products for airborne, marine and land applications.[21]

Cobham Aviation Services, part of Cobham Mission Systems, operates more than 150 fixed and rotary wing aircraft around the world. It specialises in the conversion and support of a wide range of civil and military aircraft, and through an FB Heliservices consortium with Bristow Helicopters at the UK's Defence Helicopter Flying School trains all UK helicopter pilots for the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army.[22]
Products[edit]
Carleton Life Support, a subsidiary of Cobham based in Davenport, Iowa, makes the MK 16 rebreather used by the United States Navy.[23]
The company produces the Guardian ST820, a battery-operated tracing device used by the American FBI. The device is secured under a car by a strong magnet. It is only available to law enforcement agencies.[24]
In his 2015 book Data and Goliath, American security expert Bruce Schneier wrote that Cobham sells a system enabling buyers to send "blind calls" to mobile phones: calls that don't ring, and are undetectable by the recipient. As described by Schneier, the blind call allows the sender to track the phone's location to within one metre. Schneier noted that Cobham's customers include the governments of Algeria, Brunei, Ghana, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States.[25]
Queen's Awards for Enterprise[edit]

2009: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, England, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Domo Ltd – tripled its export sales in three years.[26]
2010: Cobham Surveillance, based in Segensworth, Hampshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category. The award was for the development of its Solo4 wireless digital audio and video link technology that improves safety for bomb disposal teams and law enforcement personnel by increasing the range at which they can effectively operate their robotic bomb disposal equipment.[27]
2010: Cobham Antenna Systems, based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category. The business – formerly known as Chelton Ltd – continuously increased export revenues over six years and sells over 80% of its production overseas.[27]

Sports club[edit]
The company created Cobham Sports and Social Club, a members' club in Merley, near the main manufacturing site in Wimborne, Dorset, which is used as the ground for Merley Cobham Sports F.C.[28]

Upon arrival, the aircraft were attacked by hostile ground forces, resulting in significant battle damage causing multiple system failures, including the fuel system aboard all three aircraft. To make it safely back to base, numerous in-flight refuellings were necessary to ensure the aircraft had enough fuel. Each CV-22 is equipped with a Cobham telescopic probe which enables it to take on fuel from hose and drogue equipped tankers, extending its operational range.

This mission has been deemed the most meritorious flight of 2013, earning the crews involved the prestigious Mackay Trophy, awarded by the National Aeronautic Association in the US. The full story of this mission, as disclosed by AFSOC, appears below.
