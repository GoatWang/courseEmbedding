Life and career[edit]
Warnock was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. He failed mathematics in ninth grade but graduated from Olympus High School in 1958.[1] He currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is married and has three children. Warnock has a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Philosophy, a Master of Science in Mathematics, a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Computer Science), and an honorary degree in Science, all from the University of Utah. At the University of Utah he was a member of the Gamma Beta Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.[2] He also has an honorary degree from the American Film Institute.
Warnock's earliest publication and subject of his master's thesis, was his 1964 proof of a theorem solving the Jacobson radical for row-finite matrices,[3] which was originally posed by the American mathematician Nathan Jacobson in 1956.
In 1976, while Warnock worked at Evans & Sutherland, a Salt Lake City-based computer graphics company, the concepts of the PostScript language were seeded. Prior to co-founding Adobe, with Geschke and Putman, Warnock worked with Geschke at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC), where he had started in 1978. Unable to convince Xerox management of the approach to commercialize the InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, he, together with Geschke and Putman, left Xerox to start Adobe in 1982. At their new company, they developed an equivalent technology, PostScript, from scratch, and brought it to market for Apple's LaserWriter in 1985.
In his 1969 doctoral thesis, Warnock invented the Warnock algorithm for hidden surface determination in computer graphics.[4] It works by recursive subdivision of a scene until areas are obtained that are trivial to compute. It solves the problem of rendering a complicated image by avoiding the problem. If the scene is simple enough to compute then it is rendered; otherwise it is divided into smaller parts and the process is repeated.[5] Warnock notes that for this work he received "the dubious distinction of having written the shortest doctoral thesis in University of Utah history".[1]
In the Spring of 1991, Warnock outlined a system called "Camelot",[6] that evolved into the Portable Document Format (PDF) file-format. The goal of Camelot was to "effectively capture documents from any application, send electronic versions of these documents anywhere, and view and print these documents on any machines". Warnock's document contemplated, "Imagine if the IPS (Interchange PostScript) viewer is also equipped with text searching capabilities. In this case the user could find all documents that contain a certain word or phrase, and then view that word or phrase in context within the document. Entire libraries could be archived in electronic form..."
One of Adobe's popular typefaces, Warnock, is named after him.
Adobe's PostScript technology made it easier to print text and images from a computer, revolutionizing media and publishing in the 1980s.
In 2003 Warnock and his wife donated 200,000 shares of Adobe Systems valued at over 5.7 million dollars[7] to the University of Utah as the main gift for a new engineering building. The John E. and Marva M. Warnock Engineering Building was completed in 2007 and houses the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and the Dean of the University of Utah College of Engineering.
Dr. Warnock holds seven patents. In addition to Adobe Systems, he serves or has served on the board of directors at ebrary, Knight-Ridder, MongoNet, Netscape Communications and Salon Media Group. Warnock is a past Chairman of the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the American Film Institute and the Sundance Institute.
Hobbies include photography, skiing, Web development, painting, hiking, curation of rare scientific books and historical Native American objects.[8]
A strong supporter of higher education, Warnock and his wife, Marva, have supported three presidential endowed chairs in computer science, mathematics and fine arts at the University of Utah and also an endowed chair in medical research at Stanford University.
Recognition[edit]
The recipient of numerous scientific and technical awards, Warnock won the Software Systems Award from the Association for Computing Machinery in 1989.[9] In 1995 Warnock received the University of Utah Distinguished Alumnus Award and in 1999 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Warnock was awarded the Edwin H. Land Medal from the Optical Society of America in 2000.[10] In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for "his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing."[11] Oxford University's Bodleian Library bestowed the Bodley Medal on Warnock in November, 2003.[12] [13] In 2004, Warnock received the Lovelace Medal from the British Computer Society in London.[14] In October 2006, Warnock—along with Adobe co-founder Charles Geschke—received the American Electronics Association's Annual Medal of Achievement Award, being the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008, Warnock and Geschke received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society "for inventing PostScript and PDF and helping to launch the desktop publishing revolution and change the way people engage with information and entertainment".[15] In September 2009, Warnock and Geschke were chosen to receive the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, one of the nation's highest honors bestowed on scientists, engineers and inventors.[16][17] In 2010, Warnock and Geschke received the Marconi Prize, considered the highest honor specifically for contributions to information science and communications.[18]
Warnock is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, the latter being America's oldest learned society.
He has received Honorary Degrees from the University of Utah, American Film Institute and The University of Nottingham, UK.[19]

Warnock has a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Philosophy, a Master of Science in Mathematics, a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Computer Science), and an honorary degree in Science, all from the University of Utah. At the University of Utah he was a member of the Gamma Beta Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.[2] He also has an honorary degree from the American Film Institute.
Warnock's earliest publication and subject of his master's thesis, was his 1964 proof of a theorem solving the Jacobson radical for row-finite matrices,[3] which was originally posed by the American mathematician Nathan Jacobson in 1956.
In 1976, while Warnock worked at Evans & Sutherland, a Salt Lake City-based computer graphics company, the concepts of the PostScript language were seeded. Prior to co-founding Adobe, with Geschke and Putman, Warnock worked with Geschke at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC), where he had started in 1978. Unable to convince Xerox management of the approach to commercialize the InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, he, together with Geschke and Putman, left Xerox to start Adobe in 1982. At their new company, they developed an equivalent technology, PostScript, from scratch, and brought it to market for Apple's LaserWriter in 1985.
In his 1969 doctoral thesis, Warnock invented the Warnock algorithm for hidden surface determination in computer graphics.[4] It works by recursive subdivision of a scene until areas are obtained that are trivial to compute. It solves the problem of rendering a complicated image by avoiding the problem. If the scene is simple enough to compute then it is rendered; otherwise it is divided into smaller parts and the process is repeated.[5] Warnock notes that for this work he received "the dubious distinction of having written the shortest doctoral thesis in University of Utah history".[1]
In the Spring of 1991, Warnock outlined a system called "Camelot",[6] that evolved into the Portable Document Format (PDF) file-format. The goal of Camelot was to "effectively capture documents from any application, send electronic versions of these documents anywhere, and view and print these documents on any machines". Warnock's document contemplated, "Imagine if the IPS (Interchange PostScript) viewer is also equipped with text searching capabilities. In this case the user could find all documents that contain a certain word or phrase, and then view that word or phrase in context within the document. Entire libraries could be archived in electronic form..."
One of Adobe's popular typefaces, Warnock, is named after him.
Adobe's PostScript technology made it easier to print text and images from a computer, revolutionizing media and publishing in the 1980s.
In 2003 Warnock and his wife donated 200,000 shares of Adobe Systems valued at over 5.7 million dollars[7] to the University of Utah as the main gift for a new engineering building. The John E. and Marva M. Warnock Engineering Building was completed in 2007 and houses the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and the Dean of the University of Utah College of Engineering.
Dr. Warnock holds seven patents. In addition to Adobe Systems, he serves or has served on the board of directors at ebrary, Knight-Ridder, MongoNet, Netscape Communications and Salon Media Group. Warnock is a past Chairman of the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the American Film Institute and the Sundance Institute.
Hobbies include photography, skiing, Web development, painting, hiking, curation of rare scientific books and historical Native American objects.[8]
A strong supporter of higher education, Warnock and his wife, Marva, have supported three presidential endowed chairs in computer science, mathematics and fine arts at the University of Utah and also an endowed chair in medical research at Stanford University.
Recognition[edit]
The recipient of numerous scientific and technical awards, Warnock won the Software Systems Award from the Association for Computing Machinery in 1989.[9] In 1995 Warnock received the University of Utah Distinguished Alumnus Award and in 1999 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Warnock was awarded the Edwin H. Land Medal from the Optical Society of America in 2000.[10] In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for "his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing."[11] Oxford University's Bodleian Library bestowed the Bodley Medal on Warnock in November, 2003.[12] [13] In 2004, Warnock received the Lovelace Medal from the British Computer Society in London.[14] In October 2006, Warnock—along with Adobe co-founder Charles Geschke—received the American Electronics Association's Annual Medal of Achievement Award, being the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008, Warnock and Geschke received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society "for inventing PostScript and PDF and helping to launch the desktop publishing revolution and change the way people engage with information and entertainment".[15] In September 2009, Warnock and Geschke were chosen to receive the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, one of the nation's highest honors bestowed on scientists, engineers and inventors.[16][17] In 2010, Warnock and Geschke received the Marconi Prize, considered the highest honor specifically for contributions to information science and communications.[18]
Warnock is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, the latter being America's oldest learned society.
He has received Honorary Degrees from the University of Utah, American Film Institute and The University of Nottingham, UK.[19]

Dr. Charles M. Geschke & John E. WarnockCo-founders of Adobe Systems Inc.Founded: 1982"Our only real cleverness was in the perception of what was happening, and in being quick enough on our feet to take advantage of if."-Dr. Charles M. Geschke Mention the names Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, and most people immediately know whom you're talking about. But mention the names Dr. Charles M. Geschke and John E. Warnock, and chances are you'll be met with blank stares. Ironically, these two publicity-shy high-tech trailblazers played major roles in the success of both Microsoft and Apple. In fact, without the PostScript language created by the company Geschke and Warnock co-founded, Adobe Systems Inc., desktop publishing as we know it wouldn't exist.Like many Silicon Valley firms, Adobe was a spin-off of a bigger company-in this case, Xerox Corp. Geschke and Warnock first met and began working together at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), where they helped develop Xerox's page-description language, Interpress. The language won accolades within the corporation, but to Geschke and Warnock's dismay, Xerox decided to keep the technology proprietary rather that release it to public domain. Geschke and Warnock were flabbergasted by the decision. As Geschke explains in a 1987 PC Week interview, "We didn't see how you could make an industrywide standard with something that was proprietary."Deciding that they could "get old and gray and frustrated somewhere else and have more fun," Geschke and Warnock left PARC to found Adobe Systems Inc. in late 1982. Originally, they planned to build a copy-service business, but quickly abandoned the idea. Next, they considered offering a complete turnkey system for office printing, but dismissed that idea as well when they realized that the industry would probably head in a different direction.Finally, they decided to concentrate on what they did best-developing specialized printing software. The result of this decision was the Adobe PostScript page-description language. A revolutionary breakthrough in printing technology, PostScript was the first printing software that enabled users to print pages that included text, line art and digitized photos.Realizing that their best chance for success lay in making PostScript an industry standard, Adobe quickly made the PostScript language public domain. But if the product was public domain, and therefore free, how could Adobe make money from its new software? Simple: Without the PostScript program that interprets the PostScript language, the language itself is useless. In a unique twist on the classic "sell them the razor cheap then make your profits on supplying the blades," Adobe would make its money from selling the PostScript interpreter, which executes page descriptions generated by other software packages, such as desktop publishing and word processing programs. In addition, the company would also provide original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) with designs for interpreter boards to be used in their printers.The strategy worked. By the end of their first year in business, Geschke and Warnock had licensed PostScript to Apple Computer Inc., which in turn introduced the first PostScript-based laser printer, the Apple LaserWriter, in January 1985. And thus, the PostScript laser printer industry was born.Thanks to what Geschke has described as a unique combination of forward thinking, marketing savvy, timing and luck, Adobe was a success almost from the very start. By the end of 1984, it was posting revenue of $2.2 million, which grew to $16 million by the beginning of 1986. Based on their rapidly increasing revenue, Geschke and Warnock made an initial public offering in August 1986, and Adobe stock immediately became one of Wall Street's darlings. It rocketed from $11 to a peak of $56 in May 1987 (which in reality was a $112 peak, considering and earlier 2-for-1 stock split).But more important, by 1987, Adobe's PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language. More than 400 third-party software programs supported PostScript, and Adobe boasted licensing agreements with 19 printer companies (including IBM, Digital, AST and Texas Instruments). Even Hewlett-Packard, which had initially refused to endorse the language in any way, was forced to adopt PostScript. To further increase PostScript's popularity, Adobe began building what would eventually become the world's largest typeface library.With PostScript firmly entrenched as the industry standard, Geschke and Warnock branched out into the end-user software market with the release of Adobe Illustrator in March 1987. This high-end graphic package for professional artists and illustrators was an instant hit with both users and critics.By 1993, Illustrator had also become an industry standard; Adobe's second software program, PhotoShop (another professional graphics package that enables users to manipulate both black-and-white and color photographs), was generating impressive reviews and even more impressive sales; and Adobe's typeface library had grown to include 1,800 fonts.Flush with this success, Geschke and Warnock set their sights on a new goal: creating a "paperless office." To this end, they developed Adobe Acrobat, an innovative program that enables users to create documents that others can view regardless of their application software. In a brilliant marketing move, Adobe decided to offer Acrobat Reader, the program needed to view Acrobat documents, free of charge. Instead, they would charge for Acrobat Distiller, the program that creates Acrobat documents. Although it's not the raging success PostScript or Illustrator were, Acrobat is widely used for transferring, sharing and viewing documents electronically.The duo's next big move was to join forces with Aldus Corp., the creator of the popular desktop publishing program PageMaker, in 1994. The merger handed Adobe unquestioned leadership of the publishing-software market, creating one vendor with a broad array of products that covers both Windows and Macintosh users.Adobe's position as "king of the hill" would not go unchallenged, however. By 1996, the once undisputed ruler of desktop publishing was losing market share to Quark Corp.-whose Quark Xpress desktop publishing program had muscled PageMaker out of the top spot in the Macintosh market-and Corel Corp., whose CorelDraw was gaining ground on Illustrator in the Windows market.Rather than go toe-to-toe with these two up-and-coming contenders, Geschke and Warnock decided to change the rules on their competitors. They attempted to reposition Adobe as a high-profile World Wide Web publisher with the release of two Web-page authoring tools: PageMill and SiteMill. They also retooled Illustrator, PageMaker and PhotoShop to include Web-content creation tools. The gambit proved worthwhile, as Adobe once again became the kingpin of the professional graphics market, averaging nearly $900 million in sales in 1998.By 1999, Adobe found itself competing with a new, more powerful challenger-software titan Microsoft. Before Microsoft's emergence in the image-editing market, many industry analysts had noticed a change in Adobe. While it was still producing innovative products, sales were down, mostly because its marketing and PR efforts seemed to stall. PC Magazine columnist John C. Dvorak suggests that was partially due to the continually increasing isolation of both Geschke and Warnock, which Dvorak proposes was caused by Geschke's abduction by terrorists in 1992.Whatever the future may hold for Geschke and Warnock, one thing is certain-Adobe's influence on the computer industry and image editing will be apparent for decades to come. Whether you browse the World Wide Web, flip through a magazine or newspaper, pick up a product box, or look up at a billboard, chances are the images and text were created with one or more Adobe products. Five Days Of TerrorOn May 25, 1992, an event occurred that would rock Silicon Valley. On his way to Adobe's headquarters in Mountain View, California, Charles Geschke was abducted by two kidnappers who demanded $650,000 in ransom for his return. Geschke's family was instructed to put the ransom in a knapsack and drop it off at an isolated beach. FBI agents hiding nearby lost one of the kidnappers in the fog as he was picking up the ransom, but captured him several hours later. During questioning, the kidnapper revealed the location where Geschke was being held, and Geschke was returned to his family after five days in captivity.Book WormIn what very well may be one of the computer industry's greatest ironies, "paperless office" prophet and Adobe Acrobat apostle John Warnock has a passion for old books. His extensive collection of rare first editions includes literary treasures ranging from a 16th century Euclid tome to all of Charles Darwin's books.

John E. Warnock


Awarded the Marconi Prize in 2010
Cited for his contributions in the field of industry-standard printing and imaging technology.
The 2010 Marconi Society Prize will be awarded to Adobe Systems founders, John E. Warnock and Charles M. Geschke, visionary business leaders and technological innovators who together helped fundamentally transform the world of print communications from a manual, mechanical process to a digital work flow. The two were selected for the prestigious award considered the highest honor specifically devoted to the field of communications and information science for their research on printing and imaging technology and their development of Adobe® PostScript®, a revolutionary software technology that is now the worldwide printing and imaging standard used by print service providers, publishers, corporations and government agencies around the globe.
The duo will be awarded the $100,000 Marconi Prize October 15th at the annual Marconi Awards Dinner at the Rosewood Hotel in Menlo Park, CA.
“The selection of Charles M. Geschke and John E. Warnock as co-recipients of the 2010 Marconi Prize signals the evolving nature of what we mean by communications technology,” said Jim Massey, the 1999 Marconi Award winner and Fellow.
The Marconi Society, established in 1975, annually recognizes a living scientist whose work in the field of communications and information technology advances the social, economic and cultural improvement of all humanity. Recent winners have included Bell Labs scientists Andrew Chraplyvy and Robert Tkach for their work on optical fiber communication systems; Professor David Payne of the University of Southampton in the UK, another optical fiber pioneer who led the development of the erbium-doped optical fiber amplifier; Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page; MIT Professor Ron Rivest, co-inventor of RSA encryption; Stanford Professor John Cioffi, the inventor of modern high speed modems that enabled DSL; and Vint Cerf, most commonly known as the father of the Internet who developed the first commercial email system.
Geschke and Warnock met in the late-70’s in Silicon Valley. Geschke had recently received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon and Warnock had received his from the University of Utah. Geschke worked as a researcher and group manager in the computer science lab at Xerox PARC, a renowned research center responsible for such important developments as laser printing, Ethernet, the modern personal computer graphical user interface (GUI), ubiquitous computing, and very-large-scale-integration (VLSI). Warnock worked for Evans & Sutherland at Ames Research Laboratory.
In 1978, Geschke interviewed and hired Warnock for a position at PARC. From the start, their similar backgrounds and philosophies forged a close bond between them.
In 1979, while at PARC, Warnock and a coworker created the precursor to PostScript, a device- independent system called JaM that incorporated graphics. Convinced of its potential, Warnock and Geschke continued to work on its further development. In 1980 Geschke started the Imaging Sciences Laboratory at Xerox, dedicated to exploring graphics and printing. The new team produced Interpress, a melding of JaM and Xerox’s existing printing language. Though somewhat compromised by the many protocols of Xerox, Interpress was a significant advance. But though the Xerox PARC team was excited at the potential of Interpress, Xerox Corporation decided not to include it among the firm’s commercial products.
Undeterred, Warnock and Geschke sensed an opportunity. If Xerox was not going to seize this moment, they were prepared to do it themselves. In 1982 they formed a new company, Adobe Systems, named after the creek that ran behind Warnock’s Los Altos home.
They needed funding. A former teacher of Warnock’s suggested they meet with venture capitalist, Bill Hambrecht of the Hambrecht and Quist venture capital firm. Geschke and Warnock unveiled a complicated business plan to develop systems composed of high-powered workstations and printers for in-house use at large corporations. Leveraging PostScript’s device-independent design, the workstation would be connected to a laser printer for draft copies and to a typesetter for camera ready output. Six other companies were trying to do the same thing; Hambrecht found the proposal so appealing he wrote them a personal check for $50,000 for startup costs. They shook hands and later received $2.5 million dollars from Hambrecht and Quist.
It was the only venture capital Adobe ever needed. They moved the business out of their homes, and quickly built a small organization that included a few close associates. Their first product, PostScript, bore little resemblance to Xerox’s Interpress; technically it was much closer to JaM, but mindful of PostScript’s origins as the Design System at Evans and Sutherland, Adobe entered into a licensing agreement with Warnock’s former employer to avoid any intellectual property issues.
Then they made a critical and fortunate decision. They had always believed they would be manufacturing hardware but they came to a startling realization: by opting for a technology licensing business model, they were relieved of the burden of manufacturing yet could profit handsomely.
They soon were attracting the attention of Silicon Valley’s heavy hitters, including Steve Jobs, who offered them a considerable sum for their business. It only served to confirm the value of what they’d created. (When Jobs, realized they wouldn’t sell him the company, he instead invested $2.5 million in Adobe. Apple cashed out the stock six years later for $87 million.)
The compatibility and success of the Adobe-Apple relationship lay in a shared belief¬ that technology could transcend ordinary computing to achieve a higher aesthetic purpose. Jobs, Warnock and Geschke believed their companies should stand at the intersection of art and technology. The Mac was the first computer with commercially available graphical user interface and Apple was doing typography on the screen, while with PostScript Adobe was doing type on the printed page. Apple’s LaserWriter, the world’s first Adobe PostScript printer, the Macintosh, and Aldus Pagemaker enabled Adobe, Apple and Aldus to launch the Desktop Publishing revolution.
By the end of 1985, the market had embraced PostScript, which fundamentally improved the cost, productivity and efficiency of the graphic arts, printing and publishing businesses. Geschke and Warnock’s fledging company had taken communications to a new level and in little more than 10 years transformed the world of print communications from a manual, mechanical process to a digital work flow. Today all communications technologies are converting to digital and Adobe’s products continue to expand the technological frontiers of photography, video production, animation, digital communication and the World Wide Web. Its ubiquitous programs include, among others, Adobe Photoshop®, Illustrator®, Acrobat®, InDesign®, Adobe Premiere®, and Adobe Flash®.
Adobe’s success has grown over the decades. It acquired over 20 companies and invested in many more, always driven by the vision and collaboration between Warnock and Geschke.
Bill Hambrecht, the founder of Hambrecht & Quist says it best, “The mutual trust and respect for each other’s ideas never wavered. I honestly have never seen a better partnership; it’s truly unique. They always stayed in sync with each other and were both visionaries in the business. From a two employee business in Los Altos, California to over 7,000 employees world-wide, the Adobe culture has always remained the same. Care and concern, taking responsibility, managing well and loving your job, are the cornerstones of the Adobe way of life. The skills for their craft, coupled with their ability to see beyond the curve of their profession have allowed them to transform step by step, an entire universe of work. I was taught so much by them.”
Artists, graphic designers, writers, printers, publishers have all experienced the Adobe products that have transformed their particular fields but probably no one has felt the impact like web users. PDF, like PostScript has become another industry standard.
Charles Geschke retired from active management as president of Adobe in 2000. John Warnock stepped aside as CEO in 2000 and retired in early 2001. Today Geschke and Warnock are co-chairmen of the board.
Warnock continues to be active in the software industry. He is a frequent speaker on the impact of computing technologies on business and publishing. He is active on or a past member of several business and nonprofit boards in addition to Adobe, including the Sundance Institute, the American Film Institute, and the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. He is also on the board of ebrary, MongoNet, and the chairman of the board of the Salon Media Group.
Geschke and Warnock have both been honored countless times for their technical and managerial achievements. In 1999 both were inducted as Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery. They received the AeA Annual Medal of Achievement Award from the American Electronics Association in 2006, and are the first software executives to receive this honor. Geschke and Warnock were among the 2008 winners of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, which is the USA’s highest honor for technological and scientific achievement and both were honored for their pioneering contributions that spurred the desktop publishing revolution and for changing the way people create and engage with information and entertainment across multiple mediums including print, Web and video.
In addition, both have won awards from the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); the National Computer Graphics Association; and the Rochester Institute of Technology. They have also received the Entrepreneur of the Year award from Ernst & Young, Merrill Lynch and Inc. Magazine, and the ACM Systems Award. Warnock is the recipient of the Bodleian Medal; the Land Medal; and the Lovelace Medal and a member of the Philosophical Society. They are members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, founded by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, and the National Academy of Engineering.
Geschke is a recipient of the John W. Gardner Leadership Award. He is a board member for several educational, arts and non-profit organizations. Geschke is a trustee emeritus of the University of San Francisco and currently holds the Rossi Chair in Entrepreneurship at the USF School of Business. He is a member of the computer science advisory board of Carnegie-Mellon University and Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. He is a board member of Tableau Software. He also serves on the boards of the San Francisco Symphony, the Commonwealth Club of California, the Egan Maritime Foundation, the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management, and the Nantucket Boys & Girls Club. “Geschke and Warnock’s leadership of Adobe has been, and still is today, characterized by technical progress coupled with social responsibility,” noted Massey. “Adobe is always near the top in rankings of a ‘good place to work’ and ‘environmental concern’. They emphasized service of Adobe to the community. In winning the Marconi Prize, their entrepreneurial leadership was as important as their extraordinary scientific achievements.”

Programmers At Work



John Warnock-1986


John Warnock
Born in 1940 and raised in Utah, John Warnock was educated at the University of Utah, where he received both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in mathematics, and a Ph.D. in computer science. He switched to computer science at the time Dave Evans established the famed research and development group to study interactive design and computer graphics at the University of Utah. After completing his studies, Warnock tried his hand at being an entrepreneur with a company in Vancouver, British Columbia, for a short time, then he joined Computer Sciences of Canada and worked in Toronto. After that he traveled to Washington, D.C., where he was employed at the Goddard Space Flight Center.In 1972, Warnock moved to California to work with Dave Evans and Ivan Sutherland on the Illiac IV Project, the NASA space flight shuttle simulator, and airplane simulators. In 1978, Warnock went to Xerox PARC where he spent four years working in the Computer Sciences Laboratory. While at Xerox PARC, Warnock worked on improving the typographic quality of computer gray-scale displays.In 1982, Drs. John E. Warnock and Charles M. Geshchke formed Adobe Systems to develop software that integrates text and graphics, and is also output device independent. Their effort resulted in PostScript, Adobe System’s first product.One can’t help but notice the sign for Adobe Systems as you enter the company’s office building, located in Palo Alto off of the Embarcadero, a road dotted with high-tech companies. The sign is rather large and it shines like gold. It is indicative of the success Warnock’s company has recently experienced. Like so many others, Warnock took his ideas out of Xerox PARC into the real world, where he turned them into a language, PostScript, and a company, Adobe System’s.John Warnock has a professorial look, with a full beard and tousled brown hair. He has an unassuming air and a casual manner. He wore a tweed jacket, a white shirt with an open collar, and wool slacks. His corner office is impressive, with clean lines and a contemporary look. I got the impression my visit was one of many Warnock has received since his company has met with such success. We swapped gripes about being on the road for so long. These days, the time Warnock spends programming is restricted to doing routines with PostScript, but he remains one of the programming wonders of our time.
INTERVIEWER: What was it like at the University of Utah computer center while you were there in the mid-sixties?
WARNOCK: It was quite interesting because Dave Evans, who had been at Berkeley, got a huge ARPA research and development grant for about five million dollars a year to develop interactive design and computer graphics. He was able to attract Ivan Sutherland, Tom Stockham, and some other great professors to work with him.
The computer-science department went from mediocre to really, really good, practically overnight. At that point, I switched my studies from mathematics to computer science.
While still in the mathematics department, I had been doing some work for the computer center, a service center for the rest of the University, creating a student-registration system. One day at work, a student of Dave Evans came along and said, “Gee, I’m trying to solve this hidden-surface problem, can you give me any insight into this?” and I said, “Well, it seems to me the problem needs to be organized this way,” and I proceeded to get really interested in it and coded up the solution that I had in mind. My solution reduced by a large order of magnitude the amount of processing that had to go on. All of a sudden the computer-science department dragged me in and I became part of their group instantly, giving talks all across the country about my work on this hidden-surface problem and the coding solution I came up with.
Sutherland, who did Sketchpad in 1963, brought a lot of synergy and fresh ideas to this new group at Utah. This very talented group did an enormous amount of work in a very short amount of time. Ed Catmull, who later became head of Lucasfilm Ltd., and Jim Blinn, who does all the incredible Jupiter fly-bys, came out of Utah. Martin Newell, who later worked for Xerox PARC and is now at CAD Link, was there. Alan Kay, his mentor Bob Borton, and Patrick Boudelier, who did a lot of the research work at PARC, also came out of Utah. Bob Taylor was at Utah for a while, and Henry Fuchs. Most of those people were students of Dave Evans. In fact, it’s quite remarkable when you look back and realize that the work done by this small group of people at Utah made possible the use of computer graphics in films produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. at Digital Productions and in much of television advertising today.
INTERVIEWER: A lot of Dave Evans’ students went on to become systems designers. What do you think makes a good systems designer?
WARNOCK: There are very few really talented designers. Some people are very good at one particular thing or another, but systems design takes real balance, taking a list of options here and a list of options there, and combining them so they really work well together. A lot of people design an algorithm and then design the system around that algorithm.
Good systems design is much more of an engineering activity; it’s a set of trade-offs and balances among various systems’ components. I think the most difficult part of systems design is knowing how to make those trade-offs and balances among the various components.
INTERVIEWER: When did you come up with the original idea for the PostScript language?
WARNOCK: PostScript started in the Evans and Sutherland days when we were doing a harbor simulator for the Maritime Academy. We had to build a digital model of New York harbor, with 1,500 buildings and tank farms, and all the bridges and buoys and everything–all the landscape. The simulator was going to project the view of the harbor as seen from the bridge of the ship. We needed to write a huge, three-dimensional database and a lot of real-time software to make the simulator work the way they wanted it to.
We had a year to complete this massive undertaking. It was a full-color model with all three dimensions. We decided the most stupid thing we could do was to design this database in a form that would be used directly by the simulator. In other words, to bind it up too tightly. We decided to create a text file and then write a compiler to compile the text file into the form that the simulator would need (whenever we decided what that would be). We still didn’t know what the simulator was going to look like.
So we started building this huge database in text form. In digitizing the database and in building this big three-dimensional model, it became very obvious that rather than having a static data structure in the text file, it was much more reasonable to have a language. It needed to be a very simple, easily parsed, and extensible language. So that’s where the basic ideas of PostScript got started, in developing a language for this three-dimensional graphic database.
INTERVIEWER: After working with Evans and Sutherland, you went to Xerox PARC, correct? What was your experience like at Xerox PARC?
WARNOCK: Going to PARC was very interesting. I went there in 1978, and stayed about four years. There were several political factions within PARC. One was the Mesa group that previously had done BCPL. The Mesa group used traditional languages. And then there was the AI group, which used LISP.
I worked for Taylor’s lab, which was the Computer Sciences Laboratory. I prefer the LISP-style languages, because they’re more interactive and they’re interpreters; I like the interpretive environment. But it would have been political suicide to use LISP when I belonged to this group because my work would simply have been ignored.
Martin Newell and I decided to reimplement the E&S design system in Mesa. We called it JaM. Reimplementing the design system took about three months. It became an interpretive language that we could use as an experimental workbench to try out all kinds of new ideas.
After a couple of years, when the Imaging Sciences Laboratory broke away from the Computer Sciences Laboratory, JaM was used as a primary development tool. We started hooking in all the graphics procedures to drive the displays and printers. Then that basic language structure evolved into Interpress, which is Xerox’s printing protocol. This same language structure has again been implemented a third time as PostScript. They’re essentially all the same language. It’s really a ten- or eleven-year-old language that’s had a lot of proving and a lot of reimplementation ideas in the process.
INTERVIEWER: What made you focus on the PostScript text printing as- pect of the language structure?
WARNOCK: Well, first of all, the language property you want for printing is a straightforward syntax. PostScript is like FORTH because the syntax is so simple to parse. This means that if I want to communicate to another processor, all I have to do is send the serial stuff across the wire and it can be consumed by the processor on the other side in a straightforward way.
Another nice benefit of simple syntax is that other computer programs can generate new programs easier. The straightforward, simple syntax made this language structure a natural candidate for a printing protocol; if you want your printing protocol to be procedurally based, and to be a programming language as opposed to a static data structure.
Bob Sproull and William Newman at PARC developed a format, called Press Format, that consisted of static data structures. But they found that it wasn’t the most flexible way to handle printing. To add a feature, you had to essentially rebuild the system with more features in it.
We felt it was really important for the printing protocol to be extensible. So if you need more features, you can use the machinery of the language itself to build the features, as opposed to designing them from the beginning. You can’t predict what features you’ll want in the future.
So Interpress was a good candidate for a printing protocol. Chuck and I tried to get Xerox to do something reasonable with Interpress for two years, but it became clear that in the process of getting it out to consumers, they were going to destroy it. They were going to add some features and take away other features that would make it not only difficult to implement but difficult to maintain, and difficult to educate people about. We felt that if we were on our own, we could create a product in a much more straightforward and reasonable way.
Essentially, we took the original, clean design and extended it in a number of ways to make it a practical language; then we went after printing. We chose printing because all the computer companies were trying to do printer products at that time and were dumping a lot of money into research and development to get laser printers to work. But they weren’t having a great deal of success. Most of the products didn’t adapt easily.
We felt that we could effectively market PostScript to the computer companies because it was device-independent. It avoided dependencies to a specific machine, so the computer companies had the flexibility to take on new technology without having to change software. We believed this would be perceived as a great value and easy to sell, and it has been. Whereas in the screen business you’re competing against everybody else’s screen package and you have operating-systems considerations; this was a nice, clean, separate piece of business without a lot of the hassle.
INTERVIEWER: In what direction is the PostScript language still evolving?
WARNOCK: Well, for the printing application, it probably has slowed down to a crawl. Now I think it makes sense to go into the screen world and give work stations the model that the printer has. There we must adapt it considerably, because of the different requirements of the screen. The requirements are very high-speed activity for certain kinds of garbage-collecting operations, and the memory-management tasks aren’t necessarily part of the printer world. were writing that code and it’s evolving in that direction.
INTERVIEWER: Do you still write code?
WARNOCK: Oh, absolutely, almost every day. It has a great intellectual value; it’s fun.
INTERVIEWER: What kind of code do you write now?
WARNOCK: Mostly PostScript code; just making a more elaborate page than the last time, or some little utility function. I don’t do any of the serious system code around here.
I get involved a lot in the design aspects and things like that, and the general philosophy and direction, and how things should be done, but I don’t actually sit down and put pen to paper. We have people who are a lot better at it than I am; it’s much easier to get their brains to work together with mine.
INTERVIEWER: Is it easier for you to write good code today than it was back ten or twenty years ago?
WARNOCK: The tools are better. The programming environments are better. The languages are more expressive. Computers are much more powerful now than ten or twenty years ago. But there are more options available, which also means more options for many more mistakes.
INTERVIEWER: But doesn’t all of your experience make it a lot easier?
WARNOCK: Oh yes. It’s a trade-off–all of the experience for the vitality I had when I was younger. As I get older, perhaps I don’t take as many false steps, but I don’t have the strength to get up and run as hard as I used to.
INTERVIEWER: Do you approach writing code differently today? Do you have a different method? Do you plan everything out beforehand?
WARNOCK: I think a lot before I do anything, and once I do something, I’m not afraid to throw it away. It’s very important that a programmer be able to look at a piece of code like a bad chapter of a book and scrap it without looking back. Never get too enamored with one idea, never hang onto anything tenaciously without being able to throw it away when necessary; that should be the programmer’s attitude.
Also, never make an assumption that you know something somebody else doesn’t know. There will always be some smart guy who will come along and figure out a better algorithm, or figure out an easier way of performing some task. One of the tricks of the trade is to recognize this early, adopt it quickly, and exploit it without having a “not-invented-here” hangup about doing it your way.
INTERVIEWER: What makes for a good program?
WARNOCK: When you run a performance check on a good program, the performance looks flat. This tells you there are no bottlenecks in the code. The balance of the program makes it good. It’s not one particular clever trick.
I’ve been in the business since 1963, so I’ve been writing programs for more than twenty years. With lots of experience you collect hundreds of algorithms over the years; you remember tricks you’ve learned, you remember bugs you’ve had, and blind alleys you’ve gone down. You remember all the things you’ve done wrong and all the things that have worked out well. It’s a matter of picking and choosing from that smorgasbord to make a good menu, so to speak, to do a given task. You can have a great dish here and a great dish there, but together they may taste like dog food. Putting a meal together in a very delicate and sophisticated way is what makes a good cook. Putting the pieces of a program together in the same way is what makes a good computer programmer.
INTERVIEWER: How do you discern a good programmer from an ordinary programmer?
WARNOCK: It’s hard. The interview process normally doesn’t distinguish the good programmers from the bad ones. It’s like hiring a writer. You can’t tell how well someone writes simply from an interview. But if the person has written a number of prize-winning novels, you have a much better understanding of their talent. So we hire most of our people through the grapevine. When you’ve been in the business a long time, you get to know a lot of the people. You can pretty much find who you’re looking for by their reputation in the industry.
INTERVIEWER: There aren’t any set rules?
WARNOCK: I have never figured out any. The range of personalities and different kinds of talent in this business are just enormous. Some people are really good at certain kinds of programming and some people are good at other kinds. It’s like writing comedy versus writing a serious dramatic novel.
INTERVIEWER: When did you get interested in computers and computer programming?
WARNOCK: I had planned on becoming a college professor and teaching mathematics. In 1963, near the end of my graduate studies, I was looking for a summer job. It was late to be looking and the only summer job I could find was recapping tires for Firestone. Working there was hot, dirty, and incredibly noisy. After just three weeks, I said, “I have a master’s degree in mathematics; I don’t need this.”
I went to the local IBM office and applied for a job. They put me through all of their tests and then made me an offer for more money than I had ever heard of. IBM sent me to Seattle and Los Angeles for training to become a systems engineer. Then IBM gave me the two largest accounts in the Salt Lake district.
After a while I decided to leave IBM and go back to school at the University of Utah to get my doctorate in mathematics. Then I got married and needed a real job to support myself, so I worked at the computer center at the university. And that’s what led me into the computer-science field.
INTERVIEWER: If you had your education to do over again, would you concentrate in mathematics or computer science?
WARNOCK: Oh, I’ve always liked mathematics; problem solving has always been fun. My saving grace in life is that I was not introduced to computers at an early age.
INTERVIEWER: Why wouldn’t it help to learn about computers earlier?
WARNOCK: I went through the university, all the way to the master’s level, so I got a good, solid liberal education. I believe it’s really important to have a very solid foundation in mathematics, English, and the basic sciences. Then, when you become a graduate student, it’s okay to learn as much as you can about computers.
If you really want to be successful, being acculturated to the rest of the society and then going into computers is a much more reasonable way to approach the problem. I like computers because they let you realize things that you can only put on paper in mathematics. You get a tangible result. And debugging programs, actually getting them to work, is fascinating. You can finally give the machine a set of parameters and have it come out with the correct answers.
It’s just great fun; it’s very satisfying, sort of like mountain climbing. It’s like a lot of activities in life: When you’re successful at it and you finally get it to work right, it feels good and you get a big kick out of it.
INTERVIEWER: When you were working at PARC, did you ever think you would have a business like the one you have today?
WARNOCK: No. Starting the business was interesting. When we first thought about it, we thought about what the world could probably use and we concluded that we ought go into the service business. We could build electronic printers that personal computers could dial up to do the printing. Then we went to Hambrecht and Quist for venture capital, but they said the service business was no good. The service business is something venture capital people won’t talk to you about. It’s very specialized financially, and the only way you make money is through franchising it. That’s really hard unless you’re gifted at franchising, and we weren’t.
We decided we needed a more traditional business plan. We came up with creating a work station with document-preparation software, hooking laser printers and typesetters to that, and selling documentation systems. This is the same sort of business plan as ViewTech, Interleaf, XYVision and Texet-the whole list. It’s the same business plan that they’ve all had.
After three months of work and after talking with a couple of major computer companies, we decided it was a silly business plan. We would have to build a marketing distribution channel and a light-manufacturing facility. Essentially we would have to build the whole business. And we obviously had no particular expertise in that domain.
We did have expertise at building a specialized piece of software in demand by computer companies. So we switched our business plan and became an OEM supplier of software. We wouldn’t have to be in manufacturing, marketing, or distribution. And we could service the generalized computer community. It has turned out very well.
INTERVIEWER: In the future, do you see computers basically the same as they are today ? Or do you see radical changes?
WARNOCK: Considering the level of change over the past four or five years, I think it’s enormously difficult to predict. Technological growth has been spectacular in this period. For instance, five years ago 64K chips were about all you had. And now we’re talking about megabit chips, and CD ROMs. I don’t see anything to indicate that the growth is going to slow down. Today no one can say what the next innovation is going to be. The information age is just a giant feedback loop; every new tool you get helps you build another tool that’s much better. So if anything, the growth will probably be more explosive.
INTERVIEWER: What role do you think computers will play in society in the future?
WARNOCK: Computer literacy will have to become essential. People deal with computers every day and don’t realize it. There will have to be a corresponding improvement in user interfaces, so that people can deal more effectively with machines; those go hand in hand. Society is totally dependent upon technology today, and I don’t see any reason why that will ever change.
INTERVIEWER: What do you think is going to happen to the publishing industry?
WARNOCK: The publishing industry is adopting technological innovations much more rapidly than I expected. I thought this whole process would take years to mature, that it would come through a slow evolution into the use of electronic-publishing techniques. But it’s happening at an unbelievable rate.
The heavy-duty publishers are accepting the technology immediately. The Knight-Ridder chain has many laser printers and Macintosh computers. The Gannett newspaper chain has purchased a lot of laser printers. The Hearst paper chain has bought some, and recently we heard that the Associated Press is sending PostScript programs across the wire. That’s incredibly gratifying because it’s been just a few months since the laser printers entered the market. I thought that kind of acceptance would take many more years as opposed to a few months.
Many businesses are now doing their own newsletters on Macintosh computers and LaserWriter printers instead of going to traditional typesetters. People are seeing the benefit of the new technology. The office market, the traditional word-processing market, is going to move fairly quickly to the laser printers for better quality.
INTERVIEWER: How long do you think it will be before the quality of output from laser printers will be comparable to typesetters?
WARNOCK: It will be a while. Certain physical properties of toner particles and other problems make it difficult to get very high resolution. Typesetters are inherently precise devices that expose very clean edges, and it’s very hard to reproduce that.
Xerography has a basic toner particle-size problem to deal with. It works with little spots of charge, so it’s a matter of how small the charge units can be and still attract toner. The quality is good now, but if you compare pages done with typesetting and xerography under a magnifying glass, you can see that xerography can’t compare yet. Maybe some of the thermal technologies and ink-jet technologies will succeed before xerography.
Typesetters will get cheaper, and the quality of xerography will get better. Xerography will also get cheaper. You will see laser printers in the $2,000 range in a couple of years. I think typewriters using fixed-pitch fonts will be replaced by high-quality typefaces–at least that’s what I hope.
INTERVIEWER:What’s the secret of success in this industry?
WARNOCK: To be successful, you want to surround yourself with very talented folks whose skills blend very well. That’s the secret of success.
INTERVIEWER: What is your approach to programming?
WARNOCK: I don’t know if there’s a single set of things. I’ve touched on some. Don’t bind early; don’t ever make decisions earlier than you have to. Stay an order of magnitude more general than you think you need, because you will end up needing it in the long term. Get something working very quickly and then be able to throw it away.
Learn from small experiments rather than large ones. Don’t go into a two-year development with nothing coming out in the middle. Have something come out every two months, so you can evaluate, regroup, and restart.
Often programmers overdefine their approach from the beginning. They may start out with a central idea and begin coding on day one. Then they find that they have a concentric-ring approach where everything starts to grow because of the dependency on so many other factors. But if you keep the process fairly loose and free and move quickly at the end, you get a much better product in the long term.
INTERVIEWER: Why do you think you’re in software instead of hardware?
WARNOCK: It’s probably the mathematician in me; I prefer the abstract. I would rather play with ideas and combinations of ideas than combinations of objects. I was never very mechanical.
INTERVIEWER: What do you like about writing software?
WARNOCK: It’s always challenging. I look at software writing like authorship, like normal writing. You’re trying to combine ideas and concepts in a way that will make other people think, that will be new and exciting. The software business is like the publishing business. You’re trading ideas; that’s your commodity. I like it because I’m moderately good at it and I’ve had success in thinking of some new ideas along the line. That’s a great kick.
INTERVIEWER: What would you pinpoint as the new ideas you’ve thought of for software?
WARNOCK: The most obvious is the original hidden-line work I did at Utah. It was fairly original at the time, and a lot of programs have been built on top of it. I really get a kick out of solving something that looks hard, and making it look easy. That was Ivan Sutherland’s great claim to fame. He could dissect any problem, pull it apart, and make it look easy. He was very good at that kind of work.
I also enjoy having people use the things I create. I was very frustrated at Xerox because I’d see great products coming out in the marketplace and I knew that I could do the same thing. Now, to pick up a magazine and leaf through it and see pictures and advertisements clone on a LaserWriter is a great kick. I really enjoy seeing other people use the fruits of my labor. That’s the ultimate satisfaction.
INTERVIEWER: What’s your work routine? Do you work mostly at your office or home?
WARNOCK: I do work at home, but I also work at the office and travel a lot. I talk to customers and I speak at conferences. Right now my function is a combination of doing some inside work and a lot of outside work.
INTERVIEWER: Has owning your own business changed your life in a significant way?
WARNOCK: Yes. In the first year and a half I worked almost totally on development, getting everything to work. Now the project has gone into a marketing, public relations, and customer-support phase. Most of my daily activity is meeting people and dealing with corporations, talking to VPs within corporations and signing contracts. But it’s all fun. It’s a little different this year than it was last year, and last year was a little different from the year before. That’s what life’s all about.
INTERVIEWER: How many people were working on PostScript during the development period?
WARNOCK: PostScript probably took twenty man-years to develop. It’s a fairly substantial piece of code when you consider all the fonts. In the Laser-Writer, we blew half a megabyte of ROM, and none of it could be wrong. It’s all cast in concrete, going out with every machine. I think that’s one of the larger single pieces of code ever put into ROM. Getting the testing done was a shaky period around here.
INTERVIEWER: What was the biggest problem faced in the development of PostScript?
WARNOCK: As with most projects, the last 2 percent takes 50 percent of the time. Getting the code to completely hold together took a while. Then you have to be sure you can exercise it by all the communication protocols, that you can have all the interrupts and everything, and that it doesn’t break.
INTERVIEWER: Do you prefer any language in general?
WARNOCK: People around here are experienced enough so they don’t necessarily prefer one thing over another. We use whatever has the most reasonable environment and set of compilers; those are the considerations. Computer languages are computer languages. Once you’ve learned a half dozen, the next half dozen aren’t very hard to learn.
INTERVIEWER: Why do you think there are so few languages being used by designers today?
WARNOCK: There’s no motivation to have a great variety. Some people take certain design lines, as Mesa took a particular design line. But they felt that the problem was getting thirty or forty programmers to write a huge system together, so it was designed to aid in that process. If you believe good software is written that way, that might be a language you would design. But I believe good software is written by small teams of two, three, or four people interacting with each other at a very high, dense level. The best pieces of code come out of those kinds of effort. I would try to make the system so it would be impossible to get twenty people involved.
INTERVIEWER: Is that because there are too many different ideas? Or too many ways of approaching a design?
WARNOCK: There are too many styles and interfaces. I once heard that any programs you write reflect the organization in which you work. At PARC, the Computer Sciences Laboratory was an incredibly flat structure with Bob Taylor at the top. But they had to have a common tool for this diverse group, because there were about thirty people designing this one, huge, programming system. So Mesa and its programming environment modeled the way PARC worked.
Adobe was started as a very small company with about a half dozen people. The code was written by a half dozen people and the structure shows it. Certain parts belong to person X and certain parts belong to person Y, and they all have their own character and their own interfaces. On the other hand, IBM is a huge organization and their code is convoluted, with self feedbacks and different strategies that reflect separate divisions of the company. A fairly standard rule is that if you want to keep something simple, then the organization that develops it has to be simple.
INTERVIEWER: What happens when little companies grow up into huge corporations?
WARNOCK: The trick is to learn from the Hewlett-Packard approach: Keep it as twenty different, small companies. Keep breaking it up and never let it become a huge organization, except at some level that nobody cares about. In terms of working relationships, keep the number of people small and their focus localized, project-oriented, so they can work at their best. That would be my goal.
INTERVIEWER: Before computers, what did mathematicians do?
WARNOCK: A lot of mathematics! Actually, I really don’t know whether mathematics is as good as it was ten years ago. There probably has been a huge drain on the number of mathematicians in the world. It seems that some of the early theory, the best theoretical work on computers, was done in the fifties. The best mathematics of computation was done before the advent of computers. Mathematicians laid much of the groundwork of what could and couldn’t be done in computers. I don’t know if there is any good theoretical work in computing being done now. I guess there is, but there are none of the huge, major breakthroughs that occurred earlier.
INTERVIEWER: Do you consider computer science a science?
WARNOCK: No, not really. It’s more of an engineering discipline; a very good, fruitful engineering discipline. To me, science is postulating hypotheses and doing experiments to create models in the world. Computers have nothing to do with that. They are self-fulfilling prophecies about a model of the world. They’re great information tools; they’re great artifacts of the society for manipulating and controlling information. But I don’t know what truth computer science is trying to learn.

Supports K@W's Innovation Content 

John Warnock’s sense of aesthetics — his love of visual design and fine typography — is evident as soon you step inside his home. In the entryway is an elegant stone carving of the Latin alphabet. A page from an illuminated manuscript is displayed in the corner of the living room. That sense of aesthetics, combined with a strong belief “in doing things right” technically, has driven Adobe Systems — the company Warnock founded with Charles “Chuck” Geshcke — throughout much of its history. 
This passion convinced Warnock to focus on the company’s Acrobat product line even though the market initially showed little interest and Adobe’s own board of directors sought to kill the product. Warnock’s instincts proved accurate in this instance. After years of floundering, Acrobat later grew to become one of Adobe’s most profitable products. 
Yet that vision of what is technically and aesthetically “right” has also blinded the company to some of the major shifts in technology. During the rise of the web, Adobe sat on the sidelines longer than most companies partly because, as Warnock characterizes it, “early versions of HTML — from a design point of view — were awful.” 







Given these steadfast views, it is perhaps surprising that much of Adobe’s competitive strategy has long depended on a delicate balance between publicly documenting its intellectual property and gaining a competitive advantage through proprietary software. This approach has led the company to establish several of the key standards for print and interactive publishing: the PostScript printer language, Acrobat’s Portable Document Format (PDF), and the Flash format the company gained from its acquisition of Macromedia in 2005. Adobe has generated significant revenue by selling software tools to create and modify these openly published file formats. 
Knowledge@Wharton recently met with Adobe Systems co-founder and co-chairman John Warnock in his home in Los Altos, Calif., to talk about the company’s history and its business strategy, as well as topics like why he avoids using Microsoft software and why he believes Apple CEO Steve Jobs should re-engage a partnership with Adobe and make Flash available on the iPhone. An edited version of that conversation follows. 
Knowledge@Wharton: How did you first meet [Adobe co-founder] Chuck Geschke?
Warnock: I was working for [computer graphics firm] Evans & Sutherland in the Bay Area and they wanted to give me a promotion and move me back to Salt Lake [City]. My wife and I decided we didn’t want to do that. I had a friend, William Newman, at Xerox PARC [Palo Alto Research Center]. He [asked around] and Chuck’s name came up as starting a new endeavor at the PARC. So, Chuck and I met on a [job] interview.
He was about to start a lab called the Imaging Sciences Laboratory. They built the first version of a personal computer in the [Xerox] Alto and had the beginnings of graphic user interfaces. They were going to the next generation machine and all of the stuff they had done was very machine-specific. I was chartered with building the device-independent data representation for dealing with graphics.
Knowledge@Wharton: Was this for the screen or for hardcopy?
Warnock: Both. They had started using laser printers and [Xerox’s] printing protocols were not terribly flexible — they had very, very specific bitmaps [fixed resolution images] that they used for fonts. They were okay for producing letters and reports, but they could not deal with sophisticated graphics.
At Evans & Sutherland John Gaffney and I developed a language called the Design System that ran on [Digital Equipment Corp.] PDP-11s. It was an interpretive language and had the same syntax and structure that PostScript ended up having. I decided that I needed an interactive interpretive tool bench at PARC to do my experiments. So I re-implemented the Design System with Martin Newell. We added all the graphic operators so we could do graphics and test out ideas on screens and different medium. We called it JaM for “John and Martin.”
Xerox was then starting development with the Star [computer workstation] and they needed a printer protocol. I proposed using JaM as a framework for a printer protocol. We got five designers into the process: Butler Lampson, Bob Sproull, Jerry Mendelson, Chuck and myself. Over a two-year period we designed [the Xerox printer protocol] InterPress.
Knowledge@Wharton: Why did you and Geschke decide to leave Xerox PARC to form your own company?
Warnock: We sold InterPress throughout the Xerox organization for two years. They said, “Oh, we love it. We’ll make it a standard. We are going to put the locks on it and wait until all of our printers can do this before we release it.” Chuck and I found this totally unacceptable [and realized,] “That will never happen in our lifetime.”
The only way to make standards is to get them out and just compete. I went into Chuck’s office one day and said, “Chuck, we [can stay at] a very cushy, wonderful job here. Or we could try to get something done. Why don’t I get on an airplane, go talk to Dave Evans, my old thesis adviser, and get some advice from him. [Evans] introduced us to [investment banker] Bill Hambrecht who said, “Sure, let’s go for it.”
We founded Adobe on December 2, [1982] — 27 years ago.
Knowledge@Wharton: You mentioned making PostScript a standard. Was that a practical need — because you needed software to support your printer? Or was it a strategic business decision?
Warnock: We felt that if we wanted this broadly adopted that we had to do exactly the opposite of what Xerox wanted to do. We had to publish it. We had to make it very, very open — because the trick was to get both [software] application developers and operating system developers to support it. Without documentation that was never going to happen.
Knowledge@Wharton: You said that your goal was to make PostScript very, very open. There was one aspect of it that wasn’t so open: PostScript’s “Type 1” font format was initially a proprietary secret.
Warnock: Yes.
Knowledge@Wharton: What drove the decision to keep that secret — was it a requirement of your font vendors, or was it to give you a competitive edge?
Warnock: There were two major technological developments that made PostScript successful.
The first was [that] this was the first time a full programming language had been [used] to control a printer. There was a very strategic reason to do that. Most [software] application programs have their own model of how they work, and typically it’s not the way that the printer wants to work. This was true with Apple. Apple had [the Macintosh graphics system] QuickDraw, and they had their own model for how QuickDraw worked.
The strategy was to write a program that would interpret QuickDraw but load the program into the printer as a PostScript program and let the printer do the work of transforming [the QuickDraw graphics] into the image. That way, all the QuickDraw applications could work out of the gate. The same was true with some of the early word processors.
The second [technological development] was the font problem.
The highest resolution printers at that time were 300 spots to the inch. If you represented characters as outlines the obvious [way], the fonts looked terrible. The sampling artifacts [the side effects of digitization] were horrendous. We knew that no publication or office environment would live with that.
We had to solve the font problem. [Stanford University computer scientist] Don Knuth worked on it for years and years and years, trying to get good looking fonts for TeX [digital typesetting software] and he never succeeded.
I had a sort of backward idea of how to do it. If you put down the outline of the character [on a low resolution device] the rasters [the lines the device is able to render] don’t line up — you will get some staffs that are 2-pixels wide and some that are 3. It makes the fonts look horrible.
The very simple idea is: Rather than figuring out what dots to turn on, you stretch the characters so that they line up with the rasters. So if you had the left side of the [letter] ‘n’ and the right side of the ‘n’ — all you have to do is make sure that they are in phase with the frequency of the rasters and then cache that character. That guarantees that all the staffs are uniform thickness and all the x-heights hit at the right place. It turned awful looking fonts into incredible looking fonts.
We never published it because it is such a simple idea that if you applied for a patent, everyone could figure a workaround.
Knowledge@Wharton: Why not document this feature as you did the rest of the PostScript language?
Warnock: Because then everyone could do what we could do.
Knowledge@Wharton: So you saw this as a strategic advantage?
Warnock: Oh, yes. This was kept as a company trade secret [for years].
Knowledge@Wharton: Keeping it a secret worked for a while. Then, in September of 1989, two of your biggest competitors, Microsoft and Apple, teamed up to create an alternate font format — what later became TrueType — as well as market a PostScript clone printer. How did you first hear of this plan?
Warnock: It all transpired within about two weeks before [the September 1989] Seybold [conference].
We found out from Jean-Louis Gassée at Apple. Jean-Louis wanted his imprint on Apple and he wanted to remove all imprints of Steve [Jobs]. Steve was very closely associated with PostScript and the LaserWriter. In some sense, Jean-Louis wanted to reinvent all of that. From my point of view, it was totally an ego thing.
He got together with Microsoft. We talked to Bill [Gates] and said, “This is totally stupid. We will open up [the details of the font format].” Microsoft at that point perceived us as a threat. They said, “No, we’re going to compete with you.”
We essentially just out-invented them. We got ATM [Adobe Type Manager] working for screen resolutions. [PostScript’s Type 1 fonts have] always been, in my opinion, a better solution than TrueType.
At one point we had 22 PostScript competitors. There were 22 clones out there that were trying to undercut us in the market. And as far as I know, not one of them succeeded — including Microsoft’s. I think they produced exactly one printer, of which they sold zero. It was a disaster.
Knowledge@Wharton: With PostScript such a success, why did Adobe then move into desktop software?
Warnock: PostScript was an enormously profitable product. It was growing like crazy. But during its maximum growth, I said, “You know, if we don’t start doing other products, we are going to be a one-product company. We are going to diversify. As painful this is, we are going to take intellectual resources off of PostScript and put them on things like Illustrator.” So we started the Illustrator project.
Then we got approached by [John and Thomas] Knoll in 1989, and we licensed Photoshop — [which ran on a] a 512k Mac and a 20MB disk.
I knew that machines would get faster and memory would get cheaper, but I had no idea that it would go to the extent that it has. I said, “Look, I know that photography is going to become important.” So I made the decision to license Photoshop.
In the mid-1990s, the Knoll brothers said, “Photoshop is going to run out of gas.” We offered to buy it and gave them a lump sum payment to buy Photoshop. Little did they know that Photoshop would continue to blossom and grow.
Knowledge@Wharton: How did the idea for PDF [Adobe Acrobat’s Portable Document Format] emerge?


Knowledge@Wharton High School






Warnock: In the early 1990s, we were starting to use local area networks more. Sending PostScript files around was not terribly compelling. So I started to think about the problem.
There is a property of PostScript that made Acrobat possible: Every one of the operators [PostScript’s basic commands] can be redefined. If you take all the graphic operators and define them so that they output just the parameters, you get a static file of all the graphics that are in a PostScript file — but the pages have all been delimited. Everything is now a data structure as opposed to a program. In other words, we flatten out the program to make a very simple file. That program is also very, very efficient; all the computing has been distilled out of it — hence the [name of the Acrobat creation tool] “Distiller.”
I first used this trick with PostScript when Steve Jobs had this tax form that he wanted to use as a demo. It used to take two minutes to print on the classic LaserWriter because there was so much computing involved. I wrote a basic version of the Distiller in the early 1980s that would flatten the file and make it an efficient PostScript file, which got the execution down from a couple of minutes to 20 seconds. Steve was delighted, because he could now demo this thing.
I said, “Let’s take this basic idea and write out a file and see if it works on the screen with a reasonable performance.” And it did.
The piece of code that they used you would never use to build a product. We got our best architects and said, “We need to build this into a file format that really has legs under it.” If video or other media types come along, we want this format to stand the test of time and be really extensible. So we got our best engineers to design the PDF file format.
The other problem we had to solve was font substitution. We didn’t have all the licenses to ship fonts [with the electronic document]. If the receiver [of the document] didn’t have the right font, you still wanted the layout to be exactly right. So I invented a variation of the type solution so that you could vary the widths of the typefaces with these specially designed fonts to make substitution fonts. If I had Times Roman I could import the widths table of Times Roman and generate characters so that they would fit exactly the same way Times Roman did. We put that into the early versions of PDF.
Knowledge@Wharton: Acrobat didn’t take off at first.
Warnock: When Acrobat was announced, the world didn’t get it. They didn’t understand how important sending documents around electronically was going to be.
We met with [someone from] the Gartner Group, who said, “This is the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard in my life.” But I said, “No, people have been trying to figure out universal document formats for decades, and no one has succeeded. The reason we can succeed is that we don’t have to ask anybody’s permission. No one has to do any development. We can capture the PostScript files and convert any PostScript file into a PDF file. And no one has to say this is a good idea or a bad idea. We can just make it a fait accompli.”
When I described Acrobat to IBM executives, I said, “There is a trick you can use to capture all the printout and make it into a device independent thing that you can ship around networks.” They absolutely didn’t get it.
They were into [the semantic markup languages] SGML and XML and those levels of abstraction. In some sense, the Gartner Group was in the SGML world [where] you need to have this differentiation between the rendition and the semantic intent. I said, “It’s easy to add that afterwards if you have the page. It is much easier to start with something that actually works, and back out into the applications, than it is to get applications to change.”
Knowledge@Wharton: In some ways that tension between presentation and structure persisted throughout much of Adobe’s history.
Warnock: Absolutely. And that was a battle that I was always happy to take on.
Knowledge@Wharton: Despite this sluggish start, you continued to support Acrobat.
Warnock: [Adobe’s] board wanted to kill it. I said, “There’s just no way. This is solving an important problem, and we are going to hang in there until it works.”
Knowledge@Wharton: Acrobat Reader 1.0 cost between $35 and $50 a seat depending on volume. By version 2, it was free. Was that a difficult choice to make inside the company?
Warnock: Very risky choice — because we then had to rely on the creation process for any revenue stream. But it was the right decision.
Knowledge@Wharton: Around this time, the web started to take off. Adobe took a while to get on board with the rise of the web. Why do you think that was?
Warnock: We had a lot invested in doing things right. The early versions of HTML — from a design point of view — were awful. There was nothing beautiful about it. You had different browsers [that displayed web pages differently]. Adobe always prided itself on making software that ran the same way on a PC, the Mac or any other operating system.
We didn’t plunge into: “Well, here is what the web is — let’s just go get it.” [Instead,] we were always searching for: “How can we do this right? How can we build a better infrastructure?”
Knowledge@Wharton: Shortly afterwards, you made a couple of major acquisitions with Aldus and later FrameMaker. What drove those?
Warnock: In the case of Aldus, it was just getting a jumpstart into document production. In the case with FrameMaker, the FrameMaker architecture was infinitely better — infinitely better — than the Aldus architecture. I could never get anybody except the ex-Frame employees at Adobe to understand that the architecture was fundamentally more sound in FrameMaker than in Aldus. The Aldus side won, essentially, with [the development of Adobe’s page layout product] InDesign. We’re still trying to catch up to FrameMaker.
Knowledge@Wharton: In the summer of 1998 when most technology companies were booming, Adobe went through a difficult period. Your sales stalled, your stock price slumped, and one of your major competitors — Quark — tried to acquire you. What happened?
Warnock: I think the cause was we didn’t have a good story on the web. Our customers and everybody wondered what the relationship of Adobe was going to be with the web. We really didn’t have our act together.
Unfortunately, Chuck and I had talked about: “At some point we have to retire, so we should hire some management that could be potential successors” — which was the worst decision. It was the stupidest thing.
We had an executive team that wouldn’t work together. No matter how many times we pounded the table saying, “You have to cooperate,” they built their little political silos and power empires within their own groups.
We had to fire the whole bunch of them. At one point, we fired everybody. We promoted Bruce [Chizen]. We said, “Look, we just have to have a whole different view of how we interact with [Wall Street], how we interact with each other. We have to be perfectly candid about what we are going to accomplish and do it — and announce it to the street ahead of time.”
We changed our strategy. We said [what we were we were going to do] over the next year and we executed on it. The company completely changed. Bruce was very, very good. He had come up inside of Adobe and he was very good at working with the various groups. We essentially cleaned house.
Knowledge@Wharton: What drove your decision to step down from the CEO role in 2001?
Warnock: Bruce [Chizen] was a very strong candidate. I was getting on. I had to retire at some point. I wanted to travel and enjoy some of the success and do other things.
Being a CEO of a company that is over $1 billion is not all it is cracked up to be.
The thing I really enjoy is the invention process. I enjoy figuring out how to do things other people don’t know how to do. [As CEO,] you’re dealing with employment suits and with reporting to the IRS and the early parts of Sarbanes-Oxley. And, you know, life is too short.
Knowledge@Wharton: How actively involved were you in the acquisition of Macromedia in 2005?
Warnock: Bruce really wanted to do that. He saw a strategic fit, and I concurred. It was really one of the best acquisitions we have done. We got in the process [Adobe chief technology officer] Kevin Lynch, who is a pure inventor — great guy, very visionary.
Knowledge@Wharton: Adobe has now introduced cloud-based services such as BuzzWord and Photoshop.com, which are available for free. What motivated these?
Warnock: The monetization strategy is changing.
For the longest time, you tried to get Adobe to look at different business models. Getting companies to change when they know how to do something really well [is difficult]. Adobe was sort of a well-oiled machine in this software arena. And getting them to think about doing business differently [was challenging]
We have a saying around Adobe that the antibodies will kill off any new idea. Companies build antibodies. They build resistance to change. They get comfort zones where they want to work, and employees don’t want to try something new for fear that they are going to fail. So they reject ideas.
One of the hardest things about keeping a company innovative is killing off the antibodies and forcing change.
Knowledge@Wharton: Speaking of change, it was reported that you were actively involved in the recent Omniture acquisition.
Warnock: Yes. We tracked it, and Chuck and I met with Josh [James], who was head of Omniture.
I use the web. I use all the products everyday. I build websites. I try things from Google [like] AdSense. I try to look at the world from a customer point of view, [in terms] of what you need to solve your problems. Most of the time, there isn’t something out there. So this is a market opportunity.
Knowledge@Wharton: What problem is Omniture solving?
Warnock: When you have a website, one of the things you really want to know is how people interact with that website. Where do they go? What do they find interesting? What gets them from one point to another?
Adobe now makes almost all the tools everybody uses to build their websites. If in that website building process you got automatic tooling for measuring things, then you could find out all of the interactions that people have with the website. If they are changing the color of a T-shirt, do they change it more to orange or do they change it more to navy blue? What do they do when they interact with the images? You want to know that information because that makes you figure out better products.
Knowledge@Wharton: Over the years, Adobe’s strategy seems to be trying to strike a balance between open source initiatives and proprietary software. Adobe has a history of being somewhere in the middle by having open file formats around which you develop proprietary software.
Warnock: Yes.
Knowledge@Wharton: Was this a conscious choice?
Warnock: It was a conscious choice. I guess we were egoistic enough to believe that we knew how to implement things better than other people.
Adobe has [participated] in standards bodies. Standards bodies are horrible, horrible, horrible things. They design by committee. The things that come out of them are a hodgepodge of stuff. If you look at HTML — oh, man!
Knowledge@Wharton: Over the years, Microsoft has been a frequent and intense competitor of yours. But in most markets it hasn’t succeeded.
Warnock: No.
Knowledge@Wharton: Why not?
Warnock: You know, I’ve always believed that Microsoft has never had good taste. I try to avoid using their software whenever possible because I find it jarring to the sensibilities.
Knowledge@Wharton: And you think that has hurt them competitively?
Warnock: Yes. They have attempted in their ads to represent [themselves as] cool, but they aren’t. It’s just not cool stuff.
Knowledge@Wharton: Have you looked at [Microsoft’s] Silverlight and how it compares to Flash?
Warnock: Yes, we looked at Silverlight. On paper it looked like it would probably be a competitive threat, but I don’t think they have executed well.
Flash now finally has topography in it. It’s got all the things that now make it a real Adobe product that has the depth that it needs.
And I think the new strategy with AIR [the Adobe Integrated Runtime cross-platform software application platform] is right on. Cloud computing is fine — except if you are dealing with large stuff and with compute-intensive things like graphics. AIR gives you an application that is on your desktop, but it has full access to the web and full access to the file system — which is actually the best of all possible worlds, in my opinion.
Knowledge@Wharton: Another company that you have interacted with a long time is Apple. That relationship seems to have ebbed and flowed over the years. They were originally a very close partner — one of your first OEMs [original equipment manufacturers].
Warnock: Yes.
Knowledge@Wharton: But now there is a lot of contention around getting Flash on the iPhone.
Warnock: Oh, yes.
Knowledge@Wharton: Have you talked to Steve Jobs about that?
Warnock: No, I haven’t.
Knowledge@Wharton: Have you thought about calling him?
Warnock: I’ve thought about calling him and saying, “Steve, you know, at this point you want might to engage the partnership again.” Because I think otherwise he is going to get some competitive pressures from outside that he is not going to like.
He has never been great at hitting that middle ground [between] openness and proprietary [products]. He has always seemed to lean to the proprietary side, to want to own everything. I think this is one case where he probably would do better if he didn’t do that.
Knowledge@Wharton: Yet the vertical integration between the iPhone, the Mac and the iTunes Store has been key to Apple’s success. But you think that, long term, that will run out of steam?
Warnock: Well, he will keep inventing. Steve is great. Steve is one of the truly great innovators who sees a path, goes to the path, and does it with great taste. I love his phone.
Knowledge@Wharton: But you would love it more if it had Flash?
Warnock: Well, you could go to more websites and you could do more things. And he could get more applications — not that he needs them.
Knowledge@Wharton: Looking back over your entire career, what are you most proud of?
Warnock: From a technical side — PostScript and Acrobat.
Knowledge@Wharton: What surprised you most about the evolution of these technologies — PostScript and PDF?
Warnock: The fact that there was this whole cult group that fell in love with PostScript and making PostScript programs. That was a little surprising. It’s a “write once” language. It’s not terribly self-documenting. It is very hard to figure out what is going on.
Knowledge@Wharton: Is there anything you would do differently if you could?
Warnock: I think if we did anything differently we would have missed one of those magic paths. And from a stock point of view, Adobe is the most successful stock I have ever owned. I don’t know that I would have done anything differently.
I wish I would have had some of the insight about where you find people to manage your company. I wish I had that insight earlier.
Knowledge@Wharton: Now that you’ve stepped down from the CEO role, how do you spend your time?
Warnock: I am on the boards of little companies, trying to help them. I’m programming. And I build websites. I try to do things with the products that nobody has done before.
Knowledge@Wharton: Some of the boards you have been on are publishing and media companies: Knight-Ridder, Salon, the American Film Institute and Sundance.
Warnock: I wanted to find out about the media space so I joined the Knight-Ridder board to find out how that works, how they see the world. I joined the American Film Institute and Sundance to try to understand the world of the movies.
Knowledge@Wharton: These are areas facing a number of difficulties.
Warnock: At the first board meeting at Knight-Ridder, I said, “You guys need to decide whether you are in the communication business or in the newspaper business.” And I said, “If you decide that you are in the newspaper business, you’re toast.”
Knowledge@Wharton: What does it mean for them to be a communications company versus a newspaper company?
Warnock: It means that they are doing the same thing but they have to go through a drastic monetary model change, a drastic business model change.
Newspapers and magazines are capital-intensive businesses that buy a lot of newsprint, buy a lot of paper, buy a lot of presses. Those big capital investments protected them from competition. In the world of the Internet, that is not what protects you from competition. Being light on your feet, being innovative, being new into a space is what is going to win, because the whole economic model is gone.
Knowledge@Wharton: The fear is there is no economic model on the other side of the fence, either.
Warnock: But, you know, at some point you have to make a leap of faith that either there is one, or you are going to be out of business no matter what. You can’t cling to the past.

Life and career[edit]
Warnock was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. He failed mathematics in ninth grade but graduated from Olympus High School in 1958.[1] He currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is married and has three children. Warnock has a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Philosophy, a Master of Science in Mathematics, a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Computer Science), and an honorary degree in Science, all from the University of Utah. At the University of Utah he was a member of the Gamma Beta Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.[2] He also has an honorary degree from the American Film Institute.
Warnock's earliest publication and subject of his master's thesis, was his 1964 proof of a theorem solving the Jacobson radical for row-finite matrices,[3] which was originally posed by the American mathematician Nathan Jacobson in 1956.
In 1976, while Warnock worked at Evans & Sutherland, a Salt Lake City-based computer graphics company, the concepts of the PostScript language were seeded. Prior to co-founding Adobe, with Geschke and Putman, Warnock worked with Geschke at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC), where he had started in 1978. Unable to convince Xerox management of the approach to commercialize the InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, he, together with Geschke and Putman, left Xerox to start Adobe in 1982. At their new company, they developed an equivalent technology, PostScript, from scratch, and brought it to market for Apple's LaserWriter in 1985.
In his 1969 doctoral thesis, Warnock invented the Warnock algorithm for hidden surface determination in computer graphics.[4] It works by recursive subdivision of a scene until areas are obtained that are trivial to compute. It solves the problem of rendering a complicated image by avoiding the problem. If the scene is simple enough to compute then it is rendered; otherwise it is divided into smaller parts and the process is repeated.[5] Warnock notes that for this work he received "the dubious distinction of having written the shortest doctoral thesis in University of Utah history".[1]
In the Spring of 1991, Warnock outlined a system called "Camelot",[6] that evolved into the Portable Document Format (PDF) file-format. The goal of Camelot was to "effectively capture documents from any application, send electronic versions of these documents anywhere, and view and print these documents on any machines". Warnock's document contemplated, "Imagine if the IPS (Interchange PostScript) viewer is also equipped with text searching capabilities. In this case the user could find all documents that contain a certain word or phrase, and then view that word or phrase in context within the document. Entire libraries could be archived in electronic form..."
One of Adobe's popular typefaces, Warnock, is named after him.
Adobe's PostScript technology made it easier to print text and images from a computer, revolutionizing media and publishing in the 1980s.
In 2003 Warnock and his wife donated 200,000 shares of Adobe Systems valued at over 5.7 million dollars[7] to the University of Utah as the main gift for a new engineering building. The John E. and Marva M. Warnock Engineering Building was completed in 2007 and houses the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and the Dean of the University of Utah College of Engineering.
Dr. Warnock holds seven patents. In addition to Adobe Systems, he serves or has served on the board of directors at ebrary, Knight-Ridder, MongoNet, Netscape Communications and Salon Media Group. Warnock is a past Chairman of the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the American Film Institute and the Sundance Institute.
Hobbies include photography, skiing, Web development, painting, hiking, curation of rare scientific books and historical Native American objects.[8]
A strong supporter of higher education, Warnock and his wife, Marva, have supported three presidential endowed chairs in computer science, mathematics and fine arts at the University of Utah and also an endowed chair in medical research at Stanford University.
Recognition[edit]
The recipient of numerous scientific and technical awards, Warnock won the Software Systems Award from the Association for Computing Machinery in 1989.[9] In 1995 Warnock received the University of Utah Distinguished Alumnus Award and in 1999 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Warnock was awarded the Edwin H. Land Medal from the Optical Society of America in 2000.[10] In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for "his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing."[11] Oxford University's Bodleian Library bestowed the Bodley Medal on Warnock in November, 2003.[12] [13] In 2004, Warnock received the Lovelace Medal from the British Computer Society in London.[14] In October 2006, Warnock—along with Adobe co-founder Charles Geschke—received the American Electronics Association's Annual Medal of Achievement Award, being the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008, Warnock and Geschke received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society "for inventing PostScript and PDF and helping to launch the desktop publishing revolution and change the way people engage with information and entertainment".[15] In September 2009, Warnock and Geschke were chosen to receive the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, one of the nation's highest honors bestowed on scientists, engineers and inventors.[16][17] In 2010, Warnock and Geschke received the Marconi Prize, considered the highest honor specifically for contributions to information science and communications.[18]
Warnock is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, the latter being America's oldest learned society.
He has received Honorary Degrees from the University of Utah, American Film Institute and The University of Nottingham, UK.[19]

John Edward Warnock (born October 6, 1940) is an American computer scientist and businessman best known as the co-founder with Charles Geschke of Adobe Systems Inc., the graphics and publishing software company. Warnock was President of Adobe for his first two years and Chairman and CEO for his remaining sixteen years at the company. Although retired as CEO in 2000, he still co-chairs the board with Geschke. Warnock has pioneered the development of graphics, publishing, Web and electronic document technologies that have revolutionized the field of publishing and visual communications.

Life and career[edit]
Warnock was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. He failed mathematics in ninth grade but graduated from Olympus High School in 1958.[1] He currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is married and has three children. Warnock has a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Philosophy, a Master of Science in Mathematics, a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Computer Science), and an honorary degree in Science, all from the University of Utah. At the University of Utah he was a member of the Gamma Beta Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.[2] He also has an honorary degree from the American Film Institute.
Warnock's earliest publication and subject of his master's thesis, was his 1964 proof of a theorem solving the Jacobson radical for row-finite matrices,[3] which was originally posed by the American mathematician Nathan Jacobson in 1956.
In 1976, while Warnock worked at Evans & Sutherland, a Salt Lake City-based computer graphics company, the concepts of the PostScript language were seeded. Prior to co-founding Adobe, with Geschke and Putman, Warnock worked with Geschke at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC), where he had started in 1978. Unable to convince Xerox management of the approach to commercialize the InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, he, together with Geschke and Putman, left Xerox to start Adobe in 1982. At their new company, they developed an equivalent technology, PostScript, from scratch, and brought it to market for Apple's LaserWriter in 1985.
In his 1969 doctoral thesis, Warnock invented the Warnock algorithm for hidden surface determination in computer graphics.[4] It works by recursive subdivision of a scene until areas are obtained that are trivial to compute. It solves the problem of rendering a complicated image by avoiding the problem. If the scene is simple enough to compute then it is rendered; otherwise it is divided into smaller parts and the process is repeated.[5] Warnock notes that for this work he received "the dubious distinction of having written the shortest doctoral thesis in University of Utah history".[1]
In the Spring of 1991, Warnock outlined a system called "Camelot",[6] that evolved into the Portable Document Format (PDF) file-format. The goal of Camelot was to "effectively capture documents from any application, send electronic versions of these documents anywhere, and view and print these documents on any machines". Warnock's document contemplated, "Imagine if the IPS (Interchange PostScript) viewer is also equipped with text searching capabilities. In this case the user could find all documents that contain a certain word or phrase, and then view that word or phrase in context within the document. Entire libraries could be archived in electronic form..."
One of Adobe's popular typefaces, Warnock, is named after him.
Adobe's PostScript technology made it easier to print text and images from a computer, revolutionizing media and publishing in the 1980s.
In 2003 Warnock and his wife donated 200,000 shares of Adobe Systems valued at over 5.7 million dollars[7] to the University of Utah as the main gift for a new engineering building. The John E. and Marva M. Warnock Engineering Building was completed in 2007 and houses the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and the Dean of the University of Utah College of Engineering.
Dr. Warnock holds seven patents. In addition to Adobe Systems, he serves or has served on the board of directors at ebrary, Knight-Ridder, MongoNet, Netscape Communications and Salon Media Group. Warnock is a past Chairman of the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the American Film Institute and the Sundance Institute.
Hobbies include photography, skiing, Web development, painting, hiking, curation of rare scientific books and historical Native American objects.[8]
A strong supporter of higher education, Warnock and his wife, Marva, have supported three presidential endowed chairs in computer science, mathematics and fine arts at the University of Utah and also an endowed chair in medical research at Stanford University.
Recognition[edit]
The recipient of numerous scientific and technical awards, Warnock won the Software Systems Award from the Association for Computing Machinery in 1989.[9] In 1995 Warnock received the University of Utah Distinguished Alumnus Award and in 1999 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Warnock was awarded the Edwin H. Land Medal from the Optical Society of America in 2000.[10] In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for "his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing."[11] Oxford University's Bodleian Library bestowed the Bodley Medal on Warnock in November, 2003.[12] [13] In 2004, Warnock received the Lovelace Medal from the British Computer Society in London.[14] In October 2006, Warnock—along with Adobe co-founder Charles Geschke—received the American Electronics Association's Annual Medal of Achievement Award, being the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008, Warnock and Geschke received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society "for inventing PostScript and PDF and helping to launch the desktop publishing revolution and change the way people engage with information and entertainment".[15] In September 2009, Warnock and Geschke were chosen to receive the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, one of the nation's highest honors bestowed on scientists, engineers and inventors.[16][17] In 2010, Warnock and Geschke received the Marconi Prize, considered the highest honor specifically for contributions to information science and communications.[18]
Warnock is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, the latter being America's oldest learned society.
He has received Honorary Degrees from the University of Utah, American Film Institute and The University of Nottingham, UK.[19]

Life and career[edit]
Warnock was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. He failed mathematics in ninth grade but graduated from Olympus High School in 1958.[1] He currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is married and has three children. Warnock has a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Philosophy, a Master of Science in Mathematics, a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Computer Science), and an honorary degree in Science, all from the University of Utah. At the University of Utah he was a member of the Gamma Beta Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.[2] He also has an honorary degree from the American Film Institute.
Warnock's earliest publication and subject of his master's thesis, was his 1964 proof of a theorem solving the Jacobson radical for row-finite matrices,[3] which was originally posed by the American mathematician Nathan Jacobson in 1956.
In 1976, while Warnock worked at Evans & Sutherland, a Salt Lake City-based computer graphics company, the concepts of the PostScript language were seeded. Prior to co-founding Adobe, with Geschke and Putman, Warnock worked with Geschke at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC), where he had started in 1978. Unable to convince Xerox management of the approach to commercialize the InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, he, together with Geschke and Putman, left Xerox to start Adobe in 1982. At their new company, they developed an equivalent technology, PostScript, from scratch, and brought it to market for Apple's LaserWriter in 1985.
In his 1969 doctoral thesis, Warnock invented the Warnock algorithm for hidden surface determination in computer graphics.[4] It works by recursive subdivision of a scene until areas are obtained that are trivial to compute. It solves the problem of rendering a complicated image by avoiding the problem. If the scene is simple enough to compute then it is rendered; otherwise it is divided into smaller parts and the process is repeated.[5] Warnock notes that for this work he received "the dubious distinction of having written the shortest doctoral thesis in University of Utah history".[1]

One of Adobe's popular typefaces, Warnock, is named after him.
Adobe's PostScript technology made it easier to print text and images from a computer, revolutionizing media and publishing in the 1980s.
In 2003 Warnock and his wife donated 200,000 shares of Adobe Systems valued at over 5.7 million dollars[7] to the University of Utah as the main gift for a new engineering building. The John E. and Marva M. Warnock Engineering Building was completed in 2007 and houses the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and the Dean of the University of Utah College of Engineering.
Dr. Warnock holds seven patents. In addition to Adobe Systems, he serves or has served on the board of directors at ebrary, Knight-Ridder, MongoNet, Netscape Communications and Salon Media Group. Warnock is a past Chairman of the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the American Film Institute and the Sundance Institute.
Hobbies include photography, skiing, Web development, painting, hiking, curation of rare scientific books and historical Native American objects.[8]
A strong supporter of higher education, Warnock and his wife, Marva, have supported three presidential endowed chairs in computer science, mathematics and fine arts at the University of Utah and also an endowed chair in medical research at Stanford University.

John Edward Warnock (born October 6, 1940) is an American computer scientist and businessman best known as the co-founder with Charles Geschke of Adobe Systems Inc., the graphics and publishing software company. Warnock was President of Adobe for his first two years and Chairman and CEO for his remaining sixteen years at the company. Although retired as CEO in 2000, he still co-chairs the board with Geschke. Warnock has pioneered the development of graphics, publishing, Web and electronic document technologies that have revolutionized the field of publishing and visual communications.

Life and career[edit]
Warnock was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. He failed mathematics in ninth grade but graduated from Olympus High School in 1958.[1] He currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is married and has three children. Warnock has a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Philosophy, a Master of Science in Mathematics, a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Computer Science), and an honorary degree in Science, all from the University of Utah. At the University of Utah he was a member of the Gamma Beta Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.[2] He also has an honorary degree from the American Film Institute.
Warnock's earliest publication and subject of his master's thesis, was his 1964 proof of a theorem solving the Jacobson radical for row-finite matrices,[3] which was originally posed by the American mathematician Nathan Jacobson in 1956.
In 1976, while Warnock worked at Evans & Sutherland, a Salt Lake City-based computer graphics company, the concepts of the PostScript language were seeded. Prior to co-founding Adobe, with Geschke and Putman, Warnock worked with Geschke at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC), where he had started in 1978. Unable to convince Xerox management of the approach to commercialize the InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, he, together with Geschke and Putman, left Xerox to start Adobe in 1982. At their new company, they developed an equivalent technology, PostScript, from scratch, and brought it to market for Apple's LaserWriter in 1985.
In his 1969 doctoral thesis, Warnock invented the Warnock algorithm for hidden surface determination in computer graphics.[4] It works by recursive subdivision of a scene until areas are obtained that are trivial to compute. It solves the problem of rendering a complicated image by avoiding the problem. If the scene is simple enough to compute then it is rendered; otherwise it is divided into smaller parts and the process is repeated.[5] Warnock notes that for this work he received "the dubious distinction of having written the shortest doctoral thesis in University of Utah history".[1]
In the Spring of 1991, Warnock outlined a system called "Camelot",[6] that evolved into the Portable Document Format (PDF) file-format. The goal of Camelot was to "effectively capture documents from any application, send electronic versions of these documents anywhere, and view and print these documents on any machines". Warnock's document contemplated, "Imagine if the IPS (Interchange PostScript) viewer is also equipped with text searching capabilities. In this case the user could find all documents that contain a certain word or phrase, and then view that word or phrase in context within the document. Entire libraries could be archived in electronic form..."
One of Adobe's popular typefaces, Warnock, is named after him.
Adobe's PostScript technology made it easier to print text and images from a computer, revolutionizing media and publishing in the 1980s.
In 2003 Warnock and his wife donated 200,000 shares of Adobe Systems valued at over 5.7 million dollars[7] to the University of Utah as the main gift for a new engineering building. The John E. and Marva M. Warnock Engineering Building was completed in 2007 and houses the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and the Dean of the University of Utah College of Engineering.
Dr. Warnock holds seven patents. In addition to Adobe Systems, he serves or has served on the board of directors at ebrary, Knight-Ridder, MongoNet, Netscape Communications and Salon Media Group. Warnock is a past Chairman of the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the American Film Institute and the Sundance Institute.
Hobbies include photography, skiing, Web development, painting, hiking, curation of rare scientific books and historical Native American objects.[8]
A strong supporter of higher education, Warnock and his wife, Marva, have supported three presidential endowed chairs in computer science, mathematics and fine arts at the University of Utah and also an endowed chair in medical research at Stanford University.
Recognition[edit]
The recipient of numerous scientific and technical awards, Warnock won the Software Systems Award from the Association for Computing Machinery in 1989.[9] In 1995 Warnock received the University of Utah Distinguished Alumnus Award and in 1999 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Warnock was awarded the Edwin H. Land Medal from the Optical Society of America in 2000.[10] In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for "his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing."[11] Oxford University's Bodleian Library bestowed the Bodley Medal on Warnock in November, 2003.[12] [13] In 2004, Warnock received the Lovelace Medal from the British Computer Society in London.[14] In October 2006, Warnock—along with Adobe co-founder Charles Geschke—received the American Electronics Association's Annual Medal of Achievement Award, being the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008, Warnock and Geschke received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society "for inventing PostScript and PDF and helping to launch the desktop publishing revolution and change the way people engage with information and entertainment".[15] In September 2009, Warnock and Geschke were chosen to receive the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, one of the nation's highest honors bestowed on scientists, engineers and inventors.[16][17] In 2010, Warnock and Geschke received the Marconi Prize, considered the highest honor specifically for contributions to information science and communications.[18]
Warnock is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, the latter being America's oldest learned society.
He has received Honorary Degrees from the University of Utah, American Film Institute and The University of Nottingham, UK.[19]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
