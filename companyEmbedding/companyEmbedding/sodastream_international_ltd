SodaStream International Ltd. (NASDAQ: SODA) is an Israeli drinks company best known as the maker of the consumer home carbonation product of the same name.[2][3] The device, like a soda syphon, carbonates water by adding carbon dioxide from a pressurized cylinder to create soda water (or carbonated water) to drink. The company also sells more than 100 types of concentrated syrups and flavourings to make carbonated drinks.[4][5][6]
The company was founded in 1903 in England. After the company merged with Soda-Club in 1998, it was relaunched with an emphasis on healthier drinks. It went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010. SodaStream is headquartered in Lod, Israel[7] and has 13 production plants.
Until 2015 its principal manufacturing facility was located in the Mishor Adumim industrial park in the West Bank, creating controversy and a boycott campaign.[8][9][10] In October 2015, SodaStream closed its factory in Ma'ale Adumim, and moved to a new facility in Lehavim,[11] laying off more than 500 Palestinian workers.[12] While SodaStream tried to retain some of its Palestinian employees, the Israeli government denied them permits.[13]

Product[edit]
The SodaStream drinksmaker is a device that forces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas (stored under pressure in a cylinder) into water, making it fizzy. The product includes a machine, a carbon dioxide cylinder, and one or more reusable beverage bottles. The bottle, filled with water, is threaded onto the machine, and with a button push or two, compressed CO2 from the cylinder is injected, creating carbonated water. Varieties of concentrated syrups are available, to create regular or diet soft drinks by adding a small amount of concentrate to the bottle after carbonation.
Different flavours are created by adding fruit-flavoured concentrates. During its heyday, several famous brands were available in SodaStream concentrate form including Tizer, Fanta, Sunkist and Irn-Bru.[14] SodaStream also offers diet concentrates sweetened with Splenda, and is used as much for plain sparkling water as for soft drinks. SodaStream and Kraft Foods entered into a partnership in January 2012 involving the use of the Crystal Light and Country Time brand flavours with the SodaStream home carbonation system. In July of the same year, the two companies expanded their partnership to include the Kool-Aid flavour line.[15] In 2013, SodaStream partnered with Ocean Spray to market three Ocean Spray flavours for use with the SodaStream home soda maker.[16]
In February 2013, SodaStream and Samsung announced that Samsung refrigerators with built-in SodaStream sparkling water dispensers would be available in the United States beginning in April.[17][18]
Excluding the purchase price of the machine, typical cost to the end user (2015, United States dollars) is 25 cents per litre of carbonated water generated[20] plus another 50 cents per litre for the soda syrup.[22] Pricing in other countries may vary.
This often renders SodaStream drinks more expensive than pre-mixed store brand colas,[24] presumably due to the price of soda syrup in small retail quantities.
History[edit]
The forerunner of the machine, the "Apparatus for aerating liquids",[25] was created in 1903 by Guy Hugh Gilbey of the London gin distillers, W & A Gilbey Ltd.,[14] and was sold to the upper classes (including the royal household).[5] Flavoured concentrates such as cherry ciderette and sarsaparilla, were introduced in the 1920s, along with commercial carbonation machines,[3][5] and the first machine for home carbonation of drinks was produced in 1955.[14] The SodaStream was originally sold in the UK, and later spread to other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.
SodaStream machines were popular during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK, and are associated with nostalgia for that period.[5][6] Their slogan, "Get busy with the fizzy", started as an advertising jingle in 1979 and proved so popular that they added it to their logo. The slogan was initially dropped in 1996 after 17 years,[26] but was reinstated in 2010 along with a new marketing campaign in the UK.[27]
In 1985, after various changes of ownership, SodaStream became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes, although it operated as an autonomous business within the group.[14] In 1998, SodaStream was bought by Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh, who from 1978 to 1991 had been Israel's exclusive distributor for SodaStream, creating the world's largest home carbonation systems supplier.[3][28] In 2003 Soda-Club closed the SodaStream factory in Peterborough, moving the company's gas cylinder refilling and refurbishment department to Germany.[29] Under the ownership of Soda-Club, the brand has been relaunched in many markets, with new machines and new flavours available in 41 countries.[30] In 2012, SodaStream teamed with Yves Béhar to introduce SodaStream Source, a line of soda machines designed with a special emphasis on sustainability.[31][32] Béhar's design earned SodaStream a Good Housekeeping Institute seal of approval in 2013.[33]
2010 NASDAQ IPO[edit]
SodaStream International Ltd. went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010.[34] The stock offering was jointly led by J.P. Morgan Securities and Deutsche Bank Securities.[35] At the time, the IPO was the eighth largest for an Israeli company on the NASDAQ[36] and during the year 2010 one of the top-performing IPOs generally.[37][38] To celebrate SodaStream's listing on the NASDAQ, CEO Daniel Birnbaum was invited to ring the exchange's closing bell on 3 November 2010.[39] By August 2011, SodaStream's market cap had risen from $367 million to $1.46 billion.[40][41] During 2012, the stock experienced aggressive growth, with earnings per share growing 57%. In June 2013, Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist incorrectly predicted a $2 billion Pepsi takeover of SodaStream, sending SODA stock higher before the rumours were promptly debunked by PepsiCo.[42]
Analysts had expected another 27% growth in 2013 with earnings projected to grow 30% over the next 5 years.[43] 2013's actual net earnings were down relative to 2012 despite an increase in sales; in 2014, the company's stock dropped to its lowest value since 2012. Barclays PLC analyst David Kaplan cited U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's warnings about the economic effects of boycotts and the company's failure to clarify the reasons for missed earning targets as causes for the drop.[44]
In October 2014, SodaStream announced its revenue for 2014 was expected to decline to $562.7 million, a 9% decrease from the previous year while a report by Zacks Equity Research stated that net income for 2014 is expected to be 42% lower than in 2013. Zacks Equity Research cited declining sales in the United States, where an increasing number of consumers are choosing "more natural, less caloric and water based beverages" as opposed to traditional carbonated soft drinks.
Sales[edit]
Some 20% of households in Sweden owned SodaStream machines as of 2010.[45] In January 2011, the company marked the sale of its millionth soda maker in the country.[46] Europe accounts for 52% of SodaStream's sales.[47]
SodaStream has been a publicly traded company since 2010.[48] Since May 2012, SodaStream has been sold in over 2,900 Walmart locations in the United States. In June equity research firm Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. stated that SodaStream's machines were selling out at Walmart.[49][50] SodaStream's U.S. sales grew from US$4.4 million in 2007 to $40 million in 2011.[51] Despite record sales, profit margins are declining. SodaStream's estimated 2013 net income ($41.5 million on an annual revenue of $562 million in 2013, compared to 2012's $43.86 million of net income on $436.32 million of revenue) fell short of targets and investor expectations.[52] Sodastream also sells its product at most Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Gas canisters[edit]
The SodaStream counter-top beverage carbonators are typically bundled with a 14.5 ounce proprietary CO2 cylinder, which the company claims to be able to carbonate 60 litres (13 imp gal; 16 US gal) of water. A few selected models can also accept a 33-ounce cylinder advertised as carbonating 130 litres (29 imp gal; 34 US gal) of water. According to the company, when a cylinder is empty, it must be returned to a SodaStream reseller for replacement, however there are ample videos and descriptions online of methods whereby consumers learn how to refill the canisters on their own.[53]
SodaStream does not sell the CO2 canisters to consumers, but instead "licenses" them and expressly limits how they can be used in their User License Certificate.[54] Local CO2 vendors are generally not permitted to refill Sodastream canisters ("carbonators"), which include a proprietary valve designed to prevent refilling.[55]
According to SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum, "We created a razor and a razor-blade business model. The razor is obviously the soda maker and we have three blades: the CO2 refills, the flavour syrups, and the bottles. So it's not a one-time sale – the blades are our future revenue stream. We acquire users, build our installed base, and we cultivate those users for life."[56]
In Sweden in 1984, carbonic acid supplier Sydbrand, primarily a supplier of fire equipment, was sued successfully by SodaStream for trademark infringement for refilling SodaStream-labelled CO2 canisters.[57] In 2006, SodaStream lost a suit against the resale of its Alco2jet brand canisters on eBay on the grounds that the canisters were only lent, not sold.[58]
Syrups and concentrates[edit]




SodaStream machine with different syrup packs


SodaStream advertises "100 flavours of the world", an assortment of syrups and concentrates which include "cola", "natural", "clear", "green tea", "ice tea", "isotonic", fruit, "local", "mixers" and "energy" drinks.[59] The concentrates are packaged as 500 ml bottles in which one capful is enough to flavour one litre of soda; 0.5 litre of concentrate makes 12 litre of soda. It is not necessary to add flavours to the carbonated water, it is simply an option.
SodaStream can only carbonate water, one litre at a time, in the supplied bottle – the concentrates are added after carbonated water is removed from the machine. This poses a limitation if one wishes to carbonate wine or fresh fruit juices.[60]
There are no restrictions on obtaining soda syrup from competing vendors. Restaurant-standard 20 litre or 4.2 imperial gallons (5.0 US gal) "bag in box" soda fountain syrups are one means to obtain name-brand soda instead of SodaStream's generic brand. As these are not concentrates, the standard mix is five parts carbonated water to one part syrup. Fountain syrups are available from vendors such as Sam's Club in the United States or from restaurant supply houses.
Users have experimented with various alternative flavours and syrups, including snow cone syrup, concentrates from real fruit juices, powdered drink mixes and home-made or supermarket concoctions.[61] A few small independent vendors offer speciality flavours such as soft drink syrups with real cane sugar.[62] A modern version of the "Hires Root Beer kit" unsweetened concentrate is distributed by the Hires Big H drive-in restaurant chain,[63] but its users must add both sugar and carbonated water. Other manufacturers have tried to make syrups that are more compatible with SodaStream, such as Rio, which makes both a concentrated version that can be sweetened with sugar or other sweeteners, or a fully sweetened version that is ready to use. The use of these syrups has been met with mixed reviews, thought their popularity seems to have increased since SodaStream changed their flavor offerings and formulation.[64]
Environmental marketing[edit]
In its marketing, the company focuses on environmental attractiveness of using tap water and returnable gas cylinders.[4] SodaStream has been involved in environmental projects, including waste reduction, beach cleanup and reforestation.[65]
Americans alone dispose of 130 billion bottles and cans every year,[66] and 340 billion beverage bottles and cans are not recycled every year worldwide.[67] According to SodaStream, use of home carbonation systems reduces packaging waste from bottles and cans, and the pollution caused by the transport of bottled drinks.[68] According to an analysis by Carbon Trust, SodaStream is 75 per cent less greenhouse gas-intensive than generic colas sold in plastic (PET) bottles in the UK.[69]
In 2011, SodaStream partnered with the Israel Union for Environmental Defense to launch an initiative promoting waste reduction and an improvement in the quality of tap water.[70]> Also in 2011, SodaStream launched a campaign with Erin O'Connor to raise awareness to the effects of plastic bottle waste on the environment.[71] As part of the company's support for Climate Week, in 2012 SodaStream donated £1,000 to a school in Crediton, Devon in the United Kingdom to fund an educational beach cleaning initiative.[72][73] SodaStream partnered with Trees for the Future in 2012 to launch the Replant Our Planet initiative: for each home beverage carbonation system sold from its Rethink Your Soda product line, SodaStream committed to planting hundreds of thousands of trees in Brazil.[74][75] SodaStream Italy and the Municipality of Venice partnered in 2012 to organize Join the Stream: fight the bottle, a cleanup initiative with its starting point at the Lido di Venezia.[76] Actress Rosario Dawson launched the first annual Unbottle the World Day in New York City in July 2012. The campaign, initiated by SodaStream to raise awareness to the impact of cans and plastic bottles on the environment, calls on the United Nations to designate one day of the year a "Bottle Free Day".[77]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
In 2010 SodaStream launched an international campaign to raise awareness of bottle and can consumption. The campaign involves the display of 9-cubic-metre cages in various countries, each containing 10,657 empty bottles and cans. Begun in Belgium, the Cage campaign has since visited 30 countries with the message that the waste produced by one family over the course of five years from beverage containers – 10,657 bottles and cans – can be replaced by a single SodaStream bottle. When a cage went on display in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2012, Coca-Cola demanded that SodaStream remove its products from the cages and threatened to sue SodaStream. SodaStream responded by dismissing the threats and announcing that it would display the cage outside Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta.[78][79][80][81]
A 30-second television commercial promoting sustainability,[82] showing soda bottles exploding each time a person makes a drink using a SodaStream machine, was banned in the United Kingdom in 2012.[83][84] Clearcast, the organization that approves TV advertising in the UK, explained that they "thought it was a denigration of the bottled drinks market".[85] The same ad, crafted by Alex Bogusky, ran in the United States, Sweden, Australia, and other countries. An appeal by SodaStream to reverse Clearcast's decision to censor the commercial was rejected.[86][87][88] A similar advertisement, which featured a pair of Coca-Cola and Pepsi deliverymen reacting to the exploding bottles, was expected to air during Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013, but was rejected by CBS for its direct references to Coke and Pepsi. The previous SodaStream ad was shown in its place.[89] SodaStream CEO said "The banned ad was a win because of the quality as well as the quantity of the exposure we received".[90]
Production facilities[edit]
SodaStream has 13 production facilities worldwide. From 2016, SodaStream's principal manufacturing facility is in Idan HaNegev Industrial Park north of Beersheba, Israel. The plant provides employment for around 1,400 workers, many of them Negev Bedouins.[91] The cornerstone for the plant was laid in 2011, it opened in 2015.[8][92][93] An additional plant, which began operating in 2011 in Ashkelon, produces SodaStream syrups and flavours. Another plant operated in the Alon Tavor industrial zone near the Israeli city of Afula, between 2011 and 2015, but was closed once the Idan HaNegev facility was opened.
In Europe, the company employs 250 people, in two main sites; at SodaStream's European commercial and logistics center, which is located in Rijen, Netherlands and at a manufacturing facility in Limburg an der Lahn, Germany. SodaStream's US headquarters is at Mount Laurel, New Jersey.[94]
Controversy[edit]
As part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) activist campaign launched in 2005 to pressure Israel to end the occupation of, among other places, the West Bank,[95] SodaStream has been criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the Mishor Adumim industrial zone in the West Bank.[96][97][98][99]
According to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, the Mishor Adumim factory was built on land taken from five Palestinian towns and two Bedouin tribes evicted by the Israeli army.[100][99]
The European Union's highest court ruled in 2010 that SodaStream was not entitled to claim a "Made in Israel" exemption from EU customs payments for products manufactured in the West Bank because Israeli settlements in the West Bank are outside the territorial scope of the EC-Israel Agreement.[101][102][103][104]
In January 2014, Oxfam accepted the resignation of Scarlett Johansson, an American actress who is half Jewish, as ambassador for that organisation, a role she had held for eight years, after she became a brand ambassador for SodaStream. Oxfam has stated that "businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support"[105] and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law.[106] Johansson reportedly resigned because of "a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement".[105] In her statement she described SodaStream as "not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between Israel and Palestine, supporting neighbours working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights."[105] SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum has also accused Oxfam of supporting the BDS movement against Israel as a whole, a charge Oxfam denied, saying that "this is about trade from the settlements" and specific to settlements outside Israel's pre-1967 border.[107][108] which Oxfam states, due to their location, pose an obstacle to any future two-state solution.[108]
Norway, Sweden and Finland have boycotted SodaStream products from the Mishor Adumim factory.[citation needed] According to Birnbaum, the boycott had no impact on the growth rate of SodaStream, and he said, all SodaStream products sold in Norway, Sweden and Finland are manufactured in China.[108]
In January 2014 a Paris court ruled that Association France Palestine Solidarité (AFPS), a group campaigning to remove SodaStream from stores, must compensate SodaStream €6500 because the group falsely claimed the products are sold "illegally and fraudulently" due to their use of the "Made in Israel" label while being partly manufactured in the West Bank.[109]
Human Rights Watch stated that "It is impossible to ignore the Israeli system of unlawful discrimination, land confiscation, natural resource theft, and forced displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, where SodaStream is located".[10][110][111] The United Church of Canada launched a campaign to boycott SodaStream products manufactured in the West Bank.[112]
In July 2014, UK department store John Lewis removed all SodaStream products from its stores, amidst growing BDS pressure and declining sales. Its Oxford Street, London store has been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of SodaStream products. In July 2014, after two years of weekly BDS protests, SodaStream also closed its Brighton store.[113]
Birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical. "We don't take sides in this conflict. He described the factory as "building bridges between us and the Palestinian population, and we provide our Palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits".[114] SodaStream employs 500 West Bank Palestinians.[115] Addressing the location of SodaStream's Ma'ale Adumim plant, Birnbaum said "we're here for historical reasons." The choice was made by company founder Peter Weissburgh, back in the 1990s, long before SodaStream was taken over by the current owners, who appointed Birnbaum in 2007.[116] Birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it: "We will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political agenda...I just can't see how it would help the cause of the Palestinians if we fired them."[116]
Supporters of the factory cite the West Bank's high unemployment rate and low GDP as evidence the jobs are badly needed. Opponents have argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements do not outweigh the effect the Israeli presence has on the Palestinian economy.[100] Others have argued that SodaStream is exploiting local cheap labour.[117][118] Workers' incomes at the factory are substantially above the 1450 shekel/month Palestinian Authority minimum wage.[108]
All but one of the Palestinian employees interviewed by The Christian Science Monitor supported Johansson's stance and opposed a boycott of SodaStream, stating that a boycott would only hurt them.[95] One Palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for SodaStream and felt like a "slave" working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day.[95] Another Palestinian employee interviewed by Reuters reported that: "Most of the managers are Israeli, and West Bank employees feel they can't ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced."[95][119]
In December 2014, Harvard University Dining Services halted SodaStream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society.[120] A few days later, however, Harvard's President Drew Faust reversed the decision, claiming she had not been aware of it in the first place.[121]
When French host Cyril Hanouna aired a homophobic prank on French TV in May 2017, SodaStream first refused to stop advertising and supporting Hanouna's program,[122] but eventually decided to withdraw its advertising.[123]
Firing of Palestinian workers[edit]
In July 2014, Sodastream fired 60 Palestinian workers after they complained about not receiving sufficient food to break Ramadan fasts during night shifts (the company does not permit employees to bring their own food because the plant follows Jewish dietary restrictions) and called a wildcat strike.[124] The workers were fired after receiving due process hearings, and were given severance pay.[124]
SodaStream announced that its factory in Ma'ale Adumim would be closed by the end of 2016 in order to save $9 million in production costs. The plant's operations will be transferred to a new factory in Lehavim, where it will reportedly "employ a significant number of Bedouin Arabs."[125] The move laid off 500 Palestinian workers, although 74 Palestinian workers moved with SodaStream when it relocated. However, the Israeli government refused to renew the Palestinians' work permits. SodaStream protested the government decision.[13]
Some news sources reported that SodaStream blamed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) for the closing of its plant.[12] Mahmoud Nawajaa, the BDS coordinator in Ramallah, called the loss of Palestinian jobs at SodaStream "part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation."[13] However, SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum blamed Benjamin Netanyahu for the Palestinian job losses. According to Birnbaum, all of the Palestinian employees had passed Israeli security clearance, but were nevertheless denied permits to work after Netanyahu intervened. Birnbaum claims that Netanyahu wanted the Palestinians fired so he could then blame BDS. Netanyahu’s office denied Birnbaum's claims.[126]

SodaStream International Ltd. (NASDAQ: SODA) is an Israeli drinks company best known as the maker of the consumer home carbonation product of the same name.[2][3] The device, like a soda syphon, carbonates water by adding carbon dioxide from a pressurized cylinder to create soda water (or carbonated water) to drink. The company also sells more than 100 types of concentrated syrups and flavourings to make carbonated drinks.[4][5][6]
The company was founded in 1903 in England. After the company merged with Soda-Club in 1998, it was relaunched with an emphasis on healthier drinks. It went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010. SodaStream is headquartered in Lod, Israel[7] and has 13 production plants.
Until 2015 its principal manufacturing facility was located in the Mishor Adumim industrial park in the West Bank, creating controversy and a boycott campaign.[8][9][10] In October 2015, SodaStream closed its factory in Ma'ale Adumim, and moved to a new facility in Lehavim,[11] laying off more than 500 Palestinian workers.[12] While SodaStream tried to retain some of its Palestinian employees, the Israeli government denied them permits.[13]

Product[edit]
The SodaStream drinksmaker is a device that forces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas (stored under pressure in a cylinder) into water, making it fizzy. The product includes a machine, a carbon dioxide cylinder, and one or more reusable beverage bottles. The bottle, filled with water, is threaded onto the machine, and with a button push or two, compressed CO2 from the cylinder is injected, creating carbonated water. Varieties of concentrated syrups are available, to create regular or diet soft drinks by adding a small amount of concentrate to the bottle after carbonation.
Different flavours are created by adding fruit-flavoured concentrates. During its heyday, several famous brands were available in SodaStream concentrate form including Tizer, Fanta, Sunkist and Irn-Bru.[14] SodaStream also offers diet concentrates sweetened with Splenda, and is used as much for plain sparkling water as for soft drinks. SodaStream and Kraft Foods entered into a partnership in January 2012 involving the use of the Crystal Light and Country Time brand flavours with the SodaStream home carbonation system. In July of the same year, the two companies expanded their partnership to include the Kool-Aid flavour line.[15] In 2013, SodaStream partnered with Ocean Spray to market three Ocean Spray flavours for use with the SodaStream home soda maker.[16]
In February 2013, SodaStream and Samsung announced that Samsung refrigerators with built-in SodaStream sparkling water dispensers would be available in the United States beginning in April.[17][18]
Excluding the purchase price of the machine, typical cost to the end user (2015, United States dollars) is 25 cents per litre of carbonated water generated[20] plus another 50 cents per litre for the soda syrup.[22] Pricing in other countries may vary.
This often renders SodaStream drinks more expensive than pre-mixed store brand colas,[24] presumably due to the price of soda syrup in small retail quantities.
History[edit]
The forerunner of the machine, the "Apparatus for aerating liquids",[25] was created in 1903 by Guy Hugh Gilbey of the London gin distillers, W & A Gilbey Ltd.,[14] and was sold to the upper classes (including the royal household).[5] Flavoured concentrates such as cherry ciderette and sarsaparilla, were introduced in the 1920s, along with commercial carbonation machines,[3][5] and the first machine for home carbonation of drinks was produced in 1955.[14] The SodaStream was originally sold in the UK, and later spread to other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.
SodaStream machines were popular during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK, and are associated with nostalgia for that period.[5][6] Their slogan, "Get busy with the fizzy", started as an advertising jingle in 1979 and proved so popular that they added it to their logo. The slogan was initially dropped in 1996 after 17 years,[26] but was reinstated in 2010 along with a new marketing campaign in the UK.[27]
In 1985, after various changes of ownership, SodaStream became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes, although it operated as an autonomous business within the group.[14] In 1998, SodaStream was bought by Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh, who from 1978 to 1991 had been Israel's exclusive distributor for SodaStream, creating the world's largest home carbonation systems supplier.[3][28] In 2003 Soda-Club closed the SodaStream factory in Peterborough, moving the company's gas cylinder refilling and refurbishment department to Germany.[29] Under the ownership of Soda-Club, the brand has been relaunched in many markets, with new machines and new flavours available in 41 countries.[30] In 2012, SodaStream teamed with Yves Béhar to introduce SodaStream Source, a line of soda machines designed with a special emphasis on sustainability.[31][32] Béhar's design earned SodaStream a Good Housekeeping Institute seal of approval in 2013.[33]
2010 NASDAQ IPO[edit]
SodaStream International Ltd. went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010.[34] The stock offering was jointly led by J.P. Morgan Securities and Deutsche Bank Securities.[35] At the time, the IPO was the eighth largest for an Israeli company on the NASDAQ[36] and during the year 2010 one of the top-performing IPOs generally.[37][38] To celebrate SodaStream's listing on the NASDAQ, CEO Daniel Birnbaum was invited to ring the exchange's closing bell on 3 November 2010.[39] By August 2011, SodaStream's market cap had risen from $367 million to $1.46 billion.[40][41] During 2012, the stock experienced aggressive growth, with earnings per share growing 57%. In June 2013, Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist incorrectly predicted a $2 billion Pepsi takeover of SodaStream, sending SODA stock higher before the rumours were promptly debunked by PepsiCo.[42]
Analysts had expected another 27% growth in 2013 with earnings projected to grow 30% over the next 5 years.[43] 2013's actual net earnings were down relative to 2012 despite an increase in sales; in 2014, the company's stock dropped to its lowest value since 2012. Barclays PLC analyst David Kaplan cited U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's warnings about the economic effects of boycotts and the company's failure to clarify the reasons for missed earning targets as causes for the drop.[44]
In October 2014, SodaStream announced its revenue for 2014 was expected to decline to $562.7 million, a 9% decrease from the previous year while a report by Zacks Equity Research stated that net income for 2014 is expected to be 42% lower than in 2013. Zacks Equity Research cited declining sales in the United States, where an increasing number of consumers are choosing "more natural, less caloric and water based beverages" as opposed to traditional carbonated soft drinks.
Sales[edit]
Some 20% of households in Sweden owned SodaStream machines as of 2010.[45] In January 2011, the company marked the sale of its millionth soda maker in the country.[46] Europe accounts for 52% of SodaStream's sales.[47]
SodaStream has been a publicly traded company since 2010.[48] Since May 2012, SodaStream has been sold in over 2,900 Walmart locations in the United States. In June equity research firm Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. stated that SodaStream's machines were selling out at Walmart.[49][50] SodaStream's U.S. sales grew from US$4.4 million in 2007 to $40 million in 2011.[51] Despite record sales, profit margins are declining. SodaStream's estimated 2013 net income ($41.5 million on an annual revenue of $562 million in 2013, compared to 2012's $43.86 million of net income on $436.32 million of revenue) fell short of targets and investor expectations.[52] Sodastream also sells its product at most Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Gas canisters[edit]
The SodaStream counter-top beverage carbonators are typically bundled with a 14.5 ounce proprietary CO2 cylinder, which the company claims to be able to carbonate 60 litres (13 imp gal; 16 US gal) of water. A few selected models can also accept a 33-ounce cylinder advertised as carbonating 130 litres (29 imp gal; 34 US gal) of water. According to the company, when a cylinder is empty, it must be returned to a SodaStream reseller for replacement, however there are ample videos and descriptions online of methods whereby consumers learn how to refill the canisters on their own.[53]
SodaStream does not sell the CO2 canisters to consumers, but instead "licenses" them and expressly limits how they can be used in their User License Certificate.[54] Local CO2 vendors are generally not permitted to refill Sodastream canisters ("carbonators"), which include a proprietary valve designed to prevent refilling.[55]
According to SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum, "We created a razor and a razor-blade business model. The razor is obviously the soda maker and we have three blades: the CO2 refills, the flavour syrups, and the bottles. So it's not a one-time sale – the blades are our future revenue stream. We acquire users, build our installed base, and we cultivate those users for life."[56]
In Sweden in 1984, carbonic acid supplier Sydbrand, primarily a supplier of fire equipment, was sued successfully by SodaStream for trademark infringement for refilling SodaStream-labelled CO2 canisters.[57] In 2006, SodaStream lost a suit against the resale of its Alco2jet brand canisters on eBay on the grounds that the canisters were only lent, not sold.[58]
Syrups and concentrates[edit]

SodaStream advertises "100 flavours of the world", an assortment of syrups and concentrates which include "cola", "natural", "clear", "green tea", "ice tea", "isotonic", fruit, "local", "mixers" and "energy" drinks.[59] The concentrates are packaged as 500 ml bottles in which one capful is enough to flavour one litre of soda; 0.5 litre of concentrate makes 12 litre of soda. It is not necessary to add flavours to the carbonated water, it is simply an option.
SodaStream can only carbonate water, one litre at a time, in the supplied bottle – the concentrates are added after carbonated water is removed from the machine. This poses a limitation if one wishes to carbonate wine or fresh fruit juices.[60]
There are no restrictions on obtaining soda syrup from competing vendors. Restaurant-standard 20 litre or 4.2 imperial gallons (5.0 US gal) "bag in box" soda fountain syrups are one means to obtain name-brand soda instead of SodaStream's generic brand. As these are not concentrates, the standard mix is five parts carbonated water to one part syrup. Fountain syrups are available from vendors such as Sam's Club in the United States or from restaurant supply houses.
Users have experimented with various alternative flavours and syrups, including snow cone syrup, concentrates from real fruit juices, powdered drink mixes and home-made or supermarket concoctions.[61] A few small independent vendors offer speciality flavours such as soft drink syrups with real cane sugar.[62] A modern version of the "Hires Root Beer kit" unsweetened concentrate is distributed by the Hires Big H drive-in restaurant chain,[63] but its users must add both sugar and carbonated water. Other manufacturers have tried to make syrups that are more compatible with SodaStream, such as Rio, which makes both a concentrated version that can be sweetened with sugar or other sweeteners, or a fully sweetened version that is ready to use. The use of these syrups has been met with mixed reviews, thought their popularity seems to have increased since SodaStream changed their flavor offerings and formulation.[64]
Environmental marketing[edit]
In its marketing, the company focuses on environmental attractiveness of using tap water and returnable gas cylinders.[4] SodaStream has been involved in environmental projects, including waste reduction, beach cleanup and reforestation.[65]
Americans alone dispose of 130 billion bottles and cans every year,[66] and 340 billion beverage bottles and cans are not recycled every year worldwide.[67] According to SodaStream, use of home carbonation systems reduces packaging waste from bottles and cans, and the pollution caused by the transport of bottled drinks.[68] According to an analysis by Carbon Trust, SodaStream is 75 per cent less greenhouse gas-intensive than generic colas sold in plastic (PET) bottles in the UK.[69]
In 2011, SodaStream partnered with the Israel Union for Environmental Defense to launch an initiative promoting waste reduction and an improvement in the quality of tap water.[70]> Also in 2011, SodaStream launched a campaign with Erin O'Connor to raise awareness to the effects of plastic bottle waste on the environment.[71] As part of the company's support for Climate Week, in 2012 SodaStream donated £1,000 to a school in Crediton, Devon in the United Kingdom to fund an educational beach cleaning initiative.[72][73] SodaStream partnered with Trees for the Future in 2012 to launch the Replant Our Planet initiative: for each home beverage carbonation system sold from its Rethink Your Soda product line, SodaStream committed to planting hundreds of thousands of trees in Brazil.[74][75] SodaStream Italy and the Municipality of Venice partnered in 2012 to organize Join the Stream: fight the bottle, a cleanup initiative with its starting point at the Lido di Venezia.[76] Actress Rosario Dawson launched the first annual Unbottle the World Day in New York City in July 2012. The campaign, initiated by SodaStream to raise awareness to the impact of cans and plastic bottles on the environment, calls on the United Nations to designate one day of the year a "Bottle Free Day".[77]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
In 2010 SodaStream launched an international campaign to raise awareness of bottle and can consumption. The campaign involves the display of 9-cubic-metre cages in various countries, each containing 10,657 empty bottles and cans. Begun in Belgium, the Cage campaign has since visited 30 countries with the message that the waste produced by one family over the course of five years from beverage containers – 10,657 bottles and cans – can be replaced by a single SodaStream bottle. When a cage went on display in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2012, Coca-Cola demanded that SodaStream remove its products from the cages and threatened to sue SodaStream. SodaStream responded by dismissing the threats and announcing that it would display the cage outside Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta.[78][79][80][81]
A 30-second television commercial promoting sustainability,[82] showing soda bottles exploding each time a person makes a drink using a SodaStream machine, was banned in the United Kingdom in 2012.[83][84] Clearcast, the organization that approves TV advertising in the UK, explained that they "thought it was a denigration of the bottled drinks market".[85] The same ad, crafted by Alex Bogusky, ran in the United States, Sweden, Australia, and other countries. An appeal by SodaStream to reverse Clearcast's decision to censor the commercial was rejected.[86][87][88] A similar advertisement, which featured a pair of Coca-Cola and Pepsi deliverymen reacting to the exploding bottles, was expected to air during Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013, but was rejected by CBS for its direct references to Coke and Pepsi. The previous SodaStream ad was shown in its place.[89] SodaStream CEO said "The banned ad was a win because of the quality as well as the quantity of the exposure we received".[90]
Production facilities[edit]
SodaStream has 13 production facilities worldwide. From 2016, SodaStream's principal manufacturing facility is in Idan HaNegev Industrial Park north of Beersheba, Israel. The plant provides employment for around 1,400 workers, many of them Negev Bedouins.[91] The cornerstone for the plant was laid in 2011, it opened in 2015.[8][92][93] An additional plant, which began operating in 2011 in Ashkelon, produces SodaStream syrups and flavours. Another plant operated in the Alon Tavor industrial zone near the Israeli city of Afula, between 2011 and 2015, but was closed once the Idan HaNegev facility was opened.
In Europe, the company employs 250 people, in two main sites; at SodaStream's European commercial and logistics center, which is located in Rijen, Netherlands and at a manufacturing facility in Limburg an der Lahn, Germany. SodaStream's US headquarters is at Mount Laurel, New Jersey.[94]
Controversy[edit]
As part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) activist campaign launched in 2005 to pressure Israel to end the occupation of, among other places, the West Bank,[95] SodaStream has been criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the Mishor Adumim industrial zone in the West Bank.[96][97][98][99]
According to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, the Mishor Adumim factory was built on land taken from five Palestinian towns and two Bedouin tribes evicted by the Israeli army.[100][99]
The European Union's highest court ruled in 2010 that SodaStream was not entitled to claim a "Made in Israel" exemption from EU customs payments for products manufactured in the West Bank because Israeli settlements in the West Bank are outside the territorial scope of the EC-Israel Agreement.[101][102][103][104]
In January 2014, Oxfam accepted the resignation of Scarlett Johansson, an American actress who is half Jewish, as ambassador for that organisation, a role she had held for eight years, after she became a brand ambassador for SodaStream. Oxfam has stated that "businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support"[105] and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law.[106] Johansson reportedly resigned because of "a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement".[105] In her statement she described SodaStream as "not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between Israel and Palestine, supporting neighbours working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights."[105] SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum has also accused Oxfam of supporting the BDS movement against Israel as a whole, a charge Oxfam denied, saying that "this is about trade from the settlements" and specific to settlements outside Israel's pre-1967 border.[107][108] which Oxfam states, due to their location, pose an obstacle to any future two-state solution.[108]
Norway, Sweden and Finland have boycotted SodaStream products from the Mishor Adumim factory.[citation needed] According to Birnbaum, the boycott had no impact on the growth rate of SodaStream, and he said, all SodaStream products sold in Norway, Sweden and Finland are manufactured in China.[108]
In January 2014 a Paris court ruled that Association France Palestine Solidarité (AFPS), a group campaigning to remove SodaStream from stores, must compensate SodaStream €6500 because the group falsely claimed the products are sold "illegally and fraudulently" due to their use of the "Made in Israel" label while being partly manufactured in the West Bank.[109]
Human Rights Watch stated that "It is impossible to ignore the Israeli system of unlawful discrimination, land confiscation, natural resource theft, and forced displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, where SodaStream is located".[10][110][111] The United Church of Canada launched a campaign to boycott SodaStream products manufactured in the West Bank.[112]
In July 2014, UK department store John Lewis removed all SodaStream products from its stores, amidst growing BDS pressure and declining sales. Its Oxford Street, London store has been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of SodaStream products. In July 2014, after two years of weekly BDS protests, SodaStream also closed its Brighton store.[113]
Birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical. "We don't take sides in this conflict. He described the factory as "building bridges between us and the Palestinian population, and we provide our Palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits".[114] SodaStream employs 500 West Bank Palestinians.[115] Addressing the location of SodaStream's Ma'ale Adumim plant, Birnbaum said "we're here for historical reasons." The choice was made by company founder Peter Weissburgh, back in the 1990s, long before SodaStream was taken over by the current owners, who appointed Birnbaum in 2007.[116] Birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it: "We will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political agenda...I just can't see how it would help the cause of the Palestinians if we fired them."[116]
Supporters of the factory cite the West Bank's high unemployment rate and low GDP as evidence the jobs are badly needed. Opponents have argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements do not outweigh the effect the Israeli presence has on the Palestinian economy.[100] Others have argued that SodaStream is exploiting local cheap labour.[117][118] Workers' incomes at the factory are substantially above the 1450 shekel/month Palestinian Authority minimum wage.[108]
All but one of the Palestinian employees interviewed by The Christian Science Monitor supported Johansson's stance and opposed a boycott of SodaStream, stating that a boycott would only hurt them.[95] One Palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for SodaStream and felt like a "slave" working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day.[95] Another Palestinian employee interviewed by Reuters reported that: "Most of the managers are Israeli, and West Bank employees feel they can't ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced."[95][119]
In December 2014, Harvard University Dining Services halted SodaStream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society.[120] A few days later, however, Harvard's President Drew Faust reversed the decision, claiming she had not been aware of it in the first place.[121]
When French host Cyril Hanouna aired a homophobic prank on French TV in May 2017, SodaStream first refused to stop advertising and supporting Hanouna's program,[122] but eventually decided to withdraw its advertising.[123]
Firing of Palestinian workers[edit]
In July 2014, Sodastream fired 60 Palestinian workers after they complained about not receiving sufficient food to break Ramadan fasts during night shifts (the company does not permit employees to bring their own food because the plant follows Jewish dietary restrictions) and called a wildcat strike.[124] The workers were fired after receiving due process hearings, and were given severance pay.[124]
SodaStream announced that its factory in Ma'ale Adumim would be closed by the end of 2016 in order to save $9 million in production costs. The plant's operations will be transferred to a new factory in Lehavim, where it will reportedly "employ a significant number of Bedouin Arabs."[125] The move laid off 500 Palestinian workers, although 74 Palestinian workers moved with SodaStream when it relocated. However, the Israeli government refused to renew the Palestinians' work permits. SodaStream protested the government decision.[13]
Some news sources reported that SodaStream blamed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) for the closing of its plant.[12] Mahmoud Nawajaa, the BDS coordinator in Ramallah, called the loss of Palestinian jobs at SodaStream "part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation."[13] However, SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum blamed Benjamin Netanyahu for the Palestinian job losses. According to Birnbaum, all of the Palestinian employees had passed Israeli security clearance, but were nevertheless denied permits to work after Netanyahu intervened. Birnbaum claims that Netanyahu wanted the Palestinians fired so he could then blame BDS. Netanyahu’s office denied Birnbaum's claims.[126]

SodaStream International Ltd. (NASDAQ: SODA) is an Israeli drinks company best known as the maker of the consumer home carbonation product of the same name.[2][3] The device, like a soda syphon, carbonates water by adding carbon dioxide from a pressurized cylinder to create soda water (or carbonated water) to drink. The company also sells more than 100 types of concentrated syrups and flavourings to make carbonated drinks.[4][5][6]
The company was founded in 1903 in England. After the company merged with Soda-Club in 1998, it was relaunched with an emphasis on healthier drinks. It went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010. SodaStream is headquartered in Lod, Israel[7] and has 13 production plants.
Until 2015 its principal manufacturing facility was located in the Mishor Adumim industrial park in the West Bank, creating controversy and a boycott campaign.[8][9][10] In October 2015, SodaStream closed its factory in Ma'ale Adumim, and moved to a new facility in Lehavim,[11] laying off more than 500 Palestinian workers.[12] While SodaStream tried to retain some of its Palestinian employees, the Israeli government denied them permits.[13]

Product[edit]
The SodaStream drinksmaker is a device that forces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas (stored under pressure in a cylinder) into water, making it fizzy. The product includes a machine, a carbon dioxide cylinder, and one or more reusable beverage bottles. The bottle, filled with water, is threaded onto the machine, and with a button push or two, compressed CO2 from the cylinder is injected, creating carbonated water. Varieties of concentrated syrups are available, to create regular or diet soft drinks by adding a small amount of concentrate to the bottle after carbonation.
Different flavours are created by adding fruit-flavoured concentrates. During its heyday, several famous brands were available in SodaStream concentrate form including Tizer, Fanta, Sunkist and Irn-Bru.[14] SodaStream also offers diet concentrates sweetened with Splenda, and is used as much for plain sparkling water as for soft drinks. SodaStream and Kraft Foods entered into a partnership in January 2012 involving the use of the Crystal Light and Country Time brand flavours with the SodaStream home carbonation system. In July of the same year, the two companies expanded their partnership to include the Kool-Aid flavour line.[15] In 2013, SodaStream partnered with Ocean Spray to market three Ocean Spray flavours for use with the SodaStream home soda maker.[16]
In February 2013, SodaStream and Samsung announced that Samsung refrigerators with built-in SodaStream sparkling water dispensers would be available in the United States beginning in April.[17][18]
Excluding the purchase price of the machine, typical cost to the end user (2015, United States dollars) is 25 cents per litre of carbonated water generated[20] plus another 50 cents per litre for the soda syrup.[22] Pricing in other countries may vary.
This often renders SodaStream drinks more expensive than pre-mixed store brand colas,[24] presumably due to the price of soda syrup in small retail quantities.
History[edit]
The forerunner of the machine, the "Apparatus for aerating liquids",[25] was created in 1903 by Guy Hugh Gilbey of the London gin distillers, W & A Gilbey Ltd.,[14] and was sold to the upper classes (including the royal household).[5] Flavoured concentrates such as cherry ciderette and sarsaparilla, were introduced in the 1920s, along with commercial carbonation machines,[3][5] and the first machine for home carbonation of drinks was produced in 1955.[14] The SodaStream was originally sold in the UK, and later spread to other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.
SodaStream machines were popular during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK, and are associated with nostalgia for that period.[5][6] Their slogan, "Get busy with the fizzy", started as an advertising jingle in 1979 and proved so popular that they added it to their logo. The slogan was initially dropped in 1996 after 17 years,[26] but was reinstated in 2010 along with a new marketing campaign in the UK.[27]
In 1985, after various changes of ownership, SodaStream became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes, although it operated as an autonomous business within the group.[14] In 1998, SodaStream was bought by Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh, who from 1978 to 1991 had been Israel's exclusive distributor for SodaStream, creating the world's largest home carbonation systems supplier.[3][28] In 2003 Soda-Club closed the SodaStream factory in Peterborough, moving the company's gas cylinder refilling and refurbishment department to Germany.[29] Under the ownership of Soda-Club, the brand has been relaunched in many markets, with new machines and new flavours available in 41 countries.[30] In 2012, SodaStream teamed with Yves Béhar to introduce SodaStream Source, a line of soda machines designed with a special emphasis on sustainability.[31][32] Béhar's design earned SodaStream a Good Housekeeping Institute seal of approval in 2013.[33]
2010 NASDAQ IPO[edit]
SodaStream International Ltd. went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010.[34] The stock offering was jointly led by J.P. Morgan Securities and Deutsche Bank Securities.[35] At the time, the IPO was the eighth largest for an Israeli company on the NASDAQ[36] and during the year 2010 one of the top-performing IPOs generally.[37][38] To celebrate SodaStream's listing on the NASDAQ, CEO Daniel Birnbaum was invited to ring the exchange's closing bell on 3 November 2010.[39] By August 2011, SodaStream's market cap had risen from $367 million to $1.46 billion.[40][41] During 2012, the stock experienced aggressive growth, with earnings per share growing 57%. In June 2013, Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist incorrectly predicted a $2 billion Pepsi takeover of SodaStream, sending SODA stock higher before the rumours were promptly debunked by PepsiCo.[42]
Analysts had expected another 27% growth in 2013 with earnings projected to grow 30% over the next 5 years.[43] 2013's actual net earnings were down relative to 2012 despite an increase in sales; in 2014, the company's stock dropped to its lowest value since 2012. Barclays PLC analyst David Kaplan cited U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's warnings about the economic effects of boycotts and the company's failure to clarify the reasons for missed earning targets as causes for the drop.[44]
In October 2014, SodaStream announced its revenue for 2014 was expected to decline to $562.7 million, a 9% decrease from the previous year while a report by Zacks Equity Research stated that net income for 2014 is expected to be 42% lower than in 2013. Zacks Equity Research cited declining sales in the United States, where an increasing number of consumers are choosing "more natural, less caloric and water based beverages" as opposed to traditional carbonated soft drinks.
Sales[edit]
Some 20% of households in Sweden owned SodaStream machines as of 2010.[45] In January 2011, the company marked the sale of its millionth soda maker in the country.[46] Europe accounts for 52% of SodaStream's sales.[47]
SodaStream has been a publicly traded company since 2010.[48] Since May 2012, SodaStream has been sold in over 2,900 Walmart locations in the United States. In June equity research firm Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. stated that SodaStream's machines were selling out at Walmart.[49][50] SodaStream's U.S. sales grew from US$4.4 million in 2007 to $40 million in 2011.[51] Despite record sales, profit margins are declining. SodaStream's estimated 2013 net income ($41.5 million on an annual revenue of $562 million in 2013, compared to 2012's $43.86 million of net income on $436.32 million of revenue) fell short of targets and investor expectations.[52] Sodastream also sells its product at most Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Gas canisters[edit]
The SodaStream counter-top beverage carbonators are typically bundled with a 14.5 ounce proprietary CO2 cylinder, which the company claims to be able to carbonate 60 litres (13 imp gal; 16 US gal) of water. A few selected models can also accept a 33-ounce cylinder advertised as carbonating 130 litres (29 imp gal; 34 US gal) of water. According to the company, when a cylinder is empty, it must be returned to a SodaStream reseller for replacement, however there are ample videos and descriptions online of methods whereby consumers learn how to refill the canisters on their own.[53]
SodaStream does not sell the CO2 canisters to consumers, but instead "licenses" them and expressly limits how they can be used in their User License Certificate.[54] Local CO2 vendors are generally not permitted to refill Sodastream canisters ("carbonators"), which include a proprietary valve designed to prevent refilling.[55]
According to SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum, "We created a razor and a razor-blade business model. The razor is obviously the soda maker and we have three blades: the CO2 refills, the flavour syrups, and the bottles. So it's not a one-time sale – the blades are our future revenue stream. We acquire users, build our installed base, and we cultivate those users for life."[56]
In Sweden in 1984, carbonic acid supplier Sydbrand, primarily a supplier of fire equipment, was sued successfully by SodaStream for trademark infringement for refilling SodaStream-labelled CO2 canisters.[57] In 2006, SodaStream lost a suit against the resale of its Alco2jet brand canisters on eBay on the grounds that the canisters were only lent, not sold.[58]
Syrups and concentrates[edit]




SodaStream machine with different syrup packs


SodaStream advertises "100 flavours of the world", an assortment of syrups and concentrates which include "cola", "natural", "clear", "green tea", "ice tea", "isotonic", fruit, "local", "mixers" and "energy" drinks.[59] The concentrates are packaged as 500 ml bottles in which one capful is enough to flavour one litre of soda; 0.5 litre of concentrate makes 12 litre of soda. It is not necessary to add flavours to the carbonated water, it is simply an option.
SodaStream can only carbonate water, one litre at a time, in the supplied bottle – the concentrates are added after carbonated water is removed from the machine. This poses a limitation if one wishes to carbonate wine or fresh fruit juices.[60]
There are no restrictions on obtaining soda syrup from competing vendors. Restaurant-standard 20 litre or 4.2 imperial gallons (5.0 US gal) "bag in box" soda fountain syrups are one means to obtain name-brand soda instead of SodaStream's generic brand. As these are not concentrates, the standard mix is five parts carbonated water to one part syrup. Fountain syrups are available from vendors such as Sam's Club in the United States or from restaurant supply houses.
Users have experimented with various alternative flavours and syrups, including snow cone syrup, concentrates from real fruit juices, powdered drink mixes and home-made or supermarket concoctions.[61] A few small independent vendors offer speciality flavours such as soft drink syrups with real cane sugar.[62] A modern version of the "Hires Root Beer kit" unsweetened concentrate is distributed by the Hires Big H drive-in restaurant chain,[63] but its users must add both sugar and carbonated water. Other manufacturers have tried to make syrups that are more compatible with SodaStream, such as Rio, which makes both a concentrated version that can be sweetened with sugar or other sweeteners, or a fully sweetened version that is ready to use. The use of these syrups has been met with mixed reviews, thought their popularity seems to have increased since SodaStream changed their flavor offerings and formulation.[64]
Environmental marketing[edit]
In its marketing, the company focuses on environmental attractiveness of using tap water and returnable gas cylinders.[4] SodaStream has been involved in environmental projects, including waste reduction, beach cleanup and reforestation.[65]
Americans alone dispose of 130 billion bottles and cans every year,[66] and 340 billion beverage bottles and cans are not recycled every year worldwide.[67] According to SodaStream, use of home carbonation systems reduces packaging waste from bottles and cans, and the pollution caused by the transport of bottled drinks.[68] According to an analysis by Carbon Trust, SodaStream is 75 per cent less greenhouse gas-intensive than generic colas sold in plastic (PET) bottles in the UK.[69]
In 2011, SodaStream partnered with the Israel Union for Environmental Defense to launch an initiative promoting waste reduction and an improvement in the quality of tap water.[70]> Also in 2011, SodaStream launched a campaign with Erin O'Connor to raise awareness to the effects of plastic bottle waste on the environment.[71] As part of the company's support for Climate Week, in 2012 SodaStream donated £1,000 to a school in Crediton, Devon in the United Kingdom to fund an educational beach cleaning initiative.[72][73] SodaStream partnered with Trees for the Future in 2012 to launch the Replant Our Planet initiative: for each home beverage carbonation system sold from its Rethink Your Soda product line, SodaStream committed to planting hundreds of thousands of trees in Brazil.[74][75] SodaStream Italy and the Municipality of Venice partnered in 2012 to organize Join the Stream: fight the bottle, a cleanup initiative with its starting point at the Lido di Venezia.[76] Actress Rosario Dawson launched the first annual Unbottle the World Day in New York City in July 2012. The campaign, initiated by SodaStream to raise awareness to the impact of cans and plastic bottles on the environment, calls on the United Nations to designate one day of the year a "Bottle Free Day".[77]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
In 2010 SodaStream launched an international campaign to raise awareness of bottle and can consumption. The campaign involves the display of 9-cubic-metre cages in various countries, each containing 10,657 empty bottles and cans. Begun in Belgium, the Cage campaign has since visited 30 countries with the message that the waste produced by one family over the course of five years from beverage containers – 10,657 bottles and cans – can be replaced by a single SodaStream bottle. When a cage went on display in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2012, Coca-Cola demanded that SodaStream remove its products from the cages and threatened to sue SodaStream. SodaStream responded by dismissing the threats and announcing that it would display the cage outside Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta.[78][79][80][81]
A 30-second television commercial promoting sustainability,[82] showing soda bottles exploding each time a person makes a drink using a SodaStream machine, was banned in the United Kingdom in 2012.[83][84] Clearcast, the organization that approves TV advertising in the UK, explained that they "thought it was a denigration of the bottled drinks market".[85] The same ad, crafted by Alex Bogusky, ran in the United States, Sweden, Australia, and other countries. An appeal by SodaStream to reverse Clearcast's decision to censor the commercial was rejected.[86][87][88] A similar advertisement, which featured a pair of Coca-Cola and Pepsi deliverymen reacting to the exploding bottles, was expected to air during Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013, but was rejected by CBS for its direct references to Coke and Pepsi. The previous SodaStream ad was shown in its place.[89] SodaStream CEO said "The banned ad was a win because of the quality as well as the quantity of the exposure we received".[90]
Production facilities[edit]
SodaStream has 13 production facilities worldwide. From 2016, SodaStream's principal manufacturing facility is in Idan HaNegev Industrial Park north of Beersheba, Israel. The plant provides employment for around 1,400 workers, many of them Negev Bedouins.[91] The cornerstone for the plant was laid in 2011, it opened in 2015.[8][92][93] An additional plant, which began operating in 2011 in Ashkelon, produces SodaStream syrups and flavours. Another plant operated in the Alon Tavor industrial zone near the Israeli city of Afula, between 2011 and 2015, but was closed once the Idan HaNegev facility was opened.
In Europe, the company employs 250 people, in two main sites; at SodaStream's European commercial and logistics center, which is located in Rijen, Netherlands and at a manufacturing facility in Limburg an der Lahn, Germany. SodaStream's US headquarters is at Mount Laurel, New Jersey.[94]
Controversy[edit]
As part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) activist campaign launched in 2005 to pressure Israel to end the occupation of, among other places, the West Bank,[95] SodaStream has been criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the Mishor Adumim industrial zone in the West Bank.[96][97][98][99]
According to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, the Mishor Adumim factory was built on land taken from five Palestinian towns and two Bedouin tribes evicted by the Israeli army.[100][99]
The European Union's highest court ruled in 2010 that SodaStream was not entitled to claim a "Made in Israel" exemption from EU customs payments for products manufactured in the West Bank because Israeli settlements in the West Bank are outside the territorial scope of the EC-Israel Agreement.[101][102][103][104]
In January 2014, Oxfam accepted the resignation of Scarlett Johansson, an American actress who is half Jewish, as ambassador for that organisation, a role she had held for eight years, after she became a brand ambassador for SodaStream. Oxfam has stated that "businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support"[105] and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law.[106] Johansson reportedly resigned because of "a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement".[105] In her statement she described SodaStream as "not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between Israel and Palestine, supporting neighbours working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights."[105] SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum has also accused Oxfam of supporting the BDS movement against Israel as a whole, a charge Oxfam denied, saying that "this is about trade from the settlements" and specific to settlements outside Israel's pre-1967 border.[107][108] which Oxfam states, due to their location, pose an obstacle to any future two-state solution.[108]
Norway, Sweden and Finland have boycotted SodaStream products from the Mishor Adumim factory.[citation needed] According to Birnbaum, the boycott had no impact on the growth rate of SodaStream, and he said, all SodaStream products sold in Norway, Sweden and Finland are manufactured in China.[108]
In January 2014 a Paris court ruled that Association France Palestine Solidarité (AFPS), a group campaigning to remove SodaStream from stores, must compensate SodaStream €6500 because the group falsely claimed the products are sold "illegally and fraudulently" due to their use of the "Made in Israel" label while being partly manufactured in the West Bank.[109]
Human Rights Watch stated that "It is impossible to ignore the Israeli system of unlawful discrimination, land confiscation, natural resource theft, and forced displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, where SodaStream is located".[10][110][111] The United Church of Canada launched a campaign to boycott SodaStream products manufactured in the West Bank.[112]
In July 2014, UK department store John Lewis removed all SodaStream products from its stores, amidst growing BDS pressure and declining sales. Its Oxford Street, London store has been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of SodaStream products. In July 2014, after two years of weekly BDS protests, SodaStream also closed its Brighton store.[113]
Birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical. "We don't take sides in this conflict. He described the factory as "building bridges between us and the Palestinian population, and we provide our Palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits".[114] SodaStream employs 500 West Bank Palestinians.[115] Addressing the location of SodaStream's Ma'ale Adumim plant, Birnbaum said "we're here for historical reasons." The choice was made by company founder Peter Weissburgh, back in the 1990s, long before SodaStream was taken over by the current owners, who appointed Birnbaum in 2007.[116] Birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it: "We will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political agenda...I just can't see how it would help the cause of the Palestinians if we fired them."[116]
Supporters of the factory cite the West Bank's high unemployment rate and low GDP as evidence the jobs are badly needed. Opponents have argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements do not outweigh the effect the Israeli presence has on the Palestinian economy.[100] Others have argued that SodaStream is exploiting local cheap labour.[117][118] Workers' incomes at the factory are substantially above the 1450 shekel/month Palestinian Authority minimum wage.[108]
All but one of the Palestinian employees interviewed by The Christian Science Monitor supported Johansson's stance and opposed a boycott of SodaStream, stating that a boycott would only hurt them.[95] One Palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for SodaStream and felt like a "slave" working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day.[95] Another Palestinian employee interviewed by Reuters reported that: "Most of the managers are Israeli, and West Bank employees feel they can't ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced."[95][119]
In December 2014, Harvard University Dining Services halted SodaStream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society.[120] A few days later, however, Harvard's President Drew Faust reversed the decision, claiming she had not been aware of it in the first place.[121]
When French host Cyril Hanouna aired a homophobic prank on French TV in May 2017, SodaStream first refused to stop advertising and supporting Hanouna's program,[122] but eventually decided to withdraw its advertising.[123]
Firing of Palestinian workers[edit]
In July 2014, Sodastream fired 60 Palestinian workers after they complained about not receiving sufficient food to break Ramadan fasts during night shifts (the company does not permit employees to bring their own food because the plant follows Jewish dietary restrictions) and called a wildcat strike.[124] The workers were fired after receiving due process hearings, and were given severance pay.[124]
SodaStream announced that its factory in Ma'ale Adumim would be closed by the end of 2016 in order to save $9 million in production costs. The plant's operations will be transferred to a new factory in Lehavim, where it will reportedly "employ a significant number of Bedouin Arabs."[125] The move laid off 500 Palestinian workers, although 74 Palestinian workers moved with SodaStream when it relocated. However, the Israeli government refused to renew the Palestinians' work permits. SodaStream protested the government decision.[13]
Some news sources reported that SodaStream blamed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) for the closing of its plant.[12] Mahmoud Nawajaa, the BDS coordinator in Ramallah, called the loss of Palestinian jobs at SodaStream "part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation."[13] However, SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum blamed Benjamin Netanyahu for the Palestinian job losses. According to Birnbaum, all of the Palestinian employees had passed Israeli security clearance, but were nevertheless denied permits to work after Netanyahu intervened. Birnbaum claims that Netanyahu wanted the Palestinians fired so he could then blame BDS. Netanyahu’s office denied Birnbaum's claims.[126]

SodaStream International Ltd. (NASDAQ: SODA) is an Israeli drinks company best known as the maker of the consumer home carbonation product of the same name.[2][3] The device, like a soda syphon, carbonates water by adding carbon dioxide from a pressurized cylinder to create soda water (or carbonated water) to drink. The company also sells more than 100 types of concentrated syrups and flavourings to make carbonated drinks.[4][5][6]
The company was founded in 1903 in England. After the company merged with Soda-Club in 1998, it was relaunched with an emphasis on healthier drinks. It went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010. SodaStream is headquartered in Lod, Israel[7] and has 13 production plants.
Until 2015 its principal manufacturing facility was located in the Mishor Adumim industrial park in the West Bank, creating controversy and a boycott campaign.[8][9][10] In October 2015, SodaStream closed its factory in Ma'ale Adumim, and moved to a new facility in Lehavim,[11] laying off more than 500 Palestinian workers.[12] While SodaStream tried to retain some of its Palestinian employees, the Israeli government denied them permits.[13]

Product[edit]
The SodaStream drinksmaker is a device that forces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas (stored under pressure in a cylinder) into water, making it fizzy. The product includes a machine, a carbon dioxide cylinder, and one or more reusable beverage bottles. The bottle, filled with water, is threaded onto the machine, and with a button push or two, compressed CO2 from the cylinder is injected, creating carbonated water. Varieties of concentrated syrups are available, to create regular or diet soft drinks by adding a small amount of concentrate to the bottle after carbonation.
Different flavours are created by adding fruit-flavoured concentrates. During its heyday, several famous brands were available in SodaStream concentrate form including Tizer, Fanta, Sunkist and Irn-Bru.[14] SodaStream also offers diet concentrates sweetened with Splenda, and is used as much for plain sparkling water as for soft drinks. SodaStream and Kraft Foods entered into a partnership in January 2012 involving the use of the Crystal Light and Country Time brand flavours with the SodaStream home carbonation system. In July of the same year, the two companies expanded their partnership to include the Kool-Aid flavour line.[15] In 2013, SodaStream partnered with Ocean Spray to market three Ocean Spray flavours for use with the SodaStream home soda maker.[16]
In February 2013, SodaStream and Samsung announced that Samsung refrigerators with built-in SodaStream sparkling water dispensers would be available in the United States beginning in April.[17][18]
Excluding the purchase price of the machine, typical cost to the end user (2015, United States dollars) is 25 cents per litre of carbonated water generated[20] plus another 50 cents per litre for the soda syrup.[22] Pricing in other countries may vary.
This often renders SodaStream drinks more expensive than pre-mixed store brand colas,[24] presumably due to the price of soda syrup in small retail quantities.
History[edit]
The forerunner of the machine, the "Apparatus for aerating liquids",[25] was created in 1903 by Guy Hugh Gilbey of the London gin distillers, W & A Gilbey Ltd.,[14] and was sold to the upper classes (including the royal household).[5] Flavoured concentrates such as cherry ciderette and sarsaparilla, were introduced in the 1920s, along with commercial carbonation machines,[3][5] and the first machine for home carbonation of drinks was produced in 1955.[14] The SodaStream was originally sold in the UK, and later spread to other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.
SodaStream machines were popular during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK, and are associated with nostalgia for that period.[5][6] Their slogan, "Get busy with the fizzy", started as an advertising jingle in 1979 and proved so popular that they added it to their logo. The slogan was initially dropped in 1996 after 17 years,[26] but was reinstated in 2010 along with a new marketing campaign in the UK.[27]
In 1985, after various changes of ownership, SodaStream became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes, although it operated as an autonomous business within the group.[14] In 1998, SodaStream was bought by Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh, who from 1978 to 1991 had been Israel's exclusive distributor for SodaStream, creating the world's largest home carbonation systems supplier.[3][28] In 2003 Soda-Club closed the SodaStream factory in Peterborough, moving the company's gas cylinder refilling and refurbishment department to Germany.[29] Under the ownership of Soda-Club, the brand has been relaunched in many markets, with new machines and new flavours available in 41 countries.[30] In 2012, SodaStream teamed with Yves Béhar to introduce SodaStream Source, a line of soda machines designed with a special emphasis on sustainability.[31][32] Béhar's design earned SodaStream a Good Housekeeping Institute seal of approval in 2013.[33]
2010 NASDAQ IPO[edit]
SodaStream International Ltd. went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010.[34] The stock offering was jointly led by J.P. Morgan Securities and Deutsche Bank Securities.[35] At the time, the IPO was the eighth largest for an Israeli company on the NASDAQ[36] and during the year 2010 one of the top-performing IPOs generally.[37][38] To celebrate SodaStream's listing on the NASDAQ, CEO Daniel Birnbaum was invited to ring the exchange's closing bell on 3 November 2010.[39] By August 2011, SodaStream's market cap had risen from $367 million to $1.46 billion.[40][41] During 2012, the stock experienced aggressive growth, with earnings per share growing 57%. In June 2013, Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist incorrectly predicted a $2 billion Pepsi takeover of SodaStream, sending SODA stock higher before the rumours were promptly debunked by PepsiCo.[42]
Analysts had expected another 27% growth in 2013 with earnings projected to grow 30% over the next 5 years.[43] 2013's actual net earnings were down relative to 2012 despite an increase in sales; in 2014, the company's stock dropped to its lowest value since 2012. Barclays PLC analyst David Kaplan cited U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's warnings about the economic effects of boycotts and the company's failure to clarify the reasons for missed earning targets as causes for the drop.[44]
In October 2014, SodaStream announced its revenue for 2014 was expected to decline to $562.7 million, a 9% decrease from the previous year while a report by Zacks Equity Research stated that net income for 2014 is expected to be 42% lower than in 2013. Zacks Equity Research cited declining sales in the United States, where an increasing number of consumers are choosing "more natural, less caloric and water based beverages" as opposed to traditional carbonated soft drinks.
Sales[edit]
Some 20% of households in Sweden owned SodaStream machines as of 2010.[45] In January 2011, the company marked the sale of its millionth soda maker in the country.[46] Europe accounts for 52% of SodaStream's sales.[47]
SodaStream has been a publicly traded company since 2010.[48] Since May 2012, SodaStream has been sold in over 2,900 Walmart locations in the United States. In June equity research firm Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. stated that SodaStream's machines were selling out at Walmart.[49][50] SodaStream's U.S. sales grew from US$4.4 million in 2007 to $40 million in 2011.[51] Despite record sales, profit margins are declining. SodaStream's estimated 2013 net income ($41.5 million on an annual revenue of $562 million in 2013, compared to 2012's $43.86 million of net income on $436.32 million of revenue) fell short of targets and investor expectations.[52] Sodastream also sells its product at most Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Gas canisters[edit]
The SodaStream counter-top beverage carbonators are typically bundled with a 14.5 ounce proprietary CO2 cylinder, which the company claims to be able to carbonate 60 litres (13 imp gal; 16 US gal) of water. A few selected models can also accept a 33-ounce cylinder advertised as carbonating 130 litres (29 imp gal; 34 US gal) of water. According to the company, when a cylinder is empty, it must be returned to a SodaStream reseller for replacement, however there are ample videos and descriptions online of methods whereby consumers learn how to refill the canisters on their own.[53]
SodaStream does not sell the CO2 canisters to consumers, but instead "licenses" them and expressly limits how they can be used in their User License Certificate.[54] Local CO2 vendors are generally not permitted to refill Sodastream canisters ("carbonators"), which include a proprietary valve designed to prevent refilling.[55]
According to SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum, "We created a razor and a razor-blade business model. The razor is obviously the soda maker and we have three blades: the CO2 refills, the flavour syrups, and the bottles. So it's not a one-time sale – the blades are our future revenue stream. We acquire users, build our installed base, and we cultivate those users for life."[56]
In Sweden in 1984, carbonic acid supplier Sydbrand, primarily a supplier of fire equipment, was sued successfully by SodaStream for trademark infringement for refilling SodaStream-labelled CO2 canisters.[57] In 2006, SodaStream lost a suit against the resale of its Alco2jet brand canisters on eBay on the grounds that the canisters were only lent, not sold.[58]
Syrups and concentrates[edit]




SodaStream machine with different syrup packs


SodaStream advertises "100 flavours of the world", an assortment of syrups and concentrates which include "cola", "natural", "clear", "green tea", "ice tea", "isotonic", fruit, "local", "mixers" and "energy" drinks.[59] The concentrates are packaged as 500 ml bottles in which one capful is enough to flavour one litre of soda; 0.5 litre of concentrate makes 12 litre of soda. It is not necessary to add flavours to the carbonated water, it is simply an option.
SodaStream can only carbonate water, one litre at a time, in the supplied bottle – the concentrates are added after carbonated water is removed from the machine. This poses a limitation if one wishes to carbonate wine or fresh fruit juices.[60]
There are no restrictions on obtaining soda syrup from competing vendors. Restaurant-standard 20 litre or 4.2 imperial gallons (5.0 US gal) "bag in box" soda fountain syrups are one means to obtain name-brand soda instead of SodaStream's generic brand. As these are not concentrates, the standard mix is five parts carbonated water to one part syrup. Fountain syrups are available from vendors such as Sam's Club in the United States or from restaurant supply houses.
Users have experimented with various alternative flavours and syrups, including snow cone syrup, concentrates from real fruit juices, powdered drink mixes and home-made or supermarket concoctions.[61] A few small independent vendors offer speciality flavours such as soft drink syrups with real cane sugar.[62] A modern version of the "Hires Root Beer kit" unsweetened concentrate is distributed by the Hires Big H drive-in restaurant chain,[63] but its users must add both sugar and carbonated water. Other manufacturers have tried to make syrups that are more compatible with SodaStream, such as Rio, which makes both a concentrated version that can be sweetened with sugar or other sweeteners, or a fully sweetened version that is ready to use. The use of these syrups has been met with mixed reviews, thought their popularity seems to have increased since SodaStream changed their flavor offerings and formulation.[64]
Environmental marketing[edit]
In its marketing, the company focuses on environmental attractiveness of using tap water and returnable gas cylinders.[4] SodaStream has been involved in environmental projects, including waste reduction, beach cleanup and reforestation.[65]
Americans alone dispose of 130 billion bottles and cans every year,[66] and 340 billion beverage bottles and cans are not recycled every year worldwide.[67] According to SodaStream, use of home carbonation systems reduces packaging waste from bottles and cans, and the pollution caused by the transport of bottled drinks.[68] According to an analysis by Carbon Trust, SodaStream is 75 per cent less greenhouse gas-intensive than generic colas sold in plastic (PET) bottles in the UK.[69]
In 2011, SodaStream partnered with the Israel Union for Environmental Defense to launch an initiative promoting waste reduction and an improvement in the quality of tap water.[70]> Also in 2011, SodaStream launched a campaign with Erin O'Connor to raise awareness to the effects of plastic bottle waste on the environment.[71] As part of the company's support for Climate Week, in 2012 SodaStream donated £1,000 to a school in Crediton, Devon in the United Kingdom to fund an educational beach cleaning initiative.[72][73] SodaStream partnered with Trees for the Future in 2012 to launch the Replant Our Planet initiative: for each home beverage carbonation system sold from its Rethink Your Soda product line, SodaStream committed to planting hundreds of thousands of trees in Brazil.[74][75] SodaStream Italy and the Municipality of Venice partnered in 2012 to organize Join the Stream: fight the bottle, a cleanup initiative with its starting point at the Lido di Venezia.[76] Actress Rosario Dawson launched the first annual Unbottle the World Day in New York City in July 2012. The campaign, initiated by SodaStream to raise awareness to the impact of cans and plastic bottles on the environment, calls on the United Nations to designate one day of the year a "Bottle Free Day".[77]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
In 2010 SodaStream launched an international campaign to raise awareness of bottle and can consumption. The campaign involves the display of 9-cubic-metre cages in various countries, each containing 10,657 empty bottles and cans. Begun in Belgium, the Cage campaign has since visited 30 countries with the message that the waste produced by one family over the course of five years from beverage containers – 10,657 bottles and cans – can be replaced by a single SodaStream bottle. When a cage went on display in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2012, Coca-Cola demanded that SodaStream remove its products from the cages and threatened to sue SodaStream. SodaStream responded by dismissing the threats and announcing that it would display the cage outside Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta.[78][79][80][81]
A 30-second television commercial promoting sustainability,[82] showing soda bottles exploding each time a person makes a drink using a SodaStream machine, was banned in the United Kingdom in 2012.[83][84] Clearcast, the organization that approves TV advertising in the UK, explained that they "thought it was a denigration of the bottled drinks market".[85] The same ad, crafted by Alex Bogusky, ran in the United States, Sweden, Australia, and other countries. An appeal by SodaStream to reverse Clearcast's decision to censor the commercial was rejected.[86][87][88] A similar advertisement, which featured a pair of Coca-Cola and Pepsi deliverymen reacting to the exploding bottles, was expected to air during Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013, but was rejected by CBS for its direct references to Coke and Pepsi. The previous SodaStream ad was shown in its place.[89] SodaStream CEO said "The banned ad was a win because of the quality as well as the quantity of the exposure we received".[90]
Production facilities[edit]
SodaStream has 13 production facilities worldwide. From 2016, SodaStream's principal manufacturing facility is in Idan HaNegev Industrial Park north of Beersheba, Israel. The plant provides employment for around 1,400 workers, many of them Negev Bedouins.[91] The cornerstone for the plant was laid in 2011, it opened in 2015.[8][92][93] An additional plant, which began operating in 2011 in Ashkelon, produces SodaStream syrups and flavours. Another plant operated in the Alon Tavor industrial zone near the Israeli city of Afula, between 2011 and 2015, but was closed once the Idan HaNegev facility was opened.
In Europe, the company employs 250 people, in two main sites; at SodaStream's European commercial and logistics center, which is located in Rijen, Netherlands and at a manufacturing facility in Limburg an der Lahn, Germany. SodaStream's US headquarters is at Mount Laurel, New Jersey.[94]
Controversy[edit]
As part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) activist campaign launched in 2005 to pressure Israel to end the occupation of, among other places, the West Bank,[95] SodaStream has been criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the Mishor Adumim industrial zone in the West Bank.[96][97][98][99]
According to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, the Mishor Adumim factory was built on land taken from five Palestinian towns and two Bedouin tribes evicted by the Israeli army.[100][99]
The European Union's highest court ruled in 2010 that SodaStream was not entitled to claim a "Made in Israel" exemption from EU customs payments for products manufactured in the West Bank because Israeli settlements in the West Bank are outside the territorial scope of the EC-Israel Agreement.[101][102][103][104]
In January 2014, Oxfam accepted the resignation of Scarlett Johansson, an American actress who is half Jewish, as ambassador for that organisation, a role she had held for eight years, after she became a brand ambassador for SodaStream. Oxfam has stated that "businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support"[105] and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law.[106] Johansson reportedly resigned because of "a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement".[105] In her statement she described SodaStream as "not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between Israel and Palestine, supporting neighbours working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights."[105] SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum has also accused Oxfam of supporting the BDS movement against Israel as a whole, a charge Oxfam denied, saying that "this is about trade from the settlements" and specific to settlements outside Israel's pre-1967 border.[107][108] which Oxfam states, due to their location, pose an obstacle to any future two-state solution.[108]
Norway, Sweden and Finland have boycotted SodaStream products from the Mishor Adumim factory.[citation needed] According to Birnbaum, the boycott had no impact on the growth rate of SodaStream, and he said, all SodaStream products sold in Norway, Sweden and Finland are manufactured in China.[108]
In January 2014 a Paris court ruled that Association France Palestine Solidarité (AFPS), a group campaigning to remove SodaStream from stores, must compensate SodaStream €6500 because the group falsely claimed the products are sold "illegally and fraudulently" due to their use of the "Made in Israel" label while being partly manufactured in the West Bank.[109]
Human Rights Watch stated that "It is impossible to ignore the Israeli system of unlawful discrimination, land confiscation, natural resource theft, and forced displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, where SodaStream is located".[10][110][111] The United Church of Canada launched a campaign to boycott SodaStream products manufactured in the West Bank.[112]
In July 2014, UK department store John Lewis removed all SodaStream products from its stores, amidst growing BDS pressure and declining sales. Its Oxford Street, London store has been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of SodaStream products. In July 2014, after two years of weekly BDS protests, SodaStream also closed its Brighton store.[113]
Birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical. "We don't take sides in this conflict. He described the factory as "building bridges between us and the Palestinian population, and we provide our Palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits".[114] SodaStream employs 500 West Bank Palestinians.[115] Addressing the location of SodaStream's Ma'ale Adumim plant, Birnbaum said "we're here for historical reasons." The choice was made by company founder Peter Weissburgh, back in the 1990s, long before SodaStream was taken over by the current owners, who appointed Birnbaum in 2007.[116] Birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it: "We will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political agenda...I just can't see how it would help the cause of the Palestinians if we fired them."[116]
Supporters of the factory cite the West Bank's high unemployment rate and low GDP as evidence the jobs are badly needed. Opponents have argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements do not outweigh the effect the Israeli presence has on the Palestinian economy.[100] Others have argued that SodaStream is exploiting local cheap labour.[117][118] Workers' incomes at the factory are substantially above the 1450 shekel/month Palestinian Authority minimum wage.[108]
All but one of the Palestinian employees interviewed by The Christian Science Monitor supported Johansson's stance and opposed a boycott of SodaStream, stating that a boycott would only hurt them.[95] One Palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for SodaStream and felt like a "slave" working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day.[95] Another Palestinian employee interviewed by Reuters reported that: "Most of the managers are Israeli, and West Bank employees feel they can't ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced."[95][119]
In December 2014, Harvard University Dining Services halted SodaStream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society.[120] A few days later, however, Harvard's President Drew Faust reversed the decision, claiming she had not been aware of it in the first place.[121]
When French host Cyril Hanouna aired a homophobic prank on French TV in May 2017, SodaStream first refused to stop advertising and supporting Hanouna's program,[122] but eventually decided to withdraw its advertising.[123]
Firing of Palestinian workers[edit]
In July 2014, Sodastream fired 60 Palestinian workers after they complained about not receiving sufficient food to break Ramadan fasts during night shifts (the company does not permit employees to bring their own food because the plant follows Jewish dietary restrictions) and called a wildcat strike.[124] The workers were fired after receiving due process hearings, and were given severance pay.[124]
SodaStream announced that its factory in Ma'ale Adumim would be closed by the end of 2016 in order to save $9 million in production costs. The plant's operations will be transferred to a new factory in Lehavim, where it will reportedly "employ a significant number of Bedouin Arabs."[125] The move laid off 500 Palestinian workers, although 74 Palestinian workers moved with SodaStream when it relocated. However, the Israeli government refused to renew the Palestinians' work permits. SodaStream protested the government decision.[13]
Some news sources reported that SodaStream blamed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) for the closing of its plant.[12] Mahmoud Nawajaa, the BDS coordinator in Ramallah, called the loss of Palestinian jobs at SodaStream "part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation."[13] However, SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum blamed Benjamin Netanyahu for the Palestinian job losses. According to Birnbaum, all of the Palestinian employees had passed Israeli security clearance, but were nevertheless denied permits to work after Netanyahu intervened. Birnbaum claims that Netanyahu wanted the Palestinians fired so he could then blame BDS. Netanyahu’s office denied Birnbaum's claims.[126]

SodaStream International Ltd. (NASDAQ: SODA) is an Israeli drinks company best known as the maker of the consumer home carbonation product of the same name.[2][3] The device, like a soda syphon, carbonates water by adding carbon dioxide from a pressurized cylinder to create soda water (or carbonated water) to drink. The company also sells more than 100 types of concentrated syrups and flavourings to make carbonated drinks.[4][5][6]
The company was founded in 1903 in England. After the company merged with Soda-Club in 1998, it was relaunched with an emphasis on healthier drinks. It went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010. SodaStream is headquartered in Lod, Israel[7] and has 13 production plants.
Until 2015 its principal manufacturing facility was located in the Mishor Adumim industrial park in the West Bank, creating controversy and a boycott campaign.[8][9][10] In October 2015, SodaStream closed its factory in Ma'ale Adumim, and moved to a new facility in Lehavim,[11] laying off more than 500 Palestinian workers.[12] While SodaStream tried to retain some of its Palestinian employees, the Israeli government denied them permits.[13]

Product[edit]
The SodaStream drinksmaker is a device that forces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas (stored under pressure in a cylinder) into water, making it fizzy. The product includes a machine, a carbon dioxide cylinder, and one or more reusable beverage bottles. The bottle, filled with water, is threaded onto the machine, and with a button push or two, compressed CO2 from the cylinder is injected, creating carbonated water. Varieties of concentrated syrups are available, to create regular or diet soft drinks by adding a small amount of concentrate to the bottle after carbonation.
Different flavours are created by adding fruit-flavoured concentrates. During its heyday, several famous brands were available in SodaStream concentrate form including Tizer, Fanta, Sunkist and Irn-Bru.[14] SodaStream also offers diet concentrates sweetened with Splenda, and is used as much for plain sparkling water as for soft drinks. SodaStream and Kraft Foods entered into a partnership in January 2012 involving the use of the Crystal Light and Country Time brand flavours with the SodaStream home carbonation system. In July of the same year, the two companies expanded their partnership to include the Kool-Aid flavour line.[15] In 2013, SodaStream partnered with Ocean Spray to market three Ocean Spray flavours for use with the SodaStream home soda maker.[16]
In February 2013, SodaStream and Samsung announced that Samsung refrigerators with built-in SodaStream sparkling water dispensers would be available in the United States beginning in April.[17][18]
Excluding the purchase price of the machine, typical cost to the end user (2015, United States dollars) is 25 cents per litre of carbonated water generated[20] plus another 50 cents per litre for the soda syrup.[22] Pricing in other countries may vary.
This often renders SodaStream drinks more expensive than pre-mixed store brand colas,[24] presumably due to the price of soda syrup in small retail quantities.
History[edit]
The forerunner of the machine, the "Apparatus for aerating liquids",[25] was created in 1903 by Guy Hugh Gilbey of the London gin distillers, W & A Gilbey Ltd.,[14] and was sold to the upper classes (including the royal household).[5] Flavoured concentrates such as cherry ciderette and sarsaparilla, were introduced in the 1920s, along with commercial carbonation machines,[3][5] and the first machine for home carbonation of drinks was produced in 1955.[14] The SodaStream was originally sold in the UK, and later spread to other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.
SodaStream machines were popular during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK, and are associated with nostalgia for that period.[5][6] Their slogan, "Get busy with the fizzy", started as an advertising jingle in 1979 and proved so popular that they added it to their logo. The slogan was initially dropped in 1996 after 17 years,[26] but was reinstated in 2010 along with a new marketing campaign in the UK.[27]
In 1985, after various changes of ownership, SodaStream became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes, although it operated as an autonomous business within the group.[14] In 1998, SodaStream was bought by Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh, who from 1978 to 1991 had been Israel's exclusive distributor for SodaStream, creating the world's largest home carbonation systems supplier.[3][28] In 2003 Soda-Club closed the SodaStream factory in Peterborough, moving the company's gas cylinder refilling and refurbishment department to Germany.[29] Under the ownership of Soda-Club, the brand has been relaunched in many markets, with new machines and new flavours available in 41 countries.[30] In 2012, SodaStream teamed with Yves Béhar to introduce SodaStream Source, a line of soda machines designed with a special emphasis on sustainability.[31][32] Béhar's design earned SodaStream a Good Housekeeping Institute seal of approval in 2013.[33]
2010 NASDAQ IPO[edit]
SodaStream International Ltd. went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010.[34] The stock offering was jointly led by J.P. Morgan Securities and Deutsche Bank Securities.[35] At the time, the IPO was the eighth largest for an Israeli company on the NASDAQ[36] and during the year 2010 one of the top-performing IPOs generally.[37][38] To celebrate SodaStream's listing on the NASDAQ, CEO Daniel Birnbaum was invited to ring the exchange's closing bell on 3 November 2010.[39] By August 2011, SodaStream's market cap had risen from $367 million to $1.46 billion.[40][41] During 2012, the stock experienced aggressive growth, with earnings per share growing 57%. In June 2013, Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist incorrectly predicted a $2 billion Pepsi takeover of SodaStream, sending SODA stock higher before the rumours were promptly debunked by PepsiCo.[42]
Analysts had expected another 27% growth in 2013 with earnings projected to grow 30% over the next 5 years.[43] 2013's actual net earnings were down relative to 2012 despite an increase in sales; in 2014, the company's stock dropped to its lowest value since 2012. Barclays PLC analyst David Kaplan cited U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's warnings about the economic effects of boycotts and the company's failure to clarify the reasons for missed earning targets as causes for the drop.[44]
In October 2014, SodaStream announced its revenue for 2014 was expected to decline to $562.7 million, a 9% decrease from the previous year while a report by Zacks Equity Research stated that net income for 2014 is expected to be 42% lower than in 2013. Zacks Equity Research cited declining sales in the United States, where an increasing number of consumers are choosing "more natural, less caloric and water based beverages" as opposed to traditional carbonated soft drinks.
Sales[edit]
Some 20% of households in Sweden owned SodaStream machines as of 2010.[45] In January 2011, the company marked the sale of its millionth soda maker in the country.[46] Europe accounts for 52% of SodaStream's sales.[47]
SodaStream has been a publicly traded company since 2010.[48] Since May 2012, SodaStream has been sold in over 2,900 Walmart locations in the United States. In June equity research firm Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. stated that SodaStream's machines were selling out at Walmart.[49][50] SodaStream's U.S. sales grew from US$4.4 million in 2007 to $40 million in 2011.[51] Despite record sales, profit margins are declining. SodaStream's estimated 2013 net income ($41.5 million on an annual revenue of $562 million in 2013, compared to 2012's $43.86 million of net income on $436.32 million of revenue) fell short of targets and investor expectations.[52] Sodastream also sells its product at most Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Gas canisters[edit]
The SodaStream counter-top beverage carbonators are typically bundled with a 14.5 ounce proprietary CO2 cylinder, which the company claims to be able to carbonate 60 litres (13 imp gal; 16 US gal) of water. A few selected models can also accept a 33-ounce cylinder advertised as carbonating 130 litres (29 imp gal; 34 US gal) of water. According to the company, when a cylinder is empty, it must be returned to a SodaStream reseller for replacement, however there are ample videos and descriptions online of methods whereby consumers learn how to refill the canisters on their own.[53]
SodaStream does not sell the CO2 canisters to consumers, but instead "licenses" them and expressly limits how they can be used in their User License Certificate.[54] Local CO2 vendors are generally not permitted to refill Sodastream canisters ("carbonators"), which include a proprietary valve designed to prevent refilling.[55]
According to SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum, "We created a razor and a razor-blade business model. The razor is obviously the soda maker and we have three blades: the CO2 refills, the flavour syrups, and the bottles. So it's not a one-time sale – the blades are our future revenue stream. We acquire users, build our installed base, and we cultivate those users for life."[56]
In Sweden in 1984, carbonic acid supplier Sydbrand, primarily a supplier of fire equipment, was sued successfully by SodaStream for trademark infringement for refilling SodaStream-labelled CO2 canisters.[57] In 2006, SodaStream lost a suit against the resale of its Alco2jet brand canisters on eBay on the grounds that the canisters were only lent, not sold.[58]
Syrups and concentrates[edit]




SodaStream machine with different syrup packs


SodaStream advertises "100 flavours of the world", an assortment of syrups and concentrates which include "cola", "natural", "clear", "green tea", "ice tea", "isotonic", fruit, "local", "mixers" and "energy" drinks.[59] The concentrates are packaged as 500 ml bottles in which one capful is enough to flavour one litre of soda; 0.5 litre of concentrate makes 12 litre of soda. It is not necessary to add flavours to the carbonated water, it is simply an option.
SodaStream can only carbonate water, one litre at a time, in the supplied bottle – the concentrates are added after carbonated water is removed from the machine. This poses a limitation if one wishes to carbonate wine or fresh fruit juices.[60]
There are no restrictions on obtaining soda syrup from competing vendors. Restaurant-standard 20 litre or 4.2 imperial gallons (5.0 US gal) "bag in box" soda fountain syrups are one means to obtain name-brand soda instead of SodaStream's generic brand. As these are not concentrates, the standard mix is five parts carbonated water to one part syrup. Fountain syrups are available from vendors such as Sam's Club in the United States or from restaurant supply houses.
Users have experimented with various alternative flavours and syrups, including snow cone syrup, concentrates from real fruit juices, powdered drink mixes and home-made or supermarket concoctions.[61] A few small independent vendors offer speciality flavours such as soft drink syrups with real cane sugar.[62] A modern version of the "Hires Root Beer kit" unsweetened concentrate is distributed by the Hires Big H drive-in restaurant chain,[63] but its users must add both sugar and carbonated water. Other manufacturers have tried to make syrups that are more compatible with SodaStream, such as Rio, which makes both a concentrated version that can be sweetened with sugar or other sweeteners, or a fully sweetened version that is ready to use. The use of these syrups has been met with mixed reviews, thought their popularity seems to have increased since SodaStream changed their flavor offerings and formulation.[64]
Environmental marketing[edit]
In its marketing, the company focuses on environmental attractiveness of using tap water and returnable gas cylinders.[4] SodaStream has been involved in environmental projects, including waste reduction, beach cleanup and reforestation.[65]
Americans alone dispose of 130 billion bottles and cans every year,[66] and 340 billion beverage bottles and cans are not recycled every year worldwide.[67] According to SodaStream, use of home carbonation systems reduces packaging waste from bottles and cans, and the pollution caused by the transport of bottled drinks.[68] According to an analysis by Carbon Trust, SodaStream is 75 per cent less greenhouse gas-intensive than generic colas sold in plastic (PET) bottles in the UK.[69]
In 2011, SodaStream partnered with the Israel Union for Environmental Defense to launch an initiative promoting waste reduction and an improvement in the quality of tap water.[70]> Also in 2011, SodaStream launched a campaign with Erin O'Connor to raise awareness to the effects of plastic bottle waste on the environment.[71] As part of the company's support for Climate Week, in 2012 SodaStream donated £1,000 to a school in Crediton, Devon in the United Kingdom to fund an educational beach cleaning initiative.[72][73] SodaStream partnered with Trees for the Future in 2012 to launch the Replant Our Planet initiative: for each home beverage carbonation system sold from its Rethink Your Soda product line, SodaStream committed to planting hundreds of thousands of trees in Brazil.[74][75] SodaStream Italy and the Municipality of Venice partnered in 2012 to organize Join the Stream: fight the bottle, a cleanup initiative with its starting point at the Lido di Venezia.[76] Actress Rosario Dawson launched the first annual Unbottle the World Day in New York City in July 2012. The campaign, initiated by SodaStream to raise awareness to the impact of cans and plastic bottles on the environment, calls on the United Nations to designate one day of the year a "Bottle Free Day".[77]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
In 2010 SodaStream launched an international campaign to raise awareness of bottle and can consumption. The campaign involves the display of 9-cubic-metre cages in various countries, each containing 10,657 empty bottles and cans. Begun in Belgium, the Cage campaign has since visited 30 countries with the message that the waste produced by one family over the course of five years from beverage containers – 10,657 bottles and cans – can be replaced by a single SodaStream bottle. When a cage went on display in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2012, Coca-Cola demanded that SodaStream remove its products from the cages and threatened to sue SodaStream. SodaStream responded by dismissing the threats and announcing that it would display the cage outside Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta.[78][79][80][81]
A 30-second television commercial promoting sustainability,[82] showing soda bottles exploding each time a person makes a drink using a SodaStream machine, was banned in the United Kingdom in 2012.[83][84] Clearcast, the organization that approves TV advertising in the UK, explained that they "thought it was a denigration of the bottled drinks market".[85] The same ad, crafted by Alex Bogusky, ran in the United States, Sweden, Australia, and other countries. An appeal by SodaStream to reverse Clearcast's decision to censor the commercial was rejected.[86][87][88] A similar advertisement, which featured a pair of Coca-Cola and Pepsi deliverymen reacting to the exploding bottles, was expected to air during Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013, but was rejected by CBS for its direct references to Coke and Pepsi. The previous SodaStream ad was shown in its place.[89] SodaStream CEO said "The banned ad was a win because of the quality as well as the quantity of the exposure we received".[90]
Production facilities[edit]
SodaStream has 13 production facilities worldwide. From 2016, SodaStream's principal manufacturing facility is in Idan HaNegev Industrial Park north of Beersheba, Israel. The plant provides employment for around 1,400 workers, many of them Negev Bedouins.[91] The cornerstone for the plant was laid in 2011, it opened in 2015.[8][92][93] An additional plant, which began operating in 2011 in Ashkelon, produces SodaStream syrups and flavours. Another plant operated in the Alon Tavor industrial zone near the Israeli city of Afula, between 2011 and 2015, but was closed once the Idan HaNegev facility was opened.
In Europe, the company employs 250 people, in two main sites; at SodaStream's European commercial and logistics center, which is located in Rijen, Netherlands and at a manufacturing facility in Limburg an der Lahn, Germany. SodaStream's US headquarters is at Mount Laurel, New Jersey.[94]
Controversy[edit]
As part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) activist campaign launched in 2005 to pressure Israel to end the occupation of, among other places, the West Bank,[95] SodaStream has been criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the Mishor Adumim industrial zone in the West Bank.[96][97][98][99]
According to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, the Mishor Adumim factory was built on land taken from five Palestinian towns and two Bedouin tribes evicted by the Israeli army.[100][99]
The European Union's highest court ruled in 2010 that SodaStream was not entitled to claim a "Made in Israel" exemption from EU customs payments for products manufactured in the West Bank because Israeli settlements in the West Bank are outside the territorial scope of the EC-Israel Agreement.[101][102][103][104]
In January 2014, Oxfam accepted the resignation of Scarlett Johansson, an American actress who is half Jewish, as ambassador for that organisation, a role she had held for eight years, after she became a brand ambassador for SodaStream. Oxfam has stated that "businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support"[105] and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law.[106] Johansson reportedly resigned because of "a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement".[105] In her statement she described SodaStream as "not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between Israel and Palestine, supporting neighbours working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights."[105] SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum has also accused Oxfam of supporting the BDS movement against Israel as a whole, a charge Oxfam denied, saying that "this is about trade from the settlements" and specific to settlements outside Israel's pre-1967 border.[107][108] which Oxfam states, due to their location, pose an obstacle to any future two-state solution.[108]
Norway, Sweden and Finland have boycotted SodaStream products from the Mishor Adumim factory.[citation needed] According to Birnbaum, the boycott had no impact on the growth rate of SodaStream, and he said, all SodaStream products sold in Norway, Sweden and Finland are manufactured in China.[108]
In January 2014 a Paris court ruled that Association France Palestine Solidarité (AFPS), a group campaigning to remove SodaStream from stores, must compensate SodaStream €6500 because the group falsely claimed the products are sold "illegally and fraudulently" due to their use of the "Made in Israel" label while being partly manufactured in the West Bank.[109]
Human Rights Watch stated that "It is impossible to ignore the Israeli system of unlawful discrimination, land confiscation, natural resource theft, and forced displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, where SodaStream is located".[10][110][111] The United Church of Canada launched a campaign to boycott SodaStream products manufactured in the West Bank.[112]
In July 2014, UK department store John Lewis removed all SodaStream products from its stores, amidst growing BDS pressure and declining sales. Its Oxford Street, London store has been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of SodaStream products. In July 2014, after two years of weekly BDS protests, SodaStream also closed its Brighton store.[113]
Birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical. "We don't take sides in this conflict. He described the factory as "building bridges between us and the Palestinian population, and we provide our Palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits".[114] SodaStream employs 500 West Bank Palestinians.[115] Addressing the location of SodaStream's Ma'ale Adumim plant, Birnbaum said "we're here for historical reasons." The choice was made by company founder Peter Weissburgh, back in the 1990s, long before SodaStream was taken over by the current owners, who appointed Birnbaum in 2007.[116] Birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it: "We will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political agenda...I just can't see how it would help the cause of the Palestinians if we fired them."[116]
Supporters of the factory cite the West Bank's high unemployment rate and low GDP as evidence the jobs are badly needed. Opponents have argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements do not outweigh the effect the Israeli presence has on the Palestinian economy.[100] Others have argued that SodaStream is exploiting local cheap labour.[117][118] Workers' incomes at the factory are substantially above the 1450 shekel/month Palestinian Authority minimum wage.[108]
All but one of the Palestinian employees interviewed by The Christian Science Monitor supported Johansson's stance and opposed a boycott of SodaStream, stating that a boycott would only hurt them.[95] One Palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for SodaStream and felt like a "slave" working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day.[95] Another Palestinian employee interviewed by Reuters reported that: "Most of the managers are Israeli, and West Bank employees feel they can't ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced."[95][119]
In December 2014, Harvard University Dining Services halted SodaStream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society.[120] A few days later, however, Harvard's President Drew Faust reversed the decision, claiming she had not been aware of it in the first place.[121]
When French host Cyril Hanouna aired a homophobic prank on French TV in May 2017, SodaStream first refused to stop advertising and supporting Hanouna's program,[122] but eventually decided to withdraw its advertising.[123]
Firing of Palestinian workers[edit]
In July 2014, Sodastream fired 60 Palestinian workers after they complained about not receiving sufficient food to break Ramadan fasts during night shifts (the company does not permit employees to bring their own food because the plant follows Jewish dietary restrictions) and called a wildcat strike.[124] The workers were fired after receiving due process hearings, and were given severance pay.[124]
SodaStream announced that its factory in Ma'ale Adumim would be closed by the end of 2016 in order to save $9 million in production costs. The plant's operations will be transferred to a new factory in Lehavim, where it will reportedly "employ a significant number of Bedouin Arabs."[125] The move laid off 500 Palestinian workers, although 74 Palestinian workers moved with SodaStream when it relocated. However, the Israeli government refused to renew the Palestinians' work permits. SodaStream protested the government decision.[13]
Some news sources reported that SodaStream blamed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) for the closing of its plant.[12] Mahmoud Nawajaa, the BDS coordinator in Ramallah, called the loss of Palestinian jobs at SodaStream "part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation."[13] However, SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum blamed Benjamin Netanyahu for the Palestinian job losses. According to Birnbaum, all of the Palestinian employees had passed Israeli security clearance, but were nevertheless denied permits to work after Netanyahu intervened. Birnbaum claims that Netanyahu wanted the Palestinians fired so he could then blame BDS. Netanyahu’s office denied Birnbaum's claims.[126]

   News  SodaStream International Ltd (SODA): Is Brand Loyalty Dead?    Published on June 13, 2013 at 12:26 pm by  
                                The Motley Fool
                                  in News         Page 1 of 2Next &gt&gtSee All           “I’ll tell you why I like the cigarette business. It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It’s addictive. And there’s fantastic brand loyalty.” – Warren Buffett In 2012 Ernst and Young released a study that found that consumers in developed markets were significantly less likely to make purchasing decisions based on brand loyalty. Younger generations of consumers were more willing to switch brands than their previous generation counterparts and were more likely to compare different product offerings online to find the best value. This change in the way consumers behave could pose a potential threat to many existing businesses and pave the way for new competitors to emerge, creating new opportunities in what were once thought to be dead industries. SodaStream International Ltd (NASDAQ:SODA) is one example of a company that could potentially disrupt the status quo. While not a beverage maker in the traditional sense, SodaStream sells home soda-making kits that allow consumers to make soft drinks themselves. The consumer buys a machine that carbonates water as well as bottles of soda concentrate that are used to flavor the water to give it its soda taste. While Sodastream International Ltd (NASDAQ:SODA) is still a minor player in the beverage industry it is gaining traction. Revenues were up this quarter by 33.9% year over year, with its primary growth drivers being the Americas and Western Europe. Some feared that Sodastream International Ltd (NASDAQ:SODA) was a fad product that would die out over time, but the company has shown itself to be consistently reliable with steady growth rates in the sale of both machines and consumables. Additionally the company found that 70% of Sodastream International Ltd (NASDAQ:SODA) owners were still using their product after one year, and of those active users over 80% were using their machine at least once a week. This shows that Sodastream International Ltd (NASDAQ:SODA) can maintain their razor/razor-blade model of selling consumers the machine first, and then continually selling them the soda concentrate to make the drinks. While SodaStream’s growth is impressive the company is not without its risks. For starters there is always the threat that a major competitor may jump into the market. PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) or The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) could come out with their own machine at any time with very little barrier to entry and disrupt SodaStream’s business entirely. Because Coca-Cola or Pepsi could use their own concentrates SodaStream would have a tough time competing. Sodastream International Ltd (NASDAQ:SODA) also has to worry about a decline in soft-drink sales altogether. Since 2005, carbonated beverage sales have been declining continually and this could impact SodaStream negatively. SodaStream may be faced with the challenge of taking a larger share out of an increasingly smaller and smaller market. Because SodaStream’s growth is tied primarily to the U.S. the company has to worry about a slowdown in U.S. sales growth. As the company matures it will become increasingly more difficult to grow sales and earnings at rate consistent with its past. While the company still looks cheap at under 30 times trailing twelve-month earnings, and about 20 times foreword earnings, investors should look out for slowing growth rates. The company appears undervalued at today’s prices but given the rise in price that shares saw over recent months it may be prudent for investors to wait for a pullback before accumulating shares. Also benefiting from this change in consumer trends is COTT Corporation (USA) (NYSE:COT). Cott produces and distributes private label soft drinks throughout North America and Europe, and owns several brands of beverages including the non-North American version of RC Cola. While COTT does have some interesting opportunities opening up it is unlikely that it will benefit much from these changes. For starters Cott Corporation (USA) (NYSE:COT) does not offer a compelling reason to switch beverage brands for most of their products. Consumers are not likely to switch from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) or PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) to RC Cola merely for cost savings, and the brands behind any successful private label product that they manufacture are likely to be bought out by either Pepsi or Coke. Unlike Sodastream International Ltd (NASDAQ:SODA), which offers several benefits to consumers including lower calorie drinks, environmentally friendly products, and convenience, Cott Corporation (USA) (NYSE:COT) has no advantages besides offering a marginally lower price than its name brand competitors. For this reason Cott Corporation’s growth could be limited. One area in particular, however, where Cott Corporation (USA) (NYSE:COT) could benefit is oddly enough in SodaStream’s growth. Sodastream International Ltd (NASDAQ:SODA) announced in March a deal with Cott Corporation that would allow Cott to manufacture SodaStream flavor concentrates in the U.S. This deal will be great for Cott as it gives the company another product that will likely continue growing for years to come. But even with this deal, the business does not look great. For starters the company has low profit margins, $600 million in debt (more than half its market cap!), and inconsistent earnings. While the company’s free cash flow numbers look slightly better than its earnings and the company does offer a solid 2.8% yield, I’m staying away. There are much better companies to invest in with significantly better business models. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) are among the first to come to mind. Coca-Cola is among the most iconic brands. The name is the second most recognized term around the world after the word “okay.” But can Coke’s brand overcome the change in consumer trends that are currently underway? According to the 2012 Ernst and Young report, while western consumers are becoming increasingly less loyal to particular names, emerging market consumers are becoming more likely to make their purchasing decisions based on a product’s brand. This helps explain the growth of products such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in emerging markets. While per capita consumption of Coca-Cola products has fallen from 2002 to 2012 in the U.S., worldwide consumption has increased during that same period of time.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Top Ranked Momentum Stocks to Buy for June 23rd 

SodaStream (SODA) Climbs 6%, Should You Buy? 


	Trouble at Sodastream International Ltd (NASDAQ: SODA) Tuesday drove up the shares of a competitor in the marketplace for home dispensers of carbonated beverages.

Keurig Green Mountain Inc (NASDAQ: GMCR), best known for its coffee-brewing machines that rely on branded single-serve packets of coffee, in February signed a 10-year agreement with The Coca-Cola Company to develop at-home soda machines.

	Coca-Cola holds a 16 percent stake in Keurig and is its largest shareholder.

	Although the Keurig soda project has yet to launch, Keurig shares jumped more than 5 percent after Sodastream warned of weak third-quarter results because the concept of home-based dispensers appeared to be flopping.

	"While we were successful over the last few years in establishing a solid base of repeat users in the U.S., we have not succeeded in attracting new consumers to our home carbonation system at the rate we believe should be achieved," Sodastream Chief Executive Daniel Birnbaum said.

	Keurig plans to launch its broadly similar Keurig cold beverage system which will exclusively feature Coca-Cola-branded single serve, pod-based cold beverages.

	At the same time, Sodastream plans "a strategic shift" for its brand towards health and wellness market in the United States. "We believe this message will resonate more strongly with consumers," Birnbaum said.

	Sodastream fell more than 20 percent to $21.71 per share; Keurig changed hands recently at $138.93 per share, up 4.3 percent.
