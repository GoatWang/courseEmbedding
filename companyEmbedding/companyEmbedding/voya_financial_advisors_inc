Voya Financial Advisors, Inc. Key Developments

Voya Financial Advisors Launches New Practice Management Tool to Support Advisor Business Growth
Nov 14 16
Voya Financial, Inc. announced that its retail broker-dealer and registered investment adviser Voya Financial Advisors, Inc., has launched its Business Builder tool, the latest addition to the firm's expanding suite of practice management resources. The new tool, a data-driven modeling and forecasting system, will allow advisors to set and monitor the progress of business growth goals, helping drive overall success. With a targeted focus on offering advisors the latest in tools and training, Voya Financial Advisors (VFA) has been evolving its network in the past year while making significant investments in new resources, technology enhancements and expanded advisory programs. This has helped the firm grow annual advisory sales by 30% during 2015 and drive annual recruiting Assets under Management (AUM) up 115% through the third quarter of 2016. The Business Builder tool was designed to help advisors who serve both retail clients and those serving participants in school, government and nonprofit employer-sponsored retirement plans. The tool will assist all advisors in better managing overall practice models and in aiding the financial and retirement goals of clients. Advisors primarily benefit from the tool's ability to fit specific business models, providing a comprehensive view of overall Gross Dealer Concession (GDC), sales, and net new assets across multiple product categories, which enables a more efficient estimate of growth projections. Building on the strong network of retirement advisors who work in the Tax-Exempt Market (TEM) space, the tool also provides capabilities for adjustments to better fit the unique TEM business model. Retail-focused advisors will now also have access to an established retirement plan market to better suit their individual needs.


Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Fines Eight Firms a Total of $6.2 million for Supervisory Failures Related to Variable Annuity L-Shares
Nov 2 16
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that it has fined eight firms, including VOYA Financial Advisors, five broker-dealer subsidiaries of Cetera Financial Group, Kestra Investment Services, LLC, and FTB Advisors, Inc., a total of $6.2 million for failing to supervise sales of variable annuities (VAs). FINRA also ordered five of the firms to pay more than $6 million to customers who purchased L-share variable annuities with potentially incompatible, complex and expensive long-term minimum-income and withdrawal riders. FINRA imposed sanctions against the firms as: VOYA Financial Advisors Inc. was fined $2.75 million, Cetera Advisor Networks LLC was fined $750,000, Cetera Financial Specialists LLC was fined $350,000, First Allied Securities, Inc. was fined $950,000, Summit Brokerage Services, Inc. was fined $500,000, VSR Financial Services, Inc. was fined $400,000, Kestra Investment Services, LLC was fined $475,000 and FTB Advisors, Inc. was fined $250,000. FINRA ordered the firms to pay the to investors as: Voya was ordered to pay at least $1.8 million to customers in this category and Cetera Advisors Networks, First Allied, Summit Brokerage Services and VSR were collectively ordered to pay customers at least $4.5 million. The L-share VAs at the heart of this action are complex investment products combining insurance and security features designed for short-term investors willing to pay higher fees in exchange for shorter surrender periods. L-shares also had the potential to pay greater compensation to the firms and registered representatives than more traditional share classes. Each of the firms in this action lacked an adequate system to supervise variable annuities with multiple share classes, and failed to provide its registered representatives and principals with reasonable guidance regarding the narrow class of customers for whom the costs and features of L-share variable annuities were suitable. These failures were compounded by the fact that the short-surrender L-Shares were often sold with complex and expensive guaranteed income and withdrawal riders that provided benefits only over longer holding periods. These actions also included additional violations by Voya, Cetera Advisors Networks, Cetera Financial Specialists and VSR for failure to monitor rates of variable annuity exchanges at their respective firms.

WINDSOR, Conn., June 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE:   VOYA), announced today that it has hired Jeff Cimini to lead the company's Retirement Product organization.

I look forward to working with Jeff as we continue to help all Americans become financially and emotionally ready to retire."

His background includes more than 20 years with Fidelity Investments, where he held roles of increasing responsibility and leadership across the defined contribution marketplace.  Jeff's experience includes stable value portfolio management, fund analysis, investment consulting and sales, consultant relations, defined contribution investment only (DCIO) sales and investment consulting services.  In addition to retirement, Cimini managed sales and distribution for the Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company division and served as president of its three life insurance entities.
"Voya is on a transformational journey in an industry that serves an important cause and is positioned for significant growth," said Cimini.  "I'm excited to be joining a team that is focused on helping Americans retire better and that demonstrates this commitment with a passion equal to mine."  
Cimini holds a bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a Masters in finance from Boston College.

Overview+



What is an annuity? 
An annuity is an insurance product that pays you periodic income payments in exchange for your premium payment. It can be used as part of your overall retirement strategy. Depending on the type of annuity, it may help you grow your retirement savings, protect your savings from loss, and offer death benefits to protect your beneficiaries. 




How to choose an annuity
Make your choice based on how your needs match up to the features of the annuity. Do you need to grow your retirement savings or are you concerned with losing principal? Or both? Do you need income that starts now or in the future? Do you want to leave a legacy to your heirs? These are some of the questions to ask yourself to determine which annuity might work for you. 




Why Voya?
Voya Financial is ready to help Americans build a secure financial future—one person, one family, one institution at a time. We are ready to make a difference—to deliver financial solutions to help all Americans become retirement ready.

Life insurance products are issued by ReliaStar Life Insurance Company of New York (Woodbury, NY) and Security Life of Denver Insurance Company (Denver, CO). Variable universal life insurance products are distributed by Voya America Equities, Inc. Within the state of New York, only ReliaStar Life Insurance Company of New York is admitted and it's products issued. All are members of the Voya® family of companies.
All guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims paying ability of the issuing insurance company, who is solely responsible for all obligations under its policies. 





Policy loans and partial withdrawals may vary by state, may generate an income tax liability, reduce available surrender value and reduce the death benefit, or cause the policy to lapse.
1Income tax free distributions are usually achieved by withdrawing to the cost basis (usually premiums paid), then using policy loans. This assumes the policy qualifies as life insurance, is not a modified endowment contract, is not lapsed or surrendered with an outstanding loan. Individual tax results may vary. You should consult your attorney or other tax advisor.

WINDSOR, Conn., June 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE:   VOYA), announced today that it has hired Jeff Cimini to lead the company's Retirement Product organization.








Cimini will oversee the team responsible for all aspects of the centralized retirement product functions, including product management, development, strategy, pricing, competitive intelligence, Voya Institutional Trust Company, as well as the advisory services programs that Voya offers to plan sponsors and their participants.  Cimini and the team will expand Voya's efforts to deliver value-focused solutions that drive positive retirement outcomes.
Cimini will be based in Voya's Windsor, Connecticut office.  He will be a member of the Retirement leadership team and report to CEO of Retirement Charlie Nelson, effective July 3.
"As we look to advance outcomes for plan sponsors and participants, we must continue to develop innovative solutions that deliver value and address a broad range of financial wellness needs," said Nelson.  "Jeff has extensive knowledge and experience across many areas of the 401(k) market, including investments, product development, sales and strategy.  He brings an accomplished, client-focused perspective to Voya with a successful track record managing high-performing teams. I look forward to working with Jeff as we continue to help all Americans become financially and emotionally ready to retire."  
Most recently, Cimini was head of strategy for TIAA's Institutional Financial Services division, and also served as head of sales and client services for TIAA's select institutional clients.  Previously, he was head of Personal Retirement for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. His background includes more than 20 years with Fidelity Investments, where he held roles of increasing responsibility and leadership across the defined contribution marketplace.  Jeff's experience includes stable value portfolio management, fund analysis, investment consulting and sales, consultant relations, defined contribution investment only (DCIO) sales and investment consulting services.  In addition to retirement, Cimini managed sales and distribution for the Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company division and served as president of its three life insurance entities.
"Voya is on a transformational journey in an industry that serves an important cause and is positioned for significant growth," said Cimini.  "I'm excited to be joining a team that is focused on helping Americans retire better and that demonstrates this commitment with a passion equal to mine."  
Cimini holds a bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a Masters in finance from Boston College.
Voya, a leading provider of retirement products and services in the U.S., serves approximately 47,000 plan sponsor clients and more than 4.5 million individual retirement plan investors.1 Voya also operates a leading broker-dealer that serves a growing retail market.

As a component of benefits offered to employees, 401k plans are a very popular way to accumulate tax-deferred income and earnings for retirement. 
Employers offer 401k plans as a way to help their employees save for retirement. You choose how much pre-tax income you wish to contribute and that amount is automatically deducted from your paycheck and placed into your account within the 401k plan. Your retirement savings can continue to grow tax-deferred until you make a withdrawal. You do not pay taxes on your salary deferrals or earnings until you take a withdrawal from the plan. Generally, if you take the distribution after age 59½ there is no tax penalty.  
One difference from an IRA is that 401k plans permit higher contribution limits and are only available through your employer.     




Key Features

Because your employer sponsors the 401k plan, there may be other valuable benefits offered in addition to salary deferrals. Check your plan carefully. The following are key features provide a brief overview to assist you:

Optional Participation: Although some plan sponsors automatically enroll employees to promote plan participations, 401k plan participation is still optional. Check with your employer to determine how you can enroll. 
Contribution Rate: You can choose the amount you want to contribute each payroll up to established IRS limits. You will also be permitted to change your contribution rate once you are in the plan.
Your 401k plan contribution comes out of your paycheck on a pre-tax basis which lowers your taxable income for that pay period. (That’s a good thing!) 
Available Investments: You can choose from a variety of investment choices selected by your employer.
Deferred Taxes: Not only do your pre-tax contributions help lower your taxable income each pay period, but all earnings on your contributions grow tax deferred. Note: Some plans offer a Roth 401k, which permit savings on an after tax basis.  
You will not be taxed on either the contributions or earnings until you make a withdrawal. 
Optional Employer Match: To provide an extra boost to retirement savings, many employers match a percentage of an employee’s contribution which will be given to the employee once she is vested. 
Accessing Funds During Employment: Loans—As an optional feature your employer may permit you to borrow against your plan account up to specified IRS limits. Hardship Withdrawals—Understanding that certain hardships arise, the IRS permits plans to allow distributions for certain hardship reasons. 
Portability: If you leave your job, you can remain in the plan or rollover your 401k funds into an IRA or another 401k.
Support: Your 401k plan provider typically offers many free tools and resources to help you establish savings goals, measure your progress, and to see how financially close you are to meeting your retirement goals.
The 457 and 403b plans are similar to 401k plans, but are typically offered by other types of organizations. The 457 plan is offered to employees of state and local governments. The 403b plan is offered only to the employees of public schools and qualified tax-exempt organizations such as higher-education, churches, tax-exempt hospitals, and charities.
Roth accounts: May also be offered by a plan sponsor under 401k, 403b, or governmental 457b plans. Roth contributions are made after you’ve paid taxes on the income, but qualified distributions may be taken tax-free in retirement.1  



Suitable For




The 401k is a key financial tool for almost anyone trying to save as much as possible for their retirement.  








Eligibility
 



You must be employed by a plan sponsor offering a 401k plan to participate. 
If you leave employment, you will no longer be able to contribute to the plan. 
Some employers will let you keep your savings in their plan after you leave. 
You can always combine all of your old plans into one rollover IRA or in most cases, into the 401k plan offered by your new employer.
Contributions are deducted from your paycheck up to certain IRS-defined annual limits. Contributions can be designated as a specific dollar amount or percentage of your pay. The contributions are taken before taxes, lowering your current income tax bill. You will owe income taxes when you make a withdrawal from the plan. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ are also subject to a 10% IRS early withdrawal penalty, unless an IRS exception applies. 








Additional Details




This material is provided for general and educational purposes only; it is not intended to provide legal, tax or investment advice. All investments are subject to risk. We recommend that you consult an independent legal or financial advisor for specific advice about your individual situation.
The information herein is not intended to be used, and cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties. Taxpayers should seek advice based on their own particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.
1A qualified distribution of designated Roth contributions is excludable from gross income. A qualified distribution is one that occurs at least five years after the year of the participant’s first designated Roth contribution (counting such first year as part of the five) and is made: - On or after the participant’s attainment of age 59½, - On account of the participant’s disability, or - On or after the participant’s death. 
If the distribution is not a qualified distribution, then the accumulated Roth 401k earnings will be subject to tax, and additional taxes may apply. Roth 401k amounts are subject to the same required minimum distribution rules as other contributions made to the 401k plan.

Retirement News Release








 




Voya Financial Launches Wealth Portfolios Product, Expanding Advisory Program


THURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016


WINDSOR, Conn., May 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE: VOYA), announced today that its retail broker-dealer and registered investment advisor Voya Financial Advisors, Inc., has launched the Voya Wealth Portfolios product, the latest addition to its suite of turnkey offerings available on the firm's WealthSolutions wealth management platform. As a result of this new advisory-focused solution, financial advisors affiliated with Voya Financial Advisors now have access to leading fund families and the ability to provide a best-in-class team approach to constructing investment portfolios. This strategy is focused on finding the right asset allocation mix to match a client's individual financial needs and risk tolerance. 
The Voya Wealth Portfolios product supports the firm's ongoing commitment to strengthen its advisory business, which grew by 30 percent during 2015. The new offering also provides an opportunity for advisors to deliver holistic support that can help clients get ready to retire better by planning, investing and protecting their savings. This reinforces Voya's efforts to further expand its advisory business.
"The introduction of Voya Wealth Portfolios provides an added opportunity for our advisors to focus on what matters most — deepening client relationships, building holistic financial plans and running their businesses," said Tom Halloran, president of Voya Financial Advisors. "As a leading broker-dealer and investment advisor in the industry, it's important that we arm our advisors with the right solutions to help their clients plan and feel confident about their future. In doing this, we are also positioning ourselves to be successful in the new regulatory environment while supporting our vision to be America's Retirement Company™."
Voya Wealth Portfolios is a turnkey solution that includes four different series of portfolios that are fully invested in a specific mutual fund company. These fund partners represent four leading brands in the industry with successful track records. Within each of the Voya Wealth Portfolios are five model options that advisors can work with to give them broad flexibility when building an investment portfolio for their clients.  
Advisors who operate with Voya Wealth Portfolios have access to an institutionally recognized sub-advisor known for robust research and investment consulting services. Working together with Voya Financial Advisors, the firm FDx Advisors provides investment and research support to help manage the asset allocation as well as the fiduciary risk in the fund selection for Voya Wealth Portfolios. With an objective of growth by generating interest, capital gains and dividends for individual accounts, each model maintains an appropriate risk level and is adjusted annually in response to changes in the market.
Since its launch, the Voya Wealth Portfolios offering is proving to be popular with advisors — even drawing new advisors to the advisory platform. "We've seen great interest among advisors," commented Andre Robinson, head of advisory services at Voya Financial Advisors. "Working together with FDx and the fund companies, we designed a solution that allows us to move commission-based accounts into advisory accounts with comparable funds. With this approach, portfolios are reviewed by fund managers that our advisors and clients have come to know and trust." 
Voya Wealth Portfolios also allows advisors to better integrate advisory solutions for clients with smaller accounts. Steve Dunlap, president and COO of FolioDynamix, noted, "Our team of research professionals worked closely with hand-picked investment managers to put the most optimal, innovative solution in place for Voya Financial Advisors. The Voya models are constructed and monitored based on risk-tolerance assessments to determine proper asset allocation, enabling advisors to offer a professionally managed advisory account option to investors of any size."
With the broad range of available models, advisors are able to align their clients with the investment portfolio that best suits their needs. "The decisions made with my clients on how to invest their funds may impact nearly every aspect of their lives down the road," noted Joe O'Boyle, a California-based advisor with Voya Financial Advisors. "With so much at stake, it's great to have a solution that can support their personalized goals while offering access to professionals with the extensive experience, tools and resources."  
In support of its expanding advisory business, Voya Financial Advisors also provides a "white glove" services team and suite of resources to assist advisors with all aspects of growing their advisory business, including support with best practices, case consultation, product and technology training, and conversion assistance.
Voya Financial Advisors is an independent broker-dealer and registered investment advisor focused on helping advance the retirement readiness and financial security needs of Americans. For more information, visit www.voyafa.com.
As an industry leader and advocate for greater retirement readiness, Voya Financial is committed to delivering on its vision to be America's Retirement Company™ and its mission to make a secure financial future possible — one person, one family, one institution at a time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
