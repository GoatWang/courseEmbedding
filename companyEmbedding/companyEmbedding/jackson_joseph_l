 Product Description 

The Prophet Joseph Smith was the greatest doctrinal teacher since Jesus Christ. "It is my duty to teach the doctrine," he said, and he preached, wrote, and explained in informal and formal settings what the Lord had revealed to him. Much of his teaching focused on passages from the Bible. In a typical doctrinal sermon or letter he would deal with as many as a dozen passages, citing some merely to demonstrate a point, but discussing others in enlightening detail. This unique book compiles excerpts from newspapers, journals, diaries, and transcripts of sermons, offering the illumination of the Prophet's perspective to increase our understanding of the Bible.
