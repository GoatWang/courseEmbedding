Eastspring - Investment Outlook 2H2016























2H2016 INVESTMENT OUTLOOK
 REASONS FOR OPTIMISM BUT DON’T GO OVERBOARD


Share







overviewFor second half of 2016
Early 2016’s turbulent seas have slowly given way to calmer waters1 albeit with shock waves rippling into the June quarter.
Global, not local, issues seem in the driver’s seat for much of the coming six months. Adding to these factors are the uncertainties resulting from:



The US November elections



The UK’s June Brexit vote



The Bank of Japan’s stance on negative interest rates


So 2016’s turbulent seas are not stilled yet.  Ebbing and flowing global fears will expose opportunities at the local level. Our “Buy Value  (when it appears), Tuck Away, and Do not Chase the Markets” strategy remains in play.

 2H2016 Investment Outlook

1As at the time of writing in early June

MEET OUR PEOPLE






“My career at Eastspring started with a six month secondment to Singapore from Mumbai. I had never been anywhere outside of India at that time and within three months I realised that the opportunity to travel would be an integral part of my life going forwards.
15 years ago, as a trained accountant, I first joined Eastspring working in operations and IT, and since had the chance to move into finance and business analyst roles. Given my experience in different roles across the business, I was put forwards to lead the opening of a new office in Indonesia: COO, CFO and CTO – all my roles were being consolidated. Eastspring’s extensive global network offers new experiences and variety and allows me to continuously develop and hone my skills and expertise – I can’t imagine being anywhere else.”

Prem Subramanian 
“My career at Eastspring started with a six month secondment to Singapore from Mumbai. I had never been anywhere outside of India at that time and within three months I realised that the opportunity to travel would be an integral part of my life going forwards.
15 years ago, as a trained accountant, I first joined Eastspring working in operations and IT, and since had the chance to move into finance and business analyst roles. Given my experience in different roles across the business, I was put forwards to lead the opening of a new office in Indonesia: COO, CFO and CTO – all my roles were being consolidated. Eastspring’s extensive global network offers new experiences and variety and allows me to continuously develop and hone my skills and expertise – I can’t imagine being anywhere else.”









“Eastspring is truly a global company, enabling us to provide both local and global solutions for our clients. I’ve had the opportunity to travel to Korea, China, Hong Kong, London, Chicago, and every country offers a different perspective that informs our overall offering.
There is a borderless approach to sharing thought leadership and insights from all the countries we work in, and this helps us develop relevant and unique products.

At Eastspring everyone works with conviction. We don’t do something just because we can, we do it because we believe in it.”

“Eastspring offers employees the opportunity to move seamlessly within the organisation. I first joined over five years ago as a Marketing Manager, and have since had a number of roles within the business, including heading up new teams and consolidating others.
My managers have always supported me, and hard work is always recognised: if you perform well, it’s acknowledged and there’s the chance to take on new challenges. My career has progressed exponentially during my time with Eastspring, and it’s been a great journey.

It’s a warm and welcoming environment, with a culture that’s social and engaging. There’s plenty of healthy competition and inter-office activities, and it’s these little things, the small details, that make you feel part of a team.”

“I joined the organisation 14 years ago, at which time the Malaysian office consisted of a small team and we all had to pitch in. It felt really entrepreneurial. Today, we’ve grown considerably, but that original buzz and energy remains. 
This industry is always evolving; there are always new regulations and changes – it ups the ante, keeping things interesting, and Eastspring offers me the opportunity to be creative in this environment. 
I’ve had the opportunity to travel considerably. Learning trips to India and Korea for example have been a great way to see first-hand how our local teams are innovating for their markets, and how they structure their products. We have a culture of knowledge sharing across the company, and by leveraging our expertise in local markets we can create relevant and unique solutions for our clients in Malaysia."

“I joined Eastspring because I was looking to work for an Asian fund management company with a strong global footprint. In the four years that I’ve been with the organisation, my role has expanded from Southeast Asian institutional sales to covering a number of new markets.
Eastspring believes in team-work. We are consultative and approach all decision making collectively, as a team. Even among our fund managers, we don’t have one ‘star manager’ – we have a team of stars. Our leaders support us, watch out for our blind spots and of course, challenge us. My manager has always been a great sparring partner – any issue I bring to her will be challenged, debated and thought through – which always means a better result. Our team-based culture means the whole organisation shares the same objectives and goals.”

"I joined Prudential Asset Management (as we were known then) 15 years ago. I was attracted to the business due to the strong linkage to the Prudential Insurance business, which seemed to have enormous growth potential.
I liked the entrepreneurial spirit and drive of the organisation, which I felt stemmed from the fact that the business was managed and coordinated in Asia, as opposed to reporting lines into London or New York, as is common with other companies in Asia.
From my perspective, this creates a culture of local ownership, responsibility and accountability which drives better business outcomes for our clients.
The business has continually managed to attract impressive, smart and motivated people which I attribute to our strong corporate culture. With our success there have been many challenges over the years. Engaging with colleagues and clients to resolve issues and find solutions, which work for all stakeholders has been immensely rewarding and often stretches me to the limit in many ways. Asia is such a dynamic environment that today’s solution will probably not apply tomorrow, so you constantly have to refresh your knowledge and thinking and then try to adapt this to solve the latest challenge."

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Investment involves risk. The offering document should be read for further details including the risk factors. Past performance information presented is not indicative of future performance.
This website contains information about investment funds which invest in equities and/or bonds, each with different risk profiles. The funds may not be suitable for all investors. Prices of equities and bonds may fluctuate and you may not get back your original investment.
Some funds may invest in emerging markets, single countries or industry sectors. The investment focus of such funds might give rise to increased risk over more diversified funds.
Some funds may have significant exposure to financial derivatives instruments, which involve risks different from and possibly greater than, the risks presented by traditional investments. Risks associated with derivatives are market risk, management risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and leverage risk. The funds will also be exposed to credit risk of the counterparties with which it trades. In adverse market situations, the fund’s use of derivatives may become ineffective and the fund may suffer significant losses.
Some of the funds may be exposed to asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities. Risks associated with these securities include liquidity, market, credit risk and interest rates risks.
The value of the funds can be volatile and could go down substantially within a short period of time.
The investment decision is yours but you should not invest unless the intermediary who sells the fund to you has advised you that the fund is suitable for you and has explained why, including how the fund would be consistent with your investment objectives, risk profile and unique situation.
You should not make any investment decision solely based on the information on this website.


Please note that if you do not agree to the above information and the Disclaimer, Copyright and Other Important Notice and  Privacy Policy, you must leave this website immediately and stop all further access to its contents.
