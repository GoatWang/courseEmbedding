About Us - Patriot Financial Partners, L. P.







































About Us







Founded in 2007, Patriot Financial Partners is a private equity firm focused on investing in community banks, thrifts and financial services related companies throughout the United States.
Patriot’s objective is to seek superior risk-adjusted returns by applying a hands-on, value-added investment model to non-control investments within the community banking sector, which consists of more than 1,000 public and privately-held depository institutions that have between $500 million and $5 billion of assets. Patriot has expanded its focus to include adjacent niche markets within the financial services sector.
Portfolio companies should have strong management teams with successful track records. Patriot is looking for banks with demonstrated growth in assets, loans and core deposits; a strong credit culture; growth in net income; and acceptable levels of capital. Typically, as banks grow, their financial performance improves due to economies of scale. Therefore, the funds are focused on providing growth capital to companies, allowing them to grow and help achieve top quartile peer level financial performance, thereby enhancing shareholder value.
The team’s extensive industry knowledge, business contacts and operating backgrounds in the bank and thrift and capital markets industries provide value-added knowledge to portfolio company executives and boards of directors. In addition, Patriot has formed industry advisory boards for its funds to provide additional expertise to portfolio company management to help prioritize key business initiatives and implement best practices to help maximize individual company franchise growth.
