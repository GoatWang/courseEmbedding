EnviroStar And The Lollapalooza Effect - EnviroStar, Inc. (NYSEMKT:EVI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»EnviroStar And The Lollapalooza EffectNov. 3.15 | About: EnviroStar, Inc. (EVI) Jie Min Toh Long only, Deep Value, contrarian, micro-capSummaryEVI is going to change drastically as new CEO Henry Nahmad begins his roll-up of the dry cleaning equipment distributing industry.
        The current state of the dry cleaning equipment distributing industry and Nahmad’s background support his roll-up.
        EVI stands a good chance to increase market share in a USD$9 billion industry.
        Jettison the 10-Qs, the 10-Ks; forget everything you know about EnviroStar (NYSEMKT:EVI). The future will be nothing like the past. A new CEO-cum-owner is in town, and he brings a radically new strategy to the sleepy company. Untested and inexperienced, there's no certainty this strategy of his will succeed, but several factors are certainly in his favor. This article will evaluate the factors that determine his success.
Understanding the acquisition of EnviroStar
On March 9th 2015, an unknown investment firm, Symmetric Capital LLC, purchased a 40.4% stake in EnviroStar. The investment firm's sole controller was a young 36 year old by the name of Henry Nahmad. Who was he and why would he takeover and manage a microcap dry cleaning company?
A little family history on the Nahmad's is due. In 1972, Albert Nahmad acquired a sleepy holdings company by the name of Watsco (NYSE:WSO) for under US$2 million. In the late 1980s, Albert began focusing on acquisitions in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC/R) industry. Back then, the HVAC/R industry was highly fragmented, and in Albert's own words: "There's no one out there consolidating in the industry except us". Slowly but steadily, Albert executed a buy-and-build strategy, acquiring 80% of Gemaire Distributors for US$17.1 million in 1989, 50.5% of Heating & Cooling Supply Inc. in 1990 for US$16 million and many more. The success of Albert Nahmad is clear. Watsco has a current market cap of US$4.5 billion and is the industry leader.
Albert Nahmad is also the uncle of Henry Nahmad, our current CEO of EnviroStar. Henry's cousin (i.e Albert's son) sits on the board of Watsco along with his father.

The pieces of the puzzle start to fall in place, with a little speculation to fill the pieces. Stuart Wagner, a former member of both EnviroStar and Watsco's boards may have connected Henry to the Steiners, the former owners of EnviroStar, as Henry tries to follow in the footsteps of his uncle. What we do know for sure is that in a similarly highly-fragmented cleaning equipment distribution industry, Henry Nahmad intends to acquire and build an industry leader just as his uncle did with HVAC/R and Watsco. In the history section of their webpage, EnviroStar proudly states that "Together, Henry M. Nahmad and Michael S. Steiner, Executive Vice President of the Company, are spearheading EnviroStar's efforts to build a market leader through the execution of its buy-and-build strategy."
A quick introduction of the buy-and-build (i.e the roll-up)
What is a roll-up? What does it offer to EnviroStar if it succeeds?
A roll-up involves the consolidation of a large number of small companies in the same industry to create a market leader. Such industries tend to be highly fragmented. The reason for such consolidation includes costs savings from reaping economies of scales and increasing revenue from an increase in market power. Apart from Watsco, some other examples include SYSCO Corporation (NYSE: SYY) in the food distribution industry and Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX) in the clinical laboratory industry.
Understanding the current state of EnviroStar
EnviroStar operates two fully owned subsidiaries in slightly different market segments. These two business units comprise the entirety of its sales. First, there's Steiner-Atlantic, a laundry/dry cleaning/boiler equipment distribution business. Next, we have DryClean USA, which franchises and licenses dry cleaning stores. Though DryClean USA is arguably the more recognized of the two given its 400 stores internationally, its revenue and profits are insignificant compared to Steiner-Atlantic's.


From EnviroStar's latest 10-K, DryClean USA's franchising fees account for a paltry 5.7% of total revenues and 1.8% of profits in 2015 (the spike in 2014 was from a one-off sale of a master franchise in Mexico).
It must hence be clarified that the market segment EnviroStar intends to begin its roll-up in is in equipment distribution, in the B2B space, rather than the B2C of dry cleaning stores. This is the same space that Watsco succeeded in its acquisition strategy with HVAC/R. EnviroStar's competitors are not your familiar names like Comet Cleaners or Lapels Dry Cleaning.
Factors that govern success of roll-up
EnviroStar has yet to acquire any distributor since Nahmad's takeover. Despite the lack of data points in this regard, there are factors that we can use to evaluate the success of EnviroStar's strategy.
Nahmad's Background
First and most salient, Henry Nahmad's background certainly contributes to EnviroStar's eventual success. Nahmad, not just his family, has had his fair share of experience with the buy-and-build strategy. Prior to his acquisition of EnviroStar, he was Watsco's Director of Corporate Development and "executed and integrated multiple acquisitions of HVAC/R distributors ranging in size from $10mm to $100mm in enterprise value". Nahmad has had fair experience with management as well. Before EnviroStar, he was CEO of Chemstar Corporation, a company that specialized in food compliance. With Nahmad's 40.4% stake in EnviroStar, his incentives are clearly aligned with the company doing well. Nahmad may well prove to be a competent and committed CEO.
Of course, it would be foolish to depict Nahmad as some sort of miracle worker. It is undeniable he has zero experience with the dry cleaning industry. This will inhibit successful integration of acquired companies.
However, his inexperience in the industry is mitigated in part by the rest of management and the board. Michael Steiner, the current COO, was the founder of Steiner-Atlantic and is a veteran in the industry. He still retains an 8.5% stake in EnviroStar after the sale. Similarly experienced is current CFO Venerando Indelicato, who has served in this position since 1998.

In the latest DEF-14A, it is stated that "Mr. Michael Steiner and Mr. Robert Steiner are … to vote all shares of the Company's Common Stock owned by them at any time during the term of the Stockholders Agreement as directed by Mr. Nahmad". In other words, Nahmad's 40.4% stake in the company effectively translates to 50.3% voting power. Despite talk of partnership with the Steiners, let there be no doubt that it is Nahmad who holds the final say in the company. I think this is key for Nahmad to bring about a thorough strategic change in the company.
The state of the industry
From EnviroStar's latest 10-K, "The commercial and industrial laundry, drycleaning equipment and boiler distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented, with over 100 full-line or partial-line equipment distributors in the United States. The Company's management believes that no one distributor has a major share of the market; substantially all distributors are independently owned; and, with the exception of several regional distributors, distributors operate primarily in local markets." As mentioned above, such a highly fragmented industry is where a roll-up typically occurs.
In order to analyze whether a consolidation play in this industry will be profitable, I will employ the 5C's framework as detailed in the paper "The 5-Cs: A Modern Framework for Consolidation of Fragmented Industries". A set of five criteria are used in this process, all of which seem to suggest the industry is suitable for consolidation. They are:

Capital access restricted;
Cultures and regions compatible;
Customers and competitors receptive;
Change catalysts unlikely;
Competitive advantage realizable for the consolidator.

1. Ceteris Paribus, a bigger company can receive cheaper capital than a smaller one simply because it is deemed more credit-worthy with its larger amount of assets. However, the significance of cost of capital varies from industry to industry. I would argue that it is extremely significant in the dry cleaning equipment distribution industry given how expensive the equipment is. With prices ranging up to the hundreds of thousands per equipment, a significant amount of capital is certainly needed for purchasing from manufacturers. Lower cost of capital in turn leads to higher profit margins.

2. Are distributors willing to sell their shares and lose some of their autonomy? There is too little information available to conclusively answer this question. However, management of the existing regional distributors is generally pretty old, and may be looking for an opportunity to cash out, just as the Steiners did with EnviroStar.
3. Due to the infrequent need for purchasing dry cleaning equipment, customers have less of an inclination to frequent the same distributor. Because of the lack of interaction between customer and distributor, the transaction becomes impersonal and highly based on costs. As such, it is unlikely the customer will have any negative perception of a consolidation so as long as their costs remain the same.
4. There are unlikely to be any change catalysts affecting the industry. The B2C industry is getting disrupted by a slew of tech startups but the need for dry cleaning equipment remains. The amount of clothes that need to be dry cleaned is unlikely to diminish as well. Manufacturers tend to use 'dry clean only' labels as a cover all to protect themselves.
5. There exist economies of scale upon consolidation. Distributors can have a central distribution point, purchase specialist capital equipment and so forth. The actual reaping of economies of scale will come from the integration of acquired companies, so not much can be said here yet.
Understanding the risks of the investment
The state of the economy
A recession may well bring EnviroStar down as with most acquisitive strategies. The cost of capital will increase. If stock is used to fund acquisitions, the company needs to keep stock price up which is difficult in a market decline. Alternatively, if acquisitions are funded by debt, a decline in cash flow may lead to inability in meeting payments. This is exacerbated by the nature of dry cleaning equipment. Being big-ticket items, in times of recession, customers may hold back on replacing their existing equipment, leading to sharp drop in profits. A recession would likely lead to me exiting my position.

Nahmad fails in executing the buy-and-build
If Nahmad fails to properly execute the buy-and-build, for instance, overpaying for acquisitions or is unable to reap economies of scale from integrating the company, EnviroStar will fail. There are many roll-ups that have suffered this fate, though none from this particular industry and some of these have even gone bust. I will be closely monitoring the stock and exiting if there are any signs of this.
Nahmad doesn't execute the buy-and-build
No known timeline has been given yet regarding its execution. For all we know, the actual execution may only be years in the future. EnviroStar is not a short-term play. The market is already factoring in high growth, with the stock having a P/E of 15 even though earnings have been stagnant for the last 3 years. The stock price wil fall if this occurs. Having said this, the fundamental business of EnviroStar is extremely solid and the profits have been stable. The company is in a very healthy financial position, with over USD$3.9 million in cash and zero debt. EnviroStar has a relatively low down side given this.
Concluding
Put a sleepy forgotten product, an ambitious, young CEO and an industry with much to gain for consolidation together and you might just have the ingredients necessary for explosive growth. This has led me to open a small position in EnviroStar. The dry cleaning market is worth USD$9 billion and EnviroStar is poised to capture an increasing amount of it. I will be closely monitoring EnviroStar and provide a more detailed valuation as the roll-up begins.
