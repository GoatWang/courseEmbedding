IMC's New Web Warehouse  / Redefining Online Parts Ordering 

The IMC Web Warehouse has undergone a transformation from being just a tool to now redefining online parts ordering.  Here is a list of a few of the new features.
What's New?
Customize Your Experience – Tailor the interface to your business by selecting the information and options that you want to see and use, to make the IMC Web Warehouse work best for you.
Latest Vehicle Inquiries – Any of your last 15 vehicles inquires is just a click away.
Pre-Sorted Product Categories – While looking up parts for a specific vehicle, the IMC Web Warehouse presorts parts by category so the categories you need are always on screen for easy access.
Online Returns – This time saving feature allows you to process your returns through the IMC Web Warehouse.
My Jobs – The electronic version of our popular 'Want Pad' tool allows you create a parts list electronically, and then you can  order the parts from the list with the click of a mouse. 
 Fast Order – Know the part numbers you want (IMC's or other industry numbers interchange)?  Type them in and the order is done.

Why Choose IMC for your filter needs?
There are many reasons to choose Integrated Microwave Corporation (IMC) as your filter supplier.  Call IMC to get direct access to a filter design engineer who can answer your questions immediately.  Our "sales" people are our engineers.  Simulations and quotations are emailed to you, sometimes before your telephone discussion is over.  AutoCad or SolidWorks drawings are available to you for use in your Source Control Drawing at no cost, so why re-CAD? Quotations are complete and easy to read, with drawings and performance plots attached.  Specifications are guaranteed, not "typical" and IMC products are 100% tested, not sampled.  IMC means business and we won't waste your time.

IMC manufactures its own ceramic resonators and microwave capacitors for in-house use, and for sale as components.   Every week, IMC fires and metalizes ceramic resonators using our own recipes, in our own facility located in San Diego, California.  We control and characterize every aspect of production, and stock millions of components. IMC's customers benefit from lower pricing, faster leadtimes, better filter optimization and total design control. IMC is truly the market leader in custom ceramic filters and diplexers. IMC also manufactures lumped-element filters (DC-20 GHz) and a complete line of cavity filter products (350 MHz - 20 GHz).  Almost 100% of IMC's business is custom filters, so tell us what you want!
