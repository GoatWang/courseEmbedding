RUSTALL REVIEWby Thomas Knapp


by Thomas Knapp, MMR #101

rust (rŭst) Any of various powdery
or scaly reddish-brown or reddish-yellow hydrated ferric oxides formed on iron
and iron-containing materials by low-temperature oxidation in the presence of
water.


Any of various metallic coatings, especially oxides,
formed by corrosion.
A stain or coating resembling iron rust.


E
xcept for
brand new (like in…today…) or freshly back-shopped equipment, virtually
all railway equipment has some rust, dirt and other deposits on it resulting
from use and exposure to the elements. Railroad equipment manufacturers, owners
and operators all try to prevent this, with varying levels of effort and with
varying degrees of success.odel
railroaders call it “weathering” and love it!




When weathering equipment, it is important to understand the cause of the
weathering, and the direction from whence it comes. Soot on locomotive skylines
and roofs emanates from stacks, settles down on top of horizontal surfaces, and
its area of accumulation extends back along the equipment by virtue of the

equipment’s generally forward motion. Calcium and other contaminants borne by
feed water or steam generally flow down from the source as the steam condenses
on the outer surface of the metal jacket of domes, cylinders and pumps. Metal
surfaces that experience high heat cycles which burn off paint or other surface
protection, such as smokeboxes, fireboxes and firebox stay bolts will have
surface rust. Water may tend to accumulate at seams and joints in horizontal
metal surfaces, such as around water hatches on tenders or on side tanks, with
resulting rust. Riveted joints in water tanks will often show rust deposits
around the head of the rivet either from the accumulation of external water, or
from seeping at the rivet. Lubricating oils and grease – although not
“weathering” - will leave deposits – sometimes shiny – on metal surfaces. Dirt
thrown up by the movement of equipment through the environment will accumulate
on running gear and sometimes the lower sides of equipment. Freight equipment
is not only subject to many of these same weathering impacts, but also the
materials they are subject to handling, or processes associated with those
materials, from the lye used to sanitize stock cars, to coal dust, to … well…
you get the idea. Another condition which is lumped into “weathering” is the
fading and oxidation of painted surfaces due to sunlight and exposure to the
air. (See sidebar.)

Speaking of
oxidation, back to the main subject of this article – RUST. To paraphrase a definition
from Wikipedia:

“Rust is a general term for a series of iron
oxides. Colloquially, the term is applied to red oxides, formed by the reaction
of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. ... Rust consists
of hydrated iron oxides Fe2O3·nH2O and iron
oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)3). ... Given sufficient time,
oxygen, and water, any iron mass eventually converts entirely to rust and
disintegrates.”

Now, we usually don’t want our model railway equipment to disintegrate, but, we do want to try
and realistically capture the look of rust – whether it is minor and incidental
rust on an otherwise well-maintained piece of equipment, or that terminal rust
that is the precursor to the eventual disintegration of wrecked and abandoned
metal junk. Modelers creatively portray rust using several methods. Not all
methods “scale down” successfully to N-scale. Techniques such as dry-brushing
with rust-colored paints, besides being one of the less “controllable”
techniques, tends to hit the high portions of model surfaces, such as the tops
of rivets, etc. Chalks have the same problem, although they are more controlled
and can be worked down to settle into recesses. However, the best method I have
found to duplicate rust, from minor to major, is a liquid product called
RUSTALL. ( www.rustall.com ) This product

comes in a four-part kit, and can be applied to anything – metal, styrene,
wood, paper, your fingers (although the later is not recommended by the author)
– and will produce a realistic and finely grained or coarse and crumbly rust
texture. (A major model supply company has recently come out with a “copy-cat”
product, which I have tried and discarded – in my opinion the color and consistency
of the “rust” is not as good as the original.) The key component of the four
parts is a “rust” solution which is thin and fluid, and is applied in layers,
building up the rust to the level desired. It flows readily across a model
surface and collects around the edges of rivets, in seams, and at abrupt
changes in panels – in the same way water would collect on metal and gradually
oxidize the metal into rust. The kit also includes a black solution which can
be applied to surfaces to collect in recesses in much the same way and bring
out detail. The third part of the kit is a “dead flat” sealer coat, and the
fourth part is an optional very finely ground dirt with some clay in it which
can be dusted onto surfaces to... well ... represent “dirt.” It also can be
used in combination with the other parts to create very coarse, crumbly rust
effects in larger scales, although with care you can also use it this way in N,
as will be seen in a couple of examples in this article. If you use one of the
components up, replacements bottle of each of the individual components are
available.




The instructions (both printed and on-line) described the simple four-step process:
slosh on the rust solution (#1); when dry, apply a coat of the back solution
(#2); seal with a coat of “dead flat” (#3); dust with dirt (#4). It is pretty
fool-proof. The unique property of these components which sets them apart from

other ways of simulating rust is the controllability of results. Solutions #1
and #2 deposit small, thin layers of their rusting and blackening ingredients,
allowing the modeler to control the degree and location of rusting. Also, if
you don’t like the result, you can easily remove it with alcohol. For this
article, I have prepared examples representing degrees from very minor rust
deposits which might be found on well maintained equipment, to significant rust
on still-in-service equipment, to crumbly, flaking rust on scrap or abandoned
equipment. The step-by-step photo examples are supplemented by vignettes of
completed models illustrating the modeling of different rust effects.



I selected a variety of metal castings of industrial equipment as an example of how to “rust”
old equipment. (Photo 1) I mounted these castings on a plastic card using

double-stick tape, then gave all a base coat of Floquil Weathered Black (see
sidebar.) Before the undercoat dried, the single-cylinder horizontal steam
engine and one of the modern boiler fronts were given a sprinkling of the dirt
in #4, while the sides of the air compressor tank received a very fine dusting
of #4. When the undercoat had dried, the castings were then given multiple
coats of solution #1. (Photo 2) When I was satisfied with the amount of “rust”
on the parts, I applied the blackening solution #2. The results of the “rusting”
are show in the group portrait (Photo 3.) The different effects are clearly
seen in the comparison of the lathe (Photo 4) or the Erie steam hammer (Photo 5),
which have surface rust to the flaking scale on the air compressor tank (Photo 6).
This is also clear in the two different
effects represented on the modern gas boiler fronts (Photo 7) one of which
represents a recently rusted, perhaps still functioning boiler, the other which
is clearly beyond redemption. The rust deposits and blackener can also work on
painted parts such as the three red oil drums. (Photo 8) For the 18” gauge ore
car in Photo 9, I applied an additional thinned coat of Weathered Black to the
inside of the car after rusting, and sprinkled more #4 inside.




Most of my railway equipment is weathered to represent well used, aging – sometimes second
hand as in the case of a lot of Pacific Coast Railway equipment – but still

roadworthy equipment. Photo 10 shows typical rust deposits on the top of a
tender where excess water from filling the tender has accumulated and caused
minor surface rust. The side tank on the 0-6-0T in Photo 11 has minor rust
around the heads of the tank rivets, and on the top of the tank at the filler.  Both of these represent a single application
of RUSTALL solution #1. Contrast this with the saddle tank 0-6-0T in Photo 12,
which represents a roughly treated locomotive. Two areas where even
well-maintained steam locomotives with any service time will show rust are the
smokebox and firebox. The smokebox in Photo 13 is an example of surface rust on
the smokebox of an in-service well weathered (but not derelict) road engine.
Likewise, Photo 14 shows the firebox of an in-service K-28.


As a non-steam example, the narrow gauge center cab diesel in the Photo 15 was weathered to
represent an industrial or contractor-owned switcher which is showing its age,
but is still a serviceable workhorse. In this case, the rust deposits represent
surface rust on painted sheet metal. Light applications were allowed to gather
at the edges of surfaces and in recesses such as louvers and the edges of
access doors. 

Modern railway equipment is perhaps even more subject to a lack of cosmetic maintenance than
period equipment (or perhaps it is modern color schemes show more than vintage
schemes?) Whether it is because equipment strays so far from home in modern
interchange, or the simple realities of life-cycle-cost-analysis on maintenance
programs, a lot of modern freight rolling stock looks “old before its years.”
Not having any modern standard gauge equipment, I bought a Red Caboose FMC
covered hopper lettered for Cook Industries for this how-to example, although

not an ideal candidate, as it is not painted, but raw plastic molded in the
finish colors. Photos 16 and 17 show the car and trucks before applying the
RUSTALL weathering regime. The first step is to slosh on some of solution #1
(Photo 18) on one side at a time to control the direction the solution flows.
Move on to another face only after the one you just did dries. Since this is intended
to represent a car in active interchange service, one application on each face
was all that was necessary. (Compare Photo 17 to Photo 19.) The undersides of
railway cars accumulate dirt, mud, oils and grease thrown up from the track and
thrown off by lubricated components such as trucks. They quickly lose any
semblance of the upper surfaces colors. I gave the bottom of the hopper a coat
of Floquil “Foundation” to tone down the “baby blue” of the molded plastic, and
to provide a base for the weathering. To this I applied a coat of rust solution
#1. (Photo 20) After the “rust” was dry, I applied a coat of “dead flat” #3.
(Photo 21) When this first coat was dry, I applied a second, and – while still
wet – sprinkled the wet surfaces with dirt from bottle #4 using a brush to
transfer the material and spread it around. (Photo 22) The result was a floor
crusted with dust and dirt, with rust showing through here and there. (Photo 23)
I gave the trucks a coat of Master Modeler Burnt Umber (Photo 24), then followed
with rust solution #1 (Photo 25) and black solution #3, which settled in
recesses and brought out the details (Photo 26). The top of the car received
washes of solutions #1 and #2 as well. (Photo 27) Compare the completed car
(Photo 28) with the out-of-the-box car (Photo 16) and the detail of the end
(Photo 29) with the as-bought end (Photo 17). I think the completed model looks
quite realistic in a layout setting. (Photo 30) Rust is not confined to the
cars themselves – sometimes the contents have rusted, as in the scrap metal
load in Photo.

I have also
used RUSTALL on road vehicles and structures. The pickup on the left in Photo 32
is badly rusted, with flaky chunks of rust on the surface, while the flatbed in
the back has only trace amounts of rust. The fuel oil tank in Photo 33 shows
rust at the riveted seams in the metal tank. 
And the cast resin scrap pile in Photo 34 was prepared the same way as
the industrial equipment castings at the start of this article. Finally, ending
this diatribe on rust, Photo 35 combines rusted corrugated iron siding, a rusty
mining ore car, and a venerable 0-6-0T, all weathered with RUSTALL.

SIDEBAR
“Aging”
versus “Weathering”
While Ithink the semantics could be debated, the real distinction here is a “real
world” difference between the degradation of a surface such as happens with
rust, blistering and peeling paint, oxidation of painted surfaces, splintering
and graining of wood, etc. and the obscuring of a surface due to build up of
other materials such as mud, dirt, grease, etc. on the surface of the base
material. As modelers, we may use techniques of applying something to the top
of a surface to simulate the degradation of the base surface, but need to be
aware of this real world distinction. Even relatively clean surfaces will
degrade with age and exposure to pollutants in the air and to the fading
effects of sunlight.

Before applying surface weathering the base surface should be prepared to represent
the “baseline” material condition. Steam locomotives were commonly painted
black. Observation of builders’ photos of new equipment will show crisp, shiny

black coats of paint. They will also show these shiny, black painted locos
actually will reflect sky colors, tending to mute the black to shades of gray,
especially on upper surfaces. Besides being unrealistic, in a typical train
room or train show setting, details on locomotives painted “Engine Black” tend
to get lost. There are two schools of thought on “black” locomotives. One
starts with Floquil Engine Black, then follows with an airbrush coat of Floquil
Weathered Black, then very light dry-brush application of light gray to
high-light top, reflective, surfaces. This has been the typical way of modeling
an oxidized black paint finish in most scales for decades. Many N scale
modelers follow this proven method. However, on kit and scratch-built
locomotives which I know I will want to represent as weathered, I usually start
by airbrushing the entire locomotive Floquil Weathered Black and skip the
“undercoat” of Engine Black, then move on to dry brush for “high lights” and
then the application of weathering. For miscellaneous ironmongery you are
weathering and rusting, give it a base coat of Floquil Weathered Black of
Humbrol No. 76 before commencing the “rusting” process. . For factory painted
equipment, with light “aging” effects, you may need to do nothing. For
equipment that has several years’ exposure to the elements, one of the most
visible effects will be on lettering and on dark painted surfaces. There are a variety
of ways of “toning down” colors and lettering/graphics. One is carefully
dry-brushing or light air brushing with the background color. Another is to
abrade the surface with something such as a fiberglass scratch brush. (All the
locomotive lettering in the accompanying photos was “aged” using dry brushing
of the background color over the lettering and numbers.)

After being misdiagnosed by three other doctors, I finally found out what the problem was when I saw Dr. Knapp. With a cortisone shot he did exactly in the right place with very little pain. He is the reason I am basically pain free. 
As with his assistant, Brandi, I had nothing bad to say. She called me right back and was very helpful with appointments.
I have nothing bad to say about Knapp, he is an incredible doctor who really does care about the person.







DO NOT GO TO KNAPP!!! I am a pro fighter and a contractor. Knapp said my arthritis is so bad that I needed a reverse shoulder replacement. He said the arthritis is so bad theres no point in trying to fix the rotator cuff,tendens and ligaments!! I Left his office a complete mess. I ended up getting four YES 4 second oppinions and not one has even mentioned arthritis!! I told each Dr what Knapp said (after they diagnose me) and each one said"I have NO idea why he said that?? i can fix your shoulder YOU DON'T NEED A REPLACEMENT!! " Knapp is NOT a good DR. I actually think he's making money from the replacement manufactures! I am happy to say I am scheduled for surgery a GOOD Dr and will be back to the gym in nine months







Dr. Knapp is a fantastic Dr. and a world class surgeon.  I went in to get my Right Shoulder repaired after an acute injury playing a contact sport.  4 years later after heavy weight training and usage of my right shoulder it remains strong and healthy  I've had my left shoulder completely reconstructed as of about 2 years ago with Dr. Knapp as well.  It too has recovered really well.  He's a pro.







Do not have your surgery done by Dr. Knapp.  3 years after my shoulder surgery I am still in pain every day.  He did a really bad job.  He is also very arrogant.  Huge regrets I didn't go to Kerlan Jobe like I had with my previous shoulder surgery.  That one is stronger and better than ever.  What a mistake.  He also over-charged me and I literally just now - 3 YEARS LATER - got a reimbursement check.  So I felt compelled to write on Yelp.  I could almost forgive the other stuff if I didn't still have constant shoulder pain and felt that he repaired my shoulder properly.  I can't believe this guy has such a great reputation.







Happy First Day of Breast Cancer Awareness month to Me!  Dr. Knapp is seemingly ill-equipped and unprofessional in the administration of care.  In late 2014 I was diagnosed with severe frozen shoulder and referred to Dr. Knapp by my primary care physician.  The first visit was great.  In front of several associates Dr. Knapp told me how he was going to do for me what he did for his wife and several other family members who had suffered with frozen shoulder due to breast cancer.  He gave me a cortisone shot, referred me to a different physical therapist from my previous and sent me on my way.  I guess he forgot what he told me in the examination room the first time because he's done anything but.  This office refuses to adequately and expediently submit paperwork for employment and/or insurance verification.  He's offered me no other alternatives to aid the healing of shoulder such as surgical manipulations or anything for which he's supposed to be the Nation's foremost authority.  And communication with him outside of the examination room is ONLY via third party. You don't speak with Dr. Knapp EVER!  When you get an appointment, prepare to wait and if you need paperwork, prepare to fight.  I read one review that gave him an excellent review for my same issue.  I wish I could share in that sentiment but I can't.







I have not yet had surgery wth Dr. Knapp, but I did want to comment on the professionalism of all of his staff members.  They promptly scheduled my appointment and advised me of what I needed to bring with me to the appointment. When I arrived, I was first seen by his Fellow who did a detailed explanation with me of my MRI.  Dr. Knapp ordered another MRI, but this time with contrast, and much to my surprise, he actually called me on Saturday morning, the day he received my MRI results, because, he said, "I know patients are anxious to hear their results."  He answered all my questions on the phone and explained to me what my srugery would entail.  Since then his staff have promptly followed up with me.  If my surgery goes as smoothly as my pre op experience, I will be a happy camper.







Astonishingly badly run office. Extremely difficult to get anyone on the phone. Your appointment with "Dr. Knapp" is mostly run by another Dr, with Knapp coming in for a couple minutes at the end. 

A few months ago I had to wait four weeks for Knapp to get back to me re: my MRI. When he did, it was some girl named Brandi who was going to send me for more tests, without telling me what Knapp had seen in the MRI or what my diagnosis was. 

Knapp is supposed to be a great shoulder guy but his office is one of the worst run I've ever experienced.







To be clear, I never actually saw Dr. Knapp. I was too turned off by the poor bedside manner of his staff. They were unsympathetic and completely not helpful. 

One of the nurses, Brandi, scheduled me for the wrong appointment and then argued with me over it. She had so much attitude that I hobbled out of the office on my crutches- I couldn't bear to stay for the consult.

It's hard enough to be injured and to deal with countless doctors, exams and appointments. I don't need obstinance from hospital staff.







I have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Knapp. If you want a doctor who knows and understands shoulders, he's your guy.  I had been suffering from shoulder pain for close to a year and was very close to surgery with my regular orthopedist who I've trusted for years. I was urged by a friend to get a second opinion and was referred to Dr. Knapp. Prior to this appointment, I'd had 2 cortisone shots, physical therapy, chiropractic care, massage therapy, two MRI's and was still in pain.  It turns out that the radiologist who read the films on my first MRI made a mistake and missed the problem and my first doc missed it too.  When I arrived at Dr. Knapp's office, I did not experience any of the problems mentioned in other Yelp reviews. The first doc to see me was a Fellow, who did a preliminary exam prior to Dr. Knapp entering the room. This is a very standard procedure that I've experienced in many other Dr. offices. It was actually the first doc who identified the issue on the films and Dr. Knapp confirmed it (it was a rare genetic abnormality). Once they figured it out, I was given a cortisone shot (finally in the RIGHT place) and after it kicked in, I was 100% cured. I write this after more than 3 months (just to make sure the shot wasn't going to wear off and the pain was going to come back). I am eternally grateful that I saw Dr. Knapp and his staff vs. going under the knife with another doctor!







Incision site has not closed up!  Its been three months and my boyfriend still has a gapping hole in his armpit that is discharging yellow pus.  His surgery was done the second week in MARCH!  We have gone through roll after roll of gauze and bandages. At first Dr. Knapp dug around in the incision with a wooden stick and tried to pull out subcutaneous stitches.  When that didn't work he recommended another round of antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointment.  My boyfriend has gone back week after week to no avail.  Dr. Knapp still has not given my boyfriend a real reason as to why the incision site is not closing up.  When my boyfriend tried to get in to see Dr. Knapp this week they let him know that his three months are almost up.  I guess the doctor gives you up to three months of free appointments post surgery, but after that they will start to charge the patient again.  That makes no sense for someone whose surgery has been botched.  Dr. Knapp does not seem concerned about leaving my boyfriend with a open hole in his armpit.  I guess why should he he has already been paid for the surgery.  At this point Dr. Knapp is not making any more money on my boyfriend by fixing him.  In the mean time my boyfriend has been unable to workout, get in a pool, hot tub, steam room, or sweat in general because of the risk of infection.  The armpit runs one of the highest risks of infection. Again Dr. Knapp does not seem to be concerned or understand how inconvenient that is for an active person. When he tried to get an appointment this week his staff did not return his phone calls.  When you call the office you get an operator who is not even in the office.  When you ask to be transferred to a staff member you almost always get a voicemail.  When you leave a voicemail message for his staff nobody calls you back. When you do get ahold of someone they say they have to call you back but don't.  After leaving three voicemail messages we still have not heard from Dr. Knapp.  One would think a doctor would call his patients back. Read this WARNING before you decide to use this doctor. I wish we had read the reviews below as they seem to be saying the same thing.







OK I have read ALL of the reviews. I am not a woman so I cannot comment on the details related to putting a bra on post surgery... However, I can say that Dr. Knapp called me personally several times post surgery, including on the weekends and met with me on a Saturday with his son in tow because of the dicey recovery I had from a very intricate and difficult shoulder surgery.  The comments regarding his assistant (Brandi) are fair. I am not sure scheduling and patient discussions are her forte. I really didn't appreciate being told to take an Advil when clearly I was having a post surgery complication.

I am recovered and thankful for my choice of Dr. Knapp as a surgeon. For me it was a very good decision despite having choices closer to home.







After scheduling my appointment a month in advance, I gathered all of the materials I needed including my MRI report and a DVD of xrays and showed up on time. 
After a 20 minute wait I was told that the MRI films were needed IN ADDITION to the complete report that I provided which was normal. (Films for normal reports--really? Sounds like a load of crap to me.) And then as I was trying to get the films emailed over I was told I needed to reschedule and was given no opportunity to provide the "necessary" records then and there. Nevermind the fact that another patient showed up AN HOUR late and was given the opportunity to gather additional records as other patients were waiting. 

Call me crazy, but don't doctors order reports as needed? Why is it necessary to have seen another doctor prior to seeing Knapp. Huh. I was told when I booked the appointment that some of my tests may be too old, and that I would need to repeat them. Which makes me wonder why I was sent off packing before THE DOCTOR could make that assessment HIMSELF, not his administrative assistant who went to community college somewhere near a freeway, I'm sure.

I never had the chance to interact with Dr. Knapp, but given how I was treated I will never lay eyes on him. If he wants his office to be run by a total [insert expletive adjective, insert expletive noun], then he can be assured he'll lose out on plenty of business and that the list of negative reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere will grow. This office was completely unprofessional and I will make it my life's mission to ensure that no one I know ever visits anyone any doctor in this practice.







Surgery was not totally successful but perhaps it was the best anyone could have done. Don't know. I understand that he has a good reputation as a surgeon. 

What I do know is that I routinely waited over 45 minutes past my appointment time for every scheduled appointment before seeing Dr. Knapp. He also has the all time record at any Dr's office in anytime in my life for making me wait 1 hour and 45 minutes past my appointment time to see him. If it wasn't for a needed post surgical follow-up I would have left and seen another Dr. 

This office clearly clearly over books and in doing so sends patient's the message that their time is not important but the Dr.'s time and their ability to see as many people as possible is very important.







Dr. Knapp is possibly the best orthopedic surgeon the side of the country has to offer. Not only does he have incredible bedside manner [just ask him WHY he wanted to get into medicine...he has such a heart for helping others] but you won't be able to find another doctor who is as brilliant and compassionate as him. I do a ton of research before going to a doctor and found out that not only is he highly praised doctor, but has invented many tools in the medical field that have revolutionized surgery. These tools are now used WORLDWIDE to change the way that surgeons operate. I don't know about you but that to me says alot...a doctor who knows how to fix problems so well that he invents new ways to do it much more accurately. I went to another doctor who had to make 4 incisions on my shoulder but found out after the fact that Dr. Knapp could have done the same procedure with the same results with only 2 incisions. I won't be going to any one else ever again. And as for the wait time...I'd rather see a doctor who everyone is fighting to see because of his incredible skill then walk right into an appointment with someone who isn't as accurate. What's more important to you...wait time or your body getting the best care? I know what my answer is.







I really wish I would have read these reviews prior to scheduling an appointment with Dr. Knapp.  I found his office staff and procedures to be condescending, rude and narassistic.  They insisted that I have an MRI PRIOR to coming in for the appointment, that I bring withme the report and the disk.  They sent me pages of forms to complete.  When I arrived, the receptioinst, Ginger, scolded me for not having completed portions of my paper work in advance of the appointment.  When I explained that the answer to the question depended on the circumstances and that I wanted to speak with the doctor for clarification, she told me firmly, "No.  Dr. Knapp is very picky and wants all of the questions answered before he will see you".  She made several other snappy remarks before I was made to wait to see the Dr.'s medical assistant.  

Once I got in to see the medical assistant, she told me that I would need to have an x-ray BEFORE I saw the doctor.  Mind you, the doctor had already insisted that I receive an MRI test and bring with me the disk and report or "he would not see me".  So he had my MRI, why did he need an x-ray now too, that was not mentioned previously, and why should I have to be exposed to radiation, and have my insurance pay for another procdure, PRIOR to my even seeing the doctor?  When I asked to speak with Dr. Knapp the mecial assistnat told me "Sorry, he is very particular and will not talk to you without the x-ray."   Either his poor staff has been so badly mistreaten that they don't dare risk their job by accomodating a patient's reasonable requests, or this Dr. Knapp is a complete narassisist who thinks his time is more important than his patients.  Well, I'm sorry but in Santa Monica there are a lot of important people whose time and money is as (or more) important than Dr. Knapp's, mine included.  So I'll be finding a more professional doctor and staff and taking my business elsewhere.







Believe me, you are far from the only person who ever has had a problem dealing with Brandi.  It's too bad she's such a turnoff, because Knapp is a great orthopedist.







I love love love Dr. Knapp!!  He is an excellent doctor with great bedside manners. He has excellent follow through when it comes to his patients. In fact, I have used him twice (shoulder and knee surgery).  I went to three doctor's regarding my shoulder and they all stated I needed only physical therapy (which made my shoulder worse). One of the doctor's who couldn't figure out what was wrong with my shoulder referred me to Dr. Knapp. Dr. Knapp was the only doctor to suggest a MRI and he found what was wrong with my shoulder. As for Dr. Knapp's staff I have never had a bad experience with them (Brandi or Yoli). In fact, Brandi has only been kind to me and very helpful. Trust me when I say this that if I ever had a bad experience St John's would know and I would post it everywhere. I have had bad experiences with other doctor's at St. John's but not with Dr. Knapp. I'm sorry to hear that some patient's have had a bad experience with Dr Knapp and his staff. I truly have had top notch service and have recommended Dr. Knapp to several of my friends.

After being misdiagnosed by three other doctors, I finally found out what the problem was when I saw Dr. Knapp. With a cortisone shot he did exactly in the right place with very little pain. He is the reason I am basically pain free. As with his assistant, Brandi, I had nothing bad to say. She called me right back and was very helpful with appointments.I have nothing bad to say about Knapp, he is an incredible doctor who really does care about the person.

DO NOT GO TO KNAPP!!! I am a pro fighter and a contractor. Knapp said my arthritis is so bad that I needed a reverse shoulder replacement. He said the arthritis is so bad theres no point in trying to fix the rotator cuff,tendens and ligaments!! I Left his office a complete mess. I ended up getting four YES 4 second oppinions and not one has even mentioned arthritis!! I told each Dr what Knapp said (after they diagnose me) and each one said"I have NO idea why he said that?? i can fix your shoulder YOU DON'T NEED A REPLACEMENT!! " Knapp is NOT a good DR. I actually think he's making money from the replacement manufactures! I am happy to say I am scheduled for surgery a GOOD Dr and will be back to the gym in nine months

Dr. Knapp is a fantastic Dr. and a world class surgeon.  I went in to get my Right Shoulder repaired after an acute injury playing a contact sport.  4 years later after heavy weight training and usage of my right shoulder it remains strong and healthy  I've had my left shoulder completely reconstructed as of about 2 years ago with Dr. Knapp as well.  It too has recovered really well.  He's a pro.

Do not have your surgery done by Dr. Knapp.  3 years after my shoulder surgery I am still in pain every day.  He did a really bad job.  He is also very arrogant.  Huge regrets I didn't go to Kerlan Jobe like I had with my previous shoulder surgery.  That one is stronger and better than ever.  What a mistake.  He also over-charged me and I literally just now - 3 YEARS LATER - got a reimbursement check.  So I felt compelled to write on Yelp.  I could almost forgive the other stuff if I didn't still have constant shoulder pain and felt that he repaired my shoulder properly.  I can't believe this guy has such a great reputation.

Happy First Day of Breast Cancer Awareness month to Me!  Dr. Knapp is seemingly ill-equipped and unprofessional in the administration of care.  In late 2014 I was diagnosed with severe frozen shoulder and referred to Dr. Knapp by my primary care physician.  The first visit was great.  In front of several associates Dr. Knapp told me how he was going to do for me what he did for his wife and several other family members who had suffered with frozen shoulder due to breast cancer.  He gave me a cortisone shot, referred me to a different physical therapist from my previous and sent me on my way.  I guess he forgot what he told me in the examination room the first time because he's done anything but.  This office refuses to adequately and expediently submit paperwork for employment and/or insurance verification.  He's offered me no other alternatives to aid the healing of shoulder such as surgical manipulations or anything for which he's supposed to be the Nation's foremost authority.  And communication with him outside of the examination room is ONLY via third party. You don't speak with Dr. Knapp EVER!  When you get an appointment, prepare to wait and if you need paperwork, prepare to fight.  I read one review that gave him an excellent review for my same issue.  I wish I could share in that sentiment but I can't.

I have not yet had surgery wth Dr. Knapp, but I did want to comment on the professionalism of all of his staff members.  They promptly scheduled my appointment and advised me of what I needed to bring with me to the appointment. When I arrived, I was first seen by his Fellow who did a detailed explanation with me of my MRI.  Dr. Knapp ordered another MRI, but this time with contrast, and much to my surprise, he actually called me on Saturday morning, the day he received my MRI results, because, he said, "I know patients are anxious to hear their results."  He answered all my questions on the phone and explained to me what my srugery would entail.  Since then his staff have promptly followed up with me.  If my surgery goes as smoothly as my pre op experience, I will be a happy camper.

Astonishingly badly run office. Extremely difficult to get anyone on the phone. Your appointment with "Dr. Knapp" is mostly run by another Dr, with Knapp coming in for a couple minutes at the end. A few months ago I had to wait four weeks for Knapp to get back to me re: my MRI. When he did, it was some girl named Brandi who was going to send me for more tests, without telling me what Knapp had seen in the MRI or what my diagnosis was. Knapp is supposed to be a great shoulder guy but his office is one of the worst run I've ever experienced.

To be clear, I never actually saw Dr. Knapp. I was too turned off by the poor bedside manner of his staff. They were unsympathetic and completely not helpful. One of the nurses, Brandi, scheduled me for the wrong appointment and then argued with me over it. She had so much attitude that I hobbled out of the office on my crutches- I couldn't bear to stay for the consult.It's hard enough to be injured and to deal with countless doctors, exams and appointments. I don't need obstinance from hospital staff.

I have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Knapp. If you want a doctor who knows and understands shoulders, he's your guy.  I had been suffering from shoulder pain for close to a year and was very close to surgery with my regular orthopedist who I've trusted for years. I was urged by a friend to get a second opinion and was referred to Dr. Knapp. Prior to this appointment, I'd had 2 cortisone shots, physical therapy, chiropractic care, massage therapy, two MRI's and was still in pain.  It turns out that the radiologist who read the films on my first MRI made a mistake and missed the problem and my first doc missed it too.  When I arrived at Dr. Knapp's office, I did not experience any of the problems mentioned in other Yelp reviews. The first doc to see me was a Fellow, who did a preliminary exam prior to Dr. Knapp entering the room. This is a very standard procedure that I've experienced in many other Dr. offices. It was actually the first doc who identified the issue on the films and Dr. Knapp confirmed it (it was a rare genetic abnormality). Once they figured it out, I was given a cortisone shot (finally in the RIGHT place) and after it kicked in, I was 100% cured. I write this after more than 3 months (just to make sure the shot wasn't going to wear off and the pain was going to come back). I am eternally grateful that I saw Dr. Knapp and his staff vs. going under the knife with another doctor!

Incision site has not closed up!  Its been three months and my boyfriend still has a gapping hole in his armpit that is discharging yellow pus.  His surgery was done the second week in MARCH!  We have gone through roll after roll of gauze and bandages. At first Dr. Knapp dug around in the incision with a wooden stick and tried to pull out subcutaneous stitches.  When that didn't work he recommended another round of antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointment.  My boyfriend has gone back week after week to no avail.  Dr. Knapp still has not given my boyfriend a real reason as to why the incision site is not closing up.  When my boyfriend tried to get in to see Dr. Knapp this week they let him know that his three months are almost up.  I guess the doctor gives you up to three months of free appointments post surgery, but after that they will start to charge the patient again.  That makes no sense for someone whose surgery has been botched.  Dr. Knapp does not seem concerned about leaving my boyfriend with a open hole in his armpit.  I guess why should he he has already been paid for the surgery.  At this point Dr. Knapp is not making any more money on my boyfriend by fixing him.  In the mean time my boyfriend has been unable to workout, get in a pool, hot tub, steam room, or sweat in general because of the risk of infection.  The armpit runs one of the highest risks of infection. Again Dr. Knapp does not seem to be concerned or understand how inconvenient that is for an active person. When he tried to get an appointment this week his staff did not return his phone calls.  When you call the office you get an operator who is not even in the office.  When you ask to be transferred to a staff member you almost always get a voicemail.  When you leave a voicemail message for his staff nobody calls you back. When you do get ahold of someone they say they have to call you back but don't.  After leaving three voicemail messages we still have not heard from Dr. Knapp.  One would think a doctor would call his patients back. Read this WARNING before you decide to use this doctor. I wish we had read the reviews below as they seem to be saying the same thing.

OK I have read ALL of the reviews. I am not a woman so I cannot comment on the details related to putting a bra on post surgery... However, I can say that Dr. Knapp called me personally several times post surgery, including on the weekends and met with me on a Saturday with his son in tow because of the dicey recovery I had from a very intricate and difficult shoulder surgery.  The comments regarding his assistant (Brandi) are fair. I am not sure scheduling and patient discussions are her forte. I really didn't appreciate being told to take an Advil when clearly I was having a post surgery complication.I am recovered and thankful for my choice of Dr. Knapp as a surgeon. For me it was a very good decision despite having choices closer to home.

After scheduling my appointment a month in advance, I gathered all of the materials I needed including my MRI report and a DVD of xrays and showed up on time. After a 20 minute wait I was told that the MRI films were needed IN ADDITION to the complete report that I provided which was normal. (Films for normal reports--really? Sounds like a load of crap to me.) And then as I was trying to get the films emailed over I was told I needed to reschedule and was given no opportunity to provide the "necessary" records then and there. Nevermind the fact that another patient showed up AN HOUR late and was given the opportunity to gather additional records as other patients were waiting. Call me crazy, but don't doctors order reports as needed? Why is it necessary to have seen another doctor prior to seeing Knapp. Huh. I was told when I booked the appointment that some of my tests may be too old, and that I would need to repeat them. Which makes me wonder why I was sent off packing before THE DOCTOR could make that assessment HIMSELF, not his administrative assistant who went to community college somewhere near a freeway, I'm sure.I never had the chance to interact with Dr. Knapp, but given how I was treated I will never lay eyes on him. If he wants his office to be run by a total [insert expletive adjective, insert expletive noun], then he can be assured he'll lose out on plenty of business and that the list of negative reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere will grow. This office was completely unprofessional and I will make it my life's mission to ensure that no one I know ever visits anyone any doctor in this practice.

Surgery was not totally successful but perhaps it was the best anyone could have done. Don't know. I understand that he has a good reputation as a surgeon. What I do know is that I routinely waited over 45 minutes past my appointment time for every scheduled appointment before seeing Dr. Knapp. He also has the all time record at any Dr's office in anytime in my life for making me wait 1 hour and 45 minutes past my appointment time to see him. If it wasn't for a needed post surgical follow-up I would have left and seen another Dr. This office clearly clearly over books and in doing so sends patient's the message that their time is not important but the Dr.'s time and their ability to see as many people as possible is very important.

Dr. Knapp is possibly the best orthopedic surgeon the side of the country has to offer. Not only does he have incredible bedside manner [just ask him WHY he wanted to get into medicine...he has such a heart for helping others] but you won't be able to find another doctor who is as brilliant and compassionate as him. I do a ton of research before going to a doctor and found out that not only is he highly praised doctor, but has invented many tools in the medical field that have revolutionized surgery. These tools are now used WORLDWIDE to change the way that surgeons operate. I don't know about you but that to me says alot...a doctor who knows how to fix problems so well that he invents new ways to do it much more accurately. I went to another doctor who had to make 4 incisions on my shoulder but found out after the fact that Dr. Knapp could have done the same procedure with the same results with only 2 incisions. I won't be going to any one else ever again. And as for the wait time...I'd rather see a doctor who everyone is fighting to see because of his incredible skill then walk right into an appointment with someone who isn't as accurate. What's more important to you...wait time or your body getting the best care? I know what my answer is.

I really wish I would have read these reviews prior to scheduling an appointment with Dr. Knapp.  I found his office staff and procedures to be condescending, rude and narassistic.  They insisted that I have an MRI PRIOR to coming in for the appointment, that I bring withme the report and the disk.  They sent me pages of forms to complete.  When I arrived, the receptioinst, Ginger, scolded me for not having completed portions of my paper work in advance of the appointment.  When I explained that the answer to the question depended on the circumstances and that I wanted to speak with the doctor for clarification, she told me firmly, "No.  Dr. Knapp is very picky and wants all of the questions answered before he will see you".  She made several other snappy remarks before I was made to wait to see the Dr.'s medical assistant.  Once I got in to see the medical assistant, she told me that I would need to have an x-ray BEFORE I saw the doctor.  Mind you, the doctor had already insisted that I receive an MRI test and bring with me the disk and report or "he would not see me".  So he had my MRI, why did he need an x-ray now too, that was not mentioned previously, and why should I have to be exposed to radiation, and have my insurance pay for another procdure, PRIOR to my even seeing the doctor?  When I asked to speak with Dr. Knapp the mecial assistnat told me "Sorry, he is very particular and will not talk to you without the x-ray."   Either his poor staff has been so badly mistreaten that they don't dare risk their job by accomodating a patient's reasonable requests, or this Dr. Knapp is a complete narassisist who thinks his time is more important than his patients.  Well, I'm sorry but in Santa Monica there are a lot of important people whose time and money is as (or more) important than Dr. Knapp's, mine included.  So I'll be finding a more professional doctor and staff and taking my business elsewhere.

Believe me, you are far from the only person who ever has had a problem dealing with Brandi.  It's too bad she's such a turnoff, because Knapp is a great orthopedist.

I love love love Dr. Knapp!!  He is an excellent doctor with great bedside manners. He has excellent follow through when it comes to his patients. In fact, I have used him twice (shoulder and knee surgery).  I went to three doctor's regarding my shoulder and they all stated I needed only physical therapy (which made my shoulder worse). One of the doctor's who couldn't figure out what was wrong with my shoulder referred me to Dr. Knapp. Dr. Knapp was the only doctor to suggest a MRI and he found what was wrong with my shoulder. As for Dr. Knapp's staff I have never had a bad experience with them (Brandi or Yoli). In fact, Brandi has only been kind to me and very helpful. Trust me when I say this that if I ever had a bad experience St John's would know and I would post it everywhere. I have had bad experiences with other doctor's at St. John's but not with Dr. Knapp. I'm sorry to hear that some patient's have had a bad experience with Dr Knapp and his staff. I truly have had top notch service and have recommended Dr. Knapp to several of my friends.

After being misdiagnosed by three other doctors, I finally found out what the problem was when I saw Dr. Knapp. With a cortisone shot he did exactly in the right place with very little pain. He is the reason I am basically pain free. 
As with his assistant, Brandi, I had nothing bad to say. She called me right back and was very helpful with appointments.
I have nothing bad to say about Knapp, he is an incredible doctor who really does care about the person.







DO NOT GO TO KNAPP!!! I am a pro fighter and a contractor. Knapp said my arthritis is so bad that I needed a reverse shoulder replacement. He said the arthritis is so bad theres no point in trying to fix the rotator cuff,tendens and ligaments!! I Left his office a complete mess. I ended up getting four YES 4 second oppinions and not one has even mentioned arthritis!! I told each Dr what Knapp said (after they diagnose me) and each one said"I have NO idea why he said that?? i can fix your shoulder YOU DON'T NEED A REPLACEMENT!! " Knapp is NOT a good DR. I actually think he's making money from the replacement manufactures! I am happy to say I am scheduled for surgery a GOOD Dr and will be back to the gym in nine months







Dr. Knapp is a fantastic Dr. and a world class surgeon.  I went in to get my Right Shoulder repaired after an acute injury playing a contact sport.  4 years later after heavy weight training and usage of my right shoulder it remains strong and healthy  I've had my left shoulder completely reconstructed as of about 2 years ago with Dr. Knapp as well.  It too has recovered really well.  He's a pro.







Do not have your surgery done by Dr. Knapp.  3 years after my shoulder surgery I am still in pain every day.  He did a really bad job.  He is also very arrogant.  Huge regrets I didn't go to Kerlan Jobe like I had with my previous shoulder surgery.  That one is stronger and better than ever.  What a mistake.  He also over-charged me and I literally just now - 3 YEARS LATER - got a reimbursement check.  So I felt compelled to write on Yelp.  I could almost forgive the other stuff if I didn't still have constant shoulder pain and felt that he repaired my shoulder properly.  I can't believe this guy has such a great reputation.







Happy First Day of Breast Cancer Awareness month to Me!  Dr. Knapp is seemingly ill-equipped and unprofessional in the administration of care.  In late 2014 I was diagnosed with severe frozen shoulder and referred to Dr. Knapp by my primary care physician.  The first visit was great.  In front of several associates Dr. Knapp told me how he was going to do for me what he did for his wife and several other family members who had suffered with frozen shoulder due to breast cancer.  He gave me a cortisone shot, referred me to a different physical therapist from my previous and sent me on my way.  I guess he forgot what he told me in the examination room the first time because he's done anything but.  This office refuses to adequately and expediently submit paperwork for employment and/or insurance verification.  He's offered me no other alternatives to aid the healing of shoulder such as surgical manipulations or anything for which he's supposed to be the Nation's foremost authority.  And communication with him outside of the examination room is ONLY via third party. You don't speak with Dr. Knapp EVER!  When you get an appointment, prepare to wait and if you need paperwork, prepare to fight.  I read one review that gave him an excellent review for my same issue.  I wish I could share in that sentiment but I can't.







I have not yet had surgery wth Dr. Knapp, but I did want to comment on the professionalism of all of his staff members.  They promptly scheduled my appointment and advised me of what I needed to bring with me to the appointment. When I arrived, I was first seen by his Fellow who did a detailed explanation with me of my MRI.  Dr. Knapp ordered another MRI, but this time with contrast, and much to my surprise, he actually called me on Saturday morning, the day he received my MRI results, because, he said, "I know patients are anxious to hear their results."  He answered all my questions on the phone and explained to me what my srugery would entail.  Since then his staff have promptly followed up with me.  If my surgery goes as smoothly as my pre op experience, I will be a happy camper.







Astonishingly badly run office. Extremely difficult to get anyone on the phone. Your appointment with "Dr. Knapp" is mostly run by another Dr, with Knapp coming in for a couple minutes at the end. 

A few months ago I had to wait four weeks for Knapp to get back to me re: my MRI. When he did, it was some girl named Brandi who was going to send me for more tests, without telling me what Knapp had seen in the MRI or what my diagnosis was. 

Knapp is supposed to be a great shoulder guy but his office is one of the worst run I've ever experienced.







To be clear, I never actually saw Dr. Knapp. I was too turned off by the poor bedside manner of his staff. They were unsympathetic and completely not helpful. 

One of the nurses, Brandi, scheduled me for the wrong appointment and then argued with me over it. She had so much attitude that I hobbled out of the office on my crutches- I couldn't bear to stay for the consult.

It's hard enough to be injured and to deal with countless doctors, exams and appointments. I don't need obstinance from hospital staff.







I have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Knapp. If you want a doctor who knows and understands shoulders, he's your guy.  I had been suffering from shoulder pain for close to a year and was very close to surgery with my regular orthopedist who I've trusted for years. I was urged by a friend to get a second opinion and was referred to Dr. Knapp. Prior to this appointment, I'd had 2 cortisone shots, physical therapy, chiropractic care, massage therapy, two MRI's and was still in pain.  It turns out that the radiologist who read the films on my first MRI made a mistake and missed the problem and my first doc missed it too.  When I arrived at Dr. Knapp's office, I did not experience any of the problems mentioned in other Yelp reviews. The first doc to see me was a Fellow, who did a preliminary exam prior to Dr. Knapp entering the room. This is a very standard procedure that I've experienced in many other Dr. offices. It was actually the first doc who identified the issue on the films and Dr. Knapp confirmed it (it was a rare genetic abnormality). Once they figured it out, I was given a cortisone shot (finally in the RIGHT place) and after it kicked in, I was 100% cured. I write this after more than 3 months (just to make sure the shot wasn't going to wear off and the pain was going to come back). I am eternally grateful that I saw Dr. Knapp and his staff vs. going under the knife with another doctor!







Incision site has not closed up!  Its been three months and my boyfriend still has a gapping hole in his armpit that is discharging yellow pus.  His surgery was done the second week in MARCH!  We have gone through roll after roll of gauze and bandages. At first Dr. Knapp dug around in the incision with a wooden stick and tried to pull out subcutaneous stitches.  When that didn't work he recommended another round of antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointment.  My boyfriend has gone back week after week to no avail.  Dr. Knapp still has not given my boyfriend a real reason as to why the incision site is not closing up.  When my boyfriend tried to get in to see Dr. Knapp this week they let him know that his three months are almost up.  I guess the doctor gives you up to three months of free appointments post surgery, but after that they will start to charge the patient again.  That makes no sense for someone whose surgery has been botched.  Dr. Knapp does not seem concerned about leaving my boyfriend with a open hole in his armpit.  I guess why should he he has already been paid for the surgery.  At this point Dr. Knapp is not making any more money on my boyfriend by fixing him.  In the mean time my boyfriend has been unable to workout, get in a pool, hot tub, steam room, or sweat in general because of the risk of infection.  The armpit runs one of the highest risks of infection. Again Dr. Knapp does not seem to be concerned or understand how inconvenient that is for an active person. When he tried to get an appointment this week his staff did not return his phone calls.  When you call the office you get an operator who is not even in the office.  When you ask to be transferred to a staff member you almost always get a voicemail.  When you leave a voicemail message for his staff nobody calls you back. When you do get ahold of someone they say they have to call you back but don't.  After leaving three voicemail messages we still have not heard from Dr. Knapp.  One would think a doctor would call his patients back. Read this WARNING before you decide to use this doctor. I wish we had read the reviews below as they seem to be saying the same thing.







OK I have read ALL of the reviews. I am not a woman so I cannot comment on the details related to putting a bra on post surgery... However, I can say that Dr. Knapp called me personally several times post surgery, including on the weekends and met with me on a Saturday with his son in tow because of the dicey recovery I had from a very intricate and difficult shoulder surgery.  The comments regarding his assistant (Brandi) are fair. I am not sure scheduling and patient discussions are her forte. I really didn't appreciate being told to take an Advil when clearly I was having a post surgery complication.

I am recovered and thankful for my choice of Dr. Knapp as a surgeon. For me it was a very good decision despite having choices closer to home.







After scheduling my appointment a month in advance, I gathered all of the materials I needed including my MRI report and a DVD of xrays and showed up on time. 
After a 20 minute wait I was told that the MRI films were needed IN ADDITION to the complete report that I provided which was normal. (Films for normal reports--really? Sounds like a load of crap to me.) And then as I was trying to get the films emailed over I was told I needed to reschedule and was given no opportunity to provide the "necessary" records then and there. Nevermind the fact that another patient showed up AN HOUR late and was given the opportunity to gather additional records as other patients were waiting. 

Call me crazy, but don't doctors order reports as needed? Why is it necessary to have seen another doctor prior to seeing Knapp. Huh. I was told when I booked the appointment that some of my tests may be too old, and that I would need to repeat them. Which makes me wonder why I was sent off packing before THE DOCTOR could make that assessment HIMSELF, not his administrative assistant who went to community college somewhere near a freeway, I'm sure.

I never had the chance to interact with Dr. Knapp, but given how I was treated I will never lay eyes on him. If he wants his office to be run by a total [insert expletive adjective, insert expletive noun], then he can be assured he'll lose out on plenty of business and that the list of negative reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere will grow. This office was completely unprofessional and I will make it my life's mission to ensure that no one I know ever visits anyone any doctor in this practice.







Surgery was not totally successful but perhaps it was the best anyone could have done. Don't know. I understand that he has a good reputation as a surgeon. 

What I do know is that I routinely waited over 45 minutes past my appointment time for every scheduled appointment before seeing Dr. Knapp. He also has the all time record at any Dr's office in anytime in my life for making me wait 1 hour and 45 minutes past my appointment time to see him. If it wasn't for a needed post surgical follow-up I would have left and seen another Dr. 

This office clearly clearly over books and in doing so sends patient's the message that their time is not important but the Dr.'s time and their ability to see as many people as possible is very important.







Dr. Knapp is possibly the best orthopedic surgeon the side of the country has to offer. Not only does he have incredible bedside manner [just ask him WHY he wanted to get into medicine...he has such a heart for helping others] but you won't be able to find another doctor who is as brilliant and compassionate as him. I do a ton of research before going to a doctor and found out that not only is he highly praised doctor, but has invented many tools in the medical field that have revolutionized surgery. These tools are now used WORLDWIDE to change the way that surgeons operate. I don't know about you but that to me says alot...a doctor who knows how to fix problems so well that he invents new ways to do it much more accurately. I went to another doctor who had to make 4 incisions on my shoulder but found out after the fact that Dr. Knapp could have done the same procedure with the same results with only 2 incisions. I won't be going to any one else ever again. And as for the wait time...I'd rather see a doctor who everyone is fighting to see because of his incredible skill then walk right into an appointment with someone who isn't as accurate. What's more important to you...wait time or your body getting the best care? I know what my answer is.







I really wish I would have read these reviews prior to scheduling an appointment with Dr. Knapp.  I found his office staff and procedures to be condescending, rude and narassistic.  They insisted that I have an MRI PRIOR to coming in for the appointment, that I bring withme the report and the disk.  They sent me pages of forms to complete.  When I arrived, the receptioinst, Ginger, scolded me for not having completed portions of my paper work in advance of the appointment.  When I explained that the answer to the question depended on the circumstances and that I wanted to speak with the doctor for clarification, she told me firmly, "No.  Dr. Knapp is very picky and wants all of the questions answered before he will see you".  She made several other snappy remarks before I was made to wait to see the Dr.'s medical assistant.  

Once I got in to see the medical assistant, she told me that I would need to have an x-ray BEFORE I saw the doctor.  Mind you, the doctor had already insisted that I receive an MRI test and bring with me the disk and report or "he would not see me".  So he had my MRI, why did he need an x-ray now too, that was not mentioned previously, and why should I have to be exposed to radiation, and have my insurance pay for another procdure, PRIOR to my even seeing the doctor?  When I asked to speak with Dr. Knapp the mecial assistnat told me "Sorry, he is very particular and will not talk to you without the x-ray."   Either his poor staff has been so badly mistreaten that they don't dare risk their job by accomodating a patient's reasonable requests, or this Dr. Knapp is a complete narassisist who thinks his time is more important than his patients.  Well, I'm sorry but in Santa Monica there are a lot of important people whose time and money is as (or more) important than Dr. Knapp's, mine included.  So I'll be finding a more professional doctor and staff and taking my business elsewhere.







Believe me, you are far from the only person who ever has had a problem dealing with Brandi.  It's too bad she's such a turnoff, because Knapp is a great orthopedist.







I love love love Dr. Knapp!!  He is an excellent doctor with great bedside manners. He has excellent follow through when it comes to his patients. In fact, I have used him twice (shoulder and knee surgery).  I went to three doctor's regarding my shoulder and they all stated I needed only physical therapy (which made my shoulder worse). One of the doctor's who couldn't figure out what was wrong with my shoulder referred me to Dr. Knapp. Dr. Knapp was the only doctor to suggest a MRI and he found what was wrong with my shoulder. As for Dr. Knapp's staff I have never had a bad experience with them (Brandi or Yoli). In fact, Brandi has only been kind to me and very helpful. Trust me when I say this that if I ever had a bad experience St John's would know and I would post it everywhere. I have had bad experiences with other doctor's at St. John's but not with Dr. Knapp. I'm sorry to hear that some patient's have had a bad experience with Dr Knapp and his staff. I truly have had top notch service and have recommended Dr. Knapp to several of my friends.

After being misdiagnosed by three other doctors, I finally found out what the problem was when I saw Dr. Knapp. With a cortisone shot he did exactly in the right place with very little pain. He is the reason I am basically pain free. As with his assistant, Brandi, I had nothing bad to say. She called me right back and was very helpful with appointments.I have nothing bad to say about Knapp, he is an incredible doctor who really does care about the person.

DO NOT GO TO KNAPP!!! I am a pro fighter and a contractor. Knapp said my arthritis is so bad that I needed a reverse shoulder replacement. He said the arthritis is so bad theres no point in trying to fix the rotator cuff,tendens and ligaments!! I Left his office a complete mess. I ended up getting four YES 4 second oppinions and not one has even mentioned arthritis!! I told each Dr what Knapp said (after they diagnose me) and each one said"I have NO idea why he said that?? i can fix your shoulder YOU DON'T NEED A REPLACEMENT!! " Knapp is NOT a good DR. I actually think he's making money from the replacement manufactures! I am happy to say I am scheduled for surgery a GOOD Dr and will be back to the gym in nine months

Dr. Knapp is a fantastic Dr. and a world class surgeon.  I went in to get my Right Shoulder repaired after an acute injury playing a contact sport.  4 years later after heavy weight training and usage of my right shoulder it remains strong and healthy  I've had my left shoulder completely reconstructed as of about 2 years ago with Dr. Knapp as well.  It too has recovered really well.  He's a pro.

Do not have your surgery done by Dr. Knapp.  3 years after my shoulder surgery I am still in pain every day.  He did a really bad job.  He is also very arrogant.  Huge regrets I didn't go to Kerlan Jobe like I had with my previous shoulder surgery.  That one is stronger and better than ever.  What a mistake.  He also over-charged me and I literally just now - 3 YEARS LATER - got a reimbursement check.  So I felt compelled to write on Yelp.  I could almost forgive the other stuff if I didn't still have constant shoulder pain and felt that he repaired my shoulder properly.  I can't believe this guy has such a great reputation.

Happy First Day of Breast Cancer Awareness month to Me!  Dr. Knapp is seemingly ill-equipped and unprofessional in the administration of care.  In late 2014 I was diagnosed with severe frozen shoulder and referred to Dr. Knapp by my primary care physician.  The first visit was great.  In front of several associates Dr. Knapp told me how he was going to do for me what he did for his wife and several other family members who had suffered with frozen shoulder due to breast cancer.  He gave me a cortisone shot, referred me to a different physical therapist from my previous and sent me on my way.  I guess he forgot what he told me in the examination room the first time because he's done anything but.  This office refuses to adequately and expediently submit paperwork for employment and/or insurance verification.  He's offered me no other alternatives to aid the healing of shoulder such as surgical manipulations or anything for which he's supposed to be the Nation's foremost authority.  And communication with him outside of the examination room is ONLY via third party. You don't speak with Dr. Knapp EVER!  When you get an appointment, prepare to wait and if you need paperwork, prepare to fight.  I read one review that gave him an excellent review for my same issue.  I wish I could share in that sentiment but I can't.

I have not yet had surgery wth Dr. Knapp, but I did want to comment on the professionalism of all of his staff members.  They promptly scheduled my appointment and advised me of what I needed to bring with me to the appointment. When I arrived, I was first seen by his Fellow who did a detailed explanation with me of my MRI.  Dr. Knapp ordered another MRI, but this time with contrast, and much to my surprise, he actually called me on Saturday morning, the day he received my MRI results, because, he said, "I know patients are anxious to hear their results."  He answered all my questions on the phone and explained to me what my srugery would entail.  Since then his staff have promptly followed up with me.  If my surgery goes as smoothly as my pre op experience, I will be a happy camper.

Astonishingly badly run office. Extremely difficult to get anyone on the phone. Your appointment with "Dr. Knapp" is mostly run by another Dr, with Knapp coming in for a couple minutes at the end. A few months ago I had to wait four weeks for Knapp to get back to me re: my MRI. When he did, it was some girl named Brandi who was going to send me for more tests, without telling me what Knapp had seen in the MRI or what my diagnosis was. Knapp is supposed to be a great shoulder guy but his office is one of the worst run I've ever experienced.

To be clear, I never actually saw Dr. Knapp. I was too turned off by the poor bedside manner of his staff. They were unsympathetic and completely not helpful. One of the nurses, Brandi, scheduled me for the wrong appointment and then argued with me over it. She had so much attitude that I hobbled out of the office on my crutches- I couldn't bear to stay for the consult.It's hard enough to be injured and to deal with countless doctors, exams and appointments. I don't need obstinance from hospital staff.

I have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Knapp. If you want a doctor who knows and understands shoulders, he's your guy.  I had been suffering from shoulder pain for close to a year and was very close to surgery with my regular orthopedist who I've trusted for years. I was urged by a friend to get a second opinion and was referred to Dr. Knapp. Prior to this appointment, I'd had 2 cortisone shots, physical therapy, chiropractic care, massage therapy, two MRI's and was still in pain.  It turns out that the radiologist who read the films on my first MRI made a mistake and missed the problem and my first doc missed it too.  When I arrived at Dr. Knapp's office, I did not experience any of the problems mentioned in other Yelp reviews. The first doc to see me was a Fellow, who did a preliminary exam prior to Dr. Knapp entering the room. This is a very standard procedure that I've experienced in many other Dr. offices. It was actually the first doc who identified the issue on the films and Dr. Knapp confirmed it (it was a rare genetic abnormality). Once they figured it out, I was given a cortisone shot (finally in the RIGHT place) and after it kicked in, I was 100% cured. I write this after more than 3 months (just to make sure the shot wasn't going to wear off and the pain was going to come back). I am eternally grateful that I saw Dr. Knapp and his staff vs. going under the knife with another doctor!

Incision site has not closed up!  Its been three months and my boyfriend still has a gapping hole in his armpit that is discharging yellow pus.  His surgery was done the second week in MARCH!  We have gone through roll after roll of gauze and bandages. At first Dr. Knapp dug around in the incision with a wooden stick and tried to pull out subcutaneous stitches.  When that didn't work he recommended another round of antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointment.  My boyfriend has gone back week after week to no avail.  Dr. Knapp still has not given my boyfriend a real reason as to why the incision site is not closing up.  When my boyfriend tried to get in to see Dr. Knapp this week they let him know that his three months are almost up.  I guess the doctor gives you up to three months of free appointments post surgery, but after that they will start to charge the patient again.  That makes no sense for someone whose surgery has been botched.  Dr. Knapp does not seem concerned about leaving my boyfriend with a open hole in his armpit.  I guess why should he he has already been paid for the surgery.  At this point Dr. Knapp is not making any more money on my boyfriend by fixing him.  In the mean time my boyfriend has been unable to workout, get in a pool, hot tub, steam room, or sweat in general because of the risk of infection.  The armpit runs one of the highest risks of infection. Again Dr. Knapp does not seem to be concerned or understand how inconvenient that is for an active person. When he tried to get an appointment this week his staff did not return his phone calls.  When you call the office you get an operator who is not even in the office.  When you ask to be transferred to a staff member you almost always get a voicemail.  When you leave a voicemail message for his staff nobody calls you back. When you do get ahold of someone they say they have to call you back but don't.  After leaving three voicemail messages we still have not heard from Dr. Knapp.  One would think a doctor would call his patients back. Read this WARNING before you decide to use this doctor. I wish we had read the reviews below as they seem to be saying the same thing.

OK I have read ALL of the reviews. I am not a woman so I cannot comment on the details related to putting a bra on post surgery... However, I can say that Dr. Knapp called me personally several times post surgery, including on the weekends and met with me on a Saturday with his son in tow because of the dicey recovery I had from a very intricate and difficult shoulder surgery.  The comments regarding his assistant (Brandi) are fair. I am not sure scheduling and patient discussions are her forte. I really didn't appreciate being told to take an Advil when clearly I was having a post surgery complication.I am recovered and thankful for my choice of Dr. Knapp as a surgeon. For me it was a very good decision despite having choices closer to home.

After scheduling my appointment a month in advance, I gathered all of the materials I needed including my MRI report and a DVD of xrays and showed up on time. After a 20 minute wait I was told that the MRI films were needed IN ADDITION to the complete report that I provided which was normal. (Films for normal reports--really? Sounds like a load of crap to me.) And then as I was trying to get the films emailed over I was told I needed to reschedule and was given no opportunity to provide the "necessary" records then and there. Nevermind the fact that another patient showed up AN HOUR late and was given the opportunity to gather additional records as other patients were waiting. Call me crazy, but don't doctors order reports as needed? Why is it necessary to have seen another doctor prior to seeing Knapp. Huh. I was told when I booked the appointment that some of my tests may be too old, and that I would need to repeat them. Which makes me wonder why I was sent off packing before THE DOCTOR could make that assessment HIMSELF, not his administrative assistant who went to community college somewhere near a freeway, I'm sure.I never had the chance to interact with Dr. Knapp, but given how I was treated I will never lay eyes on him. If he wants his office to be run by a total [insert expletive adjective, insert expletive noun], then he can be assured he'll lose out on plenty of business and that the list of negative reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere will grow. This office was completely unprofessional and I will make it my life's mission to ensure that no one I know ever visits anyone any doctor in this practice.

Surgery was not totally successful but perhaps it was the best anyone could have done. Don't know. I understand that he has a good reputation as a surgeon. What I do know is that I routinely waited over 45 minutes past my appointment time for every scheduled appointment before seeing Dr. Knapp. He also has the all time record at any Dr's office in anytime in my life for making me wait 1 hour and 45 minutes past my appointment time to see him. If it wasn't for a needed post surgical follow-up I would have left and seen another Dr. This office clearly clearly over books and in doing so sends patient's the message that their time is not important but the Dr.'s time and their ability to see as many people as possible is very important.

Dr. Knapp is possibly the best orthopedic surgeon the side of the country has to offer. Not only does he have incredible bedside manner [just ask him WHY he wanted to get into medicine...he has such a heart for helping others] but you won't be able to find another doctor who is as brilliant and compassionate as him. I do a ton of research before going to a doctor and found out that not only is he highly praised doctor, but has invented many tools in the medical field that have revolutionized surgery. These tools are now used WORLDWIDE to change the way that surgeons operate. I don't know about you but that to me says alot...a doctor who knows how to fix problems so well that he invents new ways to do it much more accurately. I went to another doctor who had to make 4 incisions on my shoulder but found out after the fact that Dr. Knapp could have done the same procedure with the same results with only 2 incisions. I won't be going to any one else ever again. And as for the wait time...I'd rather see a doctor who everyone is fighting to see because of his incredible skill then walk right into an appointment with someone who isn't as accurate. What's more important to you...wait time or your body getting the best care? I know what my answer is.

I really wish I would have read these reviews prior to scheduling an appointment with Dr. Knapp.  I found his office staff and procedures to be condescending, rude and narassistic.  They insisted that I have an MRI PRIOR to coming in for the appointment, that I bring withme the report and the disk.  They sent me pages of forms to complete.  When I arrived, the receptioinst, Ginger, scolded me for not having completed portions of my paper work in advance of the appointment.  When I explained that the answer to the question depended on the circumstances and that I wanted to speak with the doctor for clarification, she told me firmly, "No.  Dr. Knapp is very picky and wants all of the questions answered before he will see you".  She made several other snappy remarks before I was made to wait to see the Dr.'s medical assistant.  Once I got in to see the medical assistant, she told me that I would need to have an x-ray BEFORE I saw the doctor.  Mind you, the doctor had already insisted that I receive an MRI test and bring with me the disk and report or "he would not see me".  So he had my MRI, why did he need an x-ray now too, that was not mentioned previously, and why should I have to be exposed to radiation, and have my insurance pay for another procdure, PRIOR to my even seeing the doctor?  When I asked to speak with Dr. Knapp the mecial assistnat told me "Sorry, he is very particular and will not talk to you without the x-ray."   Either his poor staff has been so badly mistreaten that they don't dare risk their job by accomodating a patient's reasonable requests, or this Dr. Knapp is a complete narassisist who thinks his time is more important than his patients.  Well, I'm sorry but in Santa Monica there are a lot of important people whose time and money is as (or more) important than Dr. Knapp's, mine included.  So I'll be finding a more professional doctor and staff and taking my business elsewhere.

I love love love Dr. Knapp!!  He is an excellent doctor with great bedside manners. He has excellent follow through when it comes to his patients. In fact, I have used him twice (shoulder and knee surgery).  I went to three doctor's regarding my shoulder and they all stated I needed only physical therapy (which made my shoulder worse). One of the doctor's who couldn't figure out what was wrong with my shoulder referred me to Dr. Knapp. Dr. Knapp was the only doctor to suggest a MRI and he found what was wrong with my shoulder. As for Dr. Knapp's staff I have never had a bad experience with them (Brandi or Yoli). In fact, Brandi has only been kind to me and very helpful. Trust me when I say this that if I ever had a bad experience St John's would know and I would post it everywhere. I have had bad experiences with other doctor's at St. John's but not with Dr. Knapp. I'm sorry to hear that some patient's have had a bad experience with Dr Knapp and his staff. I truly have had top notch service and have recommended Dr. Knapp to several of my friends.

It’s Time to End America’s Longest War

by Thomas Knapp
 by 
TweetEmail


In the latest round of saber-rattling between the US and North Korean governments, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson laid down the well-worn line. “All options,” he said during a visit to South Korea, “are on the table.”
If he’s serious, here’s an option that never seems to get much discussion lately:
US president Donald Trump should send Tillerson to tell Yun Byung-se, his counterpart in Seoul, that the US is withdrawing its troops from the Korean peninsula by a specific date, and that after that date the US will cease to guarantee, or accept responsibility for, the South’s security.
If the Korean War was a person, it would be old enough to collect Social Security benefits. It began on June 25, 1950 when the armed forces of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (“North Korea”) invaded the Republic of Korea (“South Korea”).
Coming up on 67 years later, it continues. The two Korean regimes still consider themselves at war, the US government still keeps nearly 30,000 US troops deployed along the ironically named “Demilitarized Zone” separating the two countries, and the situation remains as tense and sporadically violent as ever since 1953 when a temporary ceasefire was signed.
Today, South Korea is twice as populous and 35 times as wealthy (in terms of Gross Domestic Product) as the North, boasting the 11th largest economy in the world (North Korea ranks 113th).
In what universe does it make sense for American taxpayers to continue picking up a substantial portion of the check for South Korea’s defense from its smaller, poorer, less industrially advanced neighbor?
Once upon a time, at least briefly, this was a Republican talking point. In 2004, president George W. Bush announced his intent to withdraw thousands of US troops from South Korea over several years.
He did so in a campaign speech in New Mexico — a state he lost in 2000 by fewer votes than Libertarian Harry Browne received, during a visit intended to prevent a similar performance by 2004 Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik. For an ever so brief moment, Bush faked a peacenik end run around both Badnarik and Democratic candidate John Kerry on the subject of North and South Korea.
Of course, it was back to business as usual, and to North Korea as all-purpose bogeyman, once Bush managed to get re-elected that November. But at least he was willing to broach the subject. Trump and Tillerson should do likewise — and then follow through.

We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.








The Amazon.com eTextbooks Store




Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Well, you can save up to 80% off the print list price when you rent and up to 60% off the print list price when you buy eTextbooks. Renting eTextbooks couldn’t be easier.
