  The information in this preliminary prospectus supplement is not
complete and may be changed. This preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are not an offer to sell these securities and they are not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not
permitted.    Subject To Completion
 Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated August 9, 2016 
PROSPECTUS    SUPPLEMENT 
(To prospectus dated November 1, 2013) 
$200,000,000   
  

 Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. 
5.875% Senior Notes due 2024   
  The Company 
Kennedy-Wilson is a global real estate investment company. We own, operate and invest in real estate both on our own and through our
investment management platform. We focus on multifamily and commercial properties located in the Western United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan. To complement our investment business, we also provide real estate
services primarily to financial services clients. We have over 500 employees in 25 offices and manage and work with over 5,000 operating associates. We have an ownership interest in approximately 40 million square feet of property globally,
including 25,396 multifamily rental units. In addition to our core income producing real estate, we engage in redevelopment and value-add initiatives that are designed to enhance cash flows or reposition assets to increase disposal values. 
The Offering  The notes offered hereby (the
notes) will be issued as additional notes under the indenture pursuant to which we have previously issued an aggregate of $650.0 million principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 (the initial notes). The notes
offered hereby will have substantially identical terms as the initial notes and will be treated as a single series with the initial notes under the indenture. Holders of the notes offered hereby and the initial notes will vote as one class under the
indenture.  The Notes   



 
Issuer: The notes will be issued by Kennedy-Wilson, Inc., whom we refer to as Kennedy-Wilson, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc., whom we refer to as Kennedy-Wilson Holdings.
  



 
Maturity: The notes will mature on April 1, 2024.   



 
Interest Payments: The notes will pay cash interest, semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2016. 
 



 
Guarantees: The notes will be guaranteed by Kennedy-Wilson Holdings and, subject to certain exceptions, its material existing and future domestic subsidiaries. 
 



 
Ranking: The notes and the guarantees will be senior unsecured obligations. They will rank equally in right of payment with existing and future senior indebtedness of Kennedy-Wilson and the guarantors and
senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of Kennedy-Wilson and the guarantors. The notes will be effectively subordinated to all of Kennedy-Wilsons and the guarantors secured debt to the extent of
the value of the assets securing that debt and structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of Kennedy-Wilsons subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. 
 



 
Optional Redemption: At any time prior to April 1, 2019, Kennedy-Wilson may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus an applicable
make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, as described in this prospectus supplement. At any time and from time to time on or after April 1, 2019, Kennedy-Wilson may redeem the notes, in whole or
in part, at the redemption prices specified under Description of the NotesOptional Redemption, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Prior to April 1, 2017, Kennedy-Wilson may redeem up to 35% of the
notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings. There is no sinking fund for the notes.  Use of Proceeds 
We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes to repay $60.0 million of our outstanding balance under
our unsecured revolving credit facility, and the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions, co-investments, capital expenditures and the repayment of other outstanding indebtedness. 
Investing in the notes involves a high degree of risk. Before buying any notes, you should read the material risks of investing in the notes
included or referred to under the heading Risk Factors beginning on page S-20 of this prospectus supplement. The notes are expected to be rated below investment grade and are subject to the risks
associated with non-investment grade securities.  Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission
has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

accompanying prospectus and may not contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should carefully read this together with the entire prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, and the documents incorporated by

Our Company 
Kennedy-Wilson is a global real estate investment company. We own, operate, and invest in real estate both on our own and through our
investment management platform. We focus on multifamily and commercial properties located in the Western United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan. To complement our investment business, we also provide real estate services
primarily to financial services clients. We have over 500 employees in 25 offices and manage and work with over 5,000 operating associates. 
Our value is primarily derived from our ownership of income-producing real estate assets. We have an ownership interest in approximately 40
million square feet of property globally, including 25,396 multifamily rental units. In addition to our core income-producing real estate, we engage in redevelopment and value-add initiatives that are designed to enhance cash flows or reposition
assets to increase disposal value. Additionally, as of June 30, 2016, our investment management and property services business manages over $17 billion of investment management and other real estate services assets under management, or IMRES AUM,
the majority of which we have an ownership interest in and the balance of which we manage for third parties.  The following is our
business model:   


 

 
Identify countries and markets with an attractive investment landscape.   


 

 
Establish operating platforms in our target markets.   


 

 
Develop local intelligence and create long-lasting relationships, primarily with financial institutions.   


 

 
Leverage relationships and local knowledge to drive proprietary investment opportunities with a focus on off-market transactions that we expect will result in above-average cash flows and returns over the long term.
  


 

 
Acquire high quality assets either on our own or with strategic partners, utilizing cash from our balance sheet (funded by cash flows from operations, refinancing of current investments, investments sales or the sale of
equity or debt securities) and typically financing them on a long-term basis.   


 

 
Reposition assets and enhance cash flows post-acquisition.   


 

 
Explore development opportunities on underutilized portions of assets, primarily excess land with little or no basis adjacent to income-producing properties. 
 


 

 
Continuously evaluate and selectively harvest asset and entity value through strategic realizations utilizing both the public and private markets. 
 


 

 
Utilize our services businesses to meet client needs, strengthen relationships with financial institutions and position us as a valuable resource and partner to these institutions for any future real estate
opportunities.

Table of Contents

IMRES AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which
we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans and investments in joint ventures. Our IMRES AUM is principally intended to reflect the extent
of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. Our IMRES AUM consists of the total estimated fair value of the real estate properties and other real estate related assets either owned by third parties,
wholly owned by us or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in our
IMRES AUM. The estimated value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost.  Our operating associates generally are
individuals that are employed by or affiliated with third-party consultants, contractors, property managers or other service providers that we manage and oversee on a day-to-day basis with respect to our investments and services businesses. 
Our Business Segments 
Our operations are defined by two core business units: KW Investments and KW Investment Management and Real Estate Services, or KW IMRES. KW
Investments invests our capital in real estate-related assets. KW IMRES is a niche business that provides a full array of real estate-related services to us and our investment partners, third party owners and lenders, with a strong focus on
financial institution based clients. Included in KW IMRES is our management of Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate plc, or KWE (LSE: KWE), a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange. The two segments have a symbiotic relationship and work
closely together. KW IMRES provides insight and creates investment opportunities for KW Investments while KW Investments provides clients with the ability to utilize the capabilities of KW IMRES. 
KW Investments  We invest
our capital in real estate assets and loans secured by real estate either on our own or through our investment management platform. When we have partners, we are typically the general partner in the arrangement with a promoted interest in the
profits of our investments beyond our ownership percentage. We had an average ownership interest across all investments of approximately 39% as of June 30, 2016. Our equity partners include public shareholders, financial institutions, foundations,
endowments, high net worth individuals and other institutional investors. Since becoming a listed company on The New York Stock Exchange on November 13, 2009, the Company has realized a 33% IRR and 1.9x equity multiple to Kennedy Wilson on
completed real estate investments.  The following are product types we invest in through the KW Investments segment: 
Multifamily  We pursue multifamily
acquisition opportunities where we believe we can unlock value through a myriad of strategies, including institutional management, asset rehabilitation, repositioning and creative recapitalization. We focus primarily on apartments in
supply-constrained, infill markets. Through our Vintage Housing Holdings partnership, we also utilize low-income housing tax credit structures for income- and age-restricted properties. As of June 30, 2016, we held investments in 25,396 multifamily
apartment units across 133 properties primarily located in the Western United States, Ireland, United Kingdom and Japan.  Commercial 
We source, acquire, and finance various types of commercial real estate, which includes office, industrial, retail and mixed-use assets. After
acquisition, the properties are generally repositioned to enhance

market value. Assets are either sold as part of property-specific investment strategies designed to deliver above-market returns to our clients and shareholders or held if producing above average
cash flows. As of June 30, 2016, we owned interests in 312 commercial properties, totaling over 18.5 million square feet, located throughout the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan. 
Loan Originations and Discounted Loan Purchases 
We acquire or originate loans secured by real estate. Our acquisitions and originations include individual notes on all real estate property
types as well as portfolios of loans purchased from financial institutions, corporations and government agencies. We deliver value through loan resolutions, discounted payoffs and sales. We also convert certain loans into a direct ownership of the
underlying real estate collateral. Our discounted loan pool portfolio as of June 30, 2016 had a current unpaid principal balance of $328.7 million. 
Our loan investment portfolio is principally related to loans acquired at a discount from their contractual balance due as a result of
deteriorated credit quality of the borrower. Such loans are underwritten by us based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral. Due to the discounted purchase price, we seek and are generally able to accomplish near-term realization of
the loan in a cash settlement or by obtaining title to the property. Accordingly, the credit quality of the borrower is not of substantial importance to our evaluation of the risk of recovery from the investment. 
Hotel  We acquire hotels in certain
opportunistic situations in which we are able to purchase at a significant discount to replacement cost or can implement our value-add investment approach. 
Residential and Other  In certain cases,
we may pursue for sale housing acquisition opportunities, including land for entitlements, finished lots, urban infill housing sites and partially finished and finished housing projects. On certain income-producing acquisitions, there are adjacent
land parcels to which we assign little or no basis and for which we may pursue entitlement activities or, in some cases, development or re-development opportunities. This group also includes our investment in marketable securities. Included in our
Western United States residential investments are three residential investments and one loan investment in Hawaii. Our investment account balance for these Hawaiian investments was $158.2 million as of June 30, 2016. 
While our core investments have been in the specific markets and locations listed above, we continue to evaluate opportunities to earn
above-market returns across many other segments and geographic locations.  Investment Account 
Our investment account represents the carrying value of our equity invested before depreciation and amortization. 
As of June 30, 2016, we and our equity partners held a real estate and real estate-related investment portfolio with assets at a book value of
approximately $11.0 billion. We had an average ownership interest across all of our investments of approximately 39% as of June 30, 2016.

KW Investment Management and Real Estate Services 
KW IMRES includes both our investment management platform as well as our third party services business and offers a comprehensive line of real
estate services for the full lifecycle of real estate ownership to clients that include shareholders of KWE, financial institutions, institutional investors, insurance companies, developers, builders and government agencies. KW IMRES has five main
lines of business: investment management, property services, research, brokerage and auction and conventional sales. These five business lines generate revenue for us through fees and commissions. 
We manage approximately 60 million square feet of properties for us and our investment partners (including KWE) in the United States, Europe
and Asia, which include assets we have ownership interests in and third party-owned assets. With 25 offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Jersey, Spain, Italy and Japan, we have the capabilities and resources to provide
property services to real estate owners as well as the experience, as a real estate investor, to understand client concerns. The managers of KW IMRES have an extensive track record in their respective lines of business and in the real estate
community as a whole. Their knowledge and relationships are an excellent driver of businesses through the services business as well as on the investment front. 
Additionally, KW IMRES plays a critical role in supporting our investment strategy by providing local market intelligence and real-time data
for evaluating investments, generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies. 
Investment Management  Our investment
management division provides acquisition, asset management and disposition services to our equity partners as well as to third parties. Currently, we have seven closed-end funds for which we serve as general partner and manager and separate accounts
with strategic partners. In addition, we serve as the manager of KWE and are entitled to receive management fees (50% of which are paid in KWE shares) equal to 1% of KWEs adjusted net asset value and certain performance fees. 
KWE closed its initial public offering in February 2014 and a follow-on offering in October 2014, raising an aggregate of approximately
£1.35 billion in gross proceeds. KWE, whose ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchanges main market and who is a member of the FTSE 250 Index, acquires real estate and real estate-related assets in Europe. As of June 30,
2016, KWE had a portfolio value of $4.1 billion with its assets located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and Italy. As of June 30, 2016, Kennedy-Wilson held approximately 29.4 million ordinary shares of KWE (with a cost basis of $483.9
million), or approximately 21.6% of the total issued share capital of KWE.  KWE is externally managed by one of our wholly owned
subsidiaries, whom we refer to as KWE Manager, pursuant to an investment management agreement whereby we are entitled to receive certain management and performance fees. KWE Manager is entitled to an annual management fee (payable quarterly in
arrears) equal to 1% of KWEs adjusted net asset value and certain performance fees. The management fee payable to KWE Manager is paid half in cash and half in shares of KWE. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the year ended December
31, 2015, KWH earned $11.6 million and $23.3 million, respectively, in management fees.  We are also entitled to receive an annual
performance fee equal to 20% of the lesser of (i) the excess of the shareholder return for the relevant year (defined as the change in KWEs adjusted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends paid) over a 10% annual return hurdle; and
(ii) the excess of year-end adjusted net asset value per ordinary share over a high water mark. The performance fee is payable in shares of KWE that vest equally over a three-year period. 
 
  S-6 


Table of Contents

Due to the terms of the investment management agreement and our equity ownership interest in
KWE, the results and financial position of KWE are consolidated in our financial statements. As such, fees earned by KWE Manager are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to the investment management agreement, subject to
certain exceptions, KWE will be provided priority access to all real estate or real estate loan opportunities sourced by us in Europe that are within the parameters of KWEs investment policy. Compensation and certain general and administrative
expenses relating to KWE are borne by Kennedy-Wilson, as our employees work on behalf of KWE Manager.  Property Services 
Our property services division manages commercial real estate for third-party clients, fund investors and investments held by us. In addition
to earning property management fees, consulting fees, leasing commissions, construction management fees, disposition fees and accounting fees, the property services division gives us insight into local markets and potential acquisitions. Leveraging
over 38 years of real estate experience, we approach property management from the perspective of an owner and are active in identifying and implementing value creation strategies. The division has a proven track record of success in managing
stabilized as well as value-add investments.  Research 
Meyers Research LLC, or Meyers, a Kennedy-Wilson company, is a premier consulting practice and provider of data for residential real estate
development and the new home construction industry. Meyers offers a national perspective as well as local expertise to homebuilders, multifamily developers, lenders and financial institutions. These relationships have led to investment
opportunities with homebuilders in the Western United States. We believe Zonda, a Meyers innovation launched in October 2013, is the housing industrys most comprehensive solution for smart business analysis, real-time market data
reporting and economic and housing data in one place and on-the-go.  Brokerage 
Our brokerage division represents tenants and landlords on every aspect of site selection, negotiation and occupancy. The division also
specializes in innovative marketing programs tailored to client objectives for all types of investment grade and income-producing real estate. The divisions property marketing programs combine proven techniques with its detailed market
knowledge to create optimum results.  Auction and Conventional Sales 
The auction and conventional sales division provides innovative marketing and sales strategies for all types of commercial and residential
real estate, including single family homes, mixed-use developments, estate homes, multifamily dwellings, new home projects and conversions. Generally, the divisions auction sales business is countercyclical to the traditional sales real estate
market and has been a bellwether for us in forecasting market conditions.  Value Creation 
Our differentiated approach to investing is the cornerstone of how we create value for our shareholders. Our investment philosophy is based on
three core fundamentals:   


 

 
Leverage our global footprint and complementary investments and services businesses to identify attractive investment markets across the world. 
 


 

 
Selectively invest in opportunities across many real estate product types with a goal of maximizing cash flow and return on capital. 
 
  S-7 


Table of Contents



 

 
Actively manage assets and finance them conservatively to generate stable, predictable and growing cash flows for shareholders and clients. 
We are able to create value for our shareholders in the following ways: 
 


 

 
We have the ability to identify and acquire attractive real estate assets across many markets, in part due to the significant proprietary deal flow driven from an established global network of industry relationships,
particularly with financial institutions. This can create value by allowing us to maintain and develop a large pipeline of attractive opportunities.   


 

 
Our operating expertise allows us to focus on opportunistic investments where we can increase the value of assets and cash flows, such as in the case of distressed real estate owners or lenders seeking liquidity,
under-managed or under-leased assets or other repositioning opportunities.   


 

 
Many times, these investments are acquired at a discount to replacement cost or recent comparative sales, thereby offering opportunities to achieve above-average total returns. In many cases, we have the opportunity to
earn significant additional returns, such as through a promoted interest based on the performance of the assets.   


 

 
KW IMRES plays a critical role in supporting our investment strategy by providing local market intelligence and real-time data for evaluating investments, generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value
through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies.   


 

 
We understand that real estate is cyclical. Our management team employs a multi-cyclical approach that has resulted in our AUM being globally diversified across many sectors of real estate while maintaining a healthy
liquidity position and adequate access to capital.  Our Competitive Strengths 
We have a unique platform from which to execute our investment and services strategy. The combination of an investment platform and a service
business provides several competitive strengths when compared to other real estate buyers operating stand-alone or investment-focused firms and may allow us to generate superior risk-adjusted returns. Our investment strategy focuses on investments
that offer significant appreciation potential through intensive property management, leasing, repositioning, redevelopment and the opportunistic use of capital. We differentiate ourselves from other firms in the industry with our full service,
investment-oriented structure. Whereas most other firms use an investment platform to obtain additional service business revenue, we use our service platform to enhance the investment process and ensure the alignment of interests with our investors.
 The real estate business is cyclical. Real estate cycles are generally impacted by many factors, including the availability of equity and
debt capital, borrowing costs, rent levels and asset values. Our strategy has resulted in a strong track record of creating both asset and entity value for the benefit of our shareholders and partners over these various real estate cycles. Our
competitive advantages include:   


 

 
Transaction experience. Our executive committee has more than 125 years of combined real estate experience and has been working and investing together on average for over 15 years. Members of the executive
committee have collectively acquired, developed and managed in excess of $20 billion of real estate investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan throughout various economic cycles, both at our company and
throughout their careers.   


 

 
 Extensive relationship and sourcing network. We leverage our services business in order to source
off-market deals. In addition, the executive committee and our acquisition team have transacted 
 
  S-8 


Table of Contents



 
 
deals in nearly every major metropolitan market on the West Coast of the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan. Their local presence and reputation in
these markets have enabled them to cultivate key relationships with major holders of property inventory, in particularly financial institutions, throughout the real estate community. 
 


 

 
Structuring expertise and speed of execution. Prior acquisitions completed by us have taken a variety of forms, including direct property investments, joint ventures, exchanges involving stock or operating
partnership units, participating loans and investments in performing and non-performing mortgages at various capital stack positions with the objective of long-term ownership. We believe we have developed a reputation of being able to quickly
execute, as well as originate and creatively structure acquisitions, dispositions and financing transactions.   


 

 
Vertically integrated platform for operational enhancement. We have over 500 employees in both KW Investments and KW IMRES, with 25 regional offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland,
Spain, Jersey and Japan and manage and oversee over 5,000 operating associates. We have a hands-on approach to real estate investing and possess local expertise in property management, leasing, construction management, development and investment
sales, which we believe enable us to invest successfully in selected submarkets.

Risk protection and investment discipline. We underwrite our investments based upon a thorough examination of property economics and a critical understanding of market dynamics and risk-management strategies. We
conduct an in-depth sensitivity analysis on each of our acquisitions. This analysis applies various economic scenarios that include changes to rental rates, absorption periods, operating expenses, interest rates, exit values and holding periods. We
use this analysis to develop our disciplined acquisition strategies.  Recent Developments 
Subsequent Events  Subsequent to June
30, 2016, we acquired $81 million of real estate-related investments, including a 430-unit multifamily property in the Western United States. Our total equity investment in these transactions was approximately $19 million (including closing
costs). In addition, we and our equity partners disposed of $284 million of real estate-related investments, including two multifamily properties totaling 680 units in the Western United States, a commercial property in the Western United
States totaling 173,976 square feet, 18 residential units in the Western United States and three commercial properties in the United Kingdom totaling 112,107 square feet. 
Pipeline  As of August 3, 2016, we and
our equity partners are under separate contracts to purchase five multifamily properties in the Western United States, three commercial properties in the Western United States and one residential property in the Western United States at an aggregate
sales price of approximately $346 million. We anticipate financing these acquisitions with a combination of debt financing, balance sheet cash and partner equity. With respect to five of these assets with an aggregate sales price of
approximately $86 million, we have non-refundable deposits of approximately $6 million held in escrow. The amount of our equity investment in these acquisitions has not yet been determined, but we currently expect our aggregate equity
investment in these acquisitions to be between $45 million to $55 million. There can be no assurance that we will complete the potential acquisitions under contract. 
In addition, as of August 3, 2016, we and our equity partners are under separate contracts to dispose of one multifamily property in the
Western United States, a commercial property in the Western United States, three

residential properties in the Western United States, a loan asset secured by a property in the Western United States, a commercial property in the United Kingdom and a commercial property in
Spain at an aggregate sales price of approximately $143 million. We currently expect to receive a total of approximately $31.5 million in proceeds from these transactions. There can be no assurance that we will complete the
potential dispositions under contract.

  S-11 


Table of Contents



 

 
be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness; and 
 


 

 
be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. 
 


 
As of June 30, 2016, on a pro forma as adjusted basis after giving effect to the issuance and sale of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses to be paid by us, and the use of a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes to repay $60.0 million of the amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility: 
 


 

 
we and our subsidiaries that are guarantors had approximately $1,638.0 million of total senior indebtedness outstanding (excluding debt premium and discount), of which: 
 


 

 
$693.0 million was secured non-recourse mortgage indebtedness (excluding debt premium and discount); and   


 

 
$905.0 million was senior unsecured indebtedness, consisting of the notes we are offering hereby, $650.0 million of the initial notes and $55.0 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2042, which we refer to as the 2042
notes; and   


 

 
we had $40.0 million outstanding balances under our unsecured revolving credit facility and had $435.0 million of availability under this facility. 
 


 
In addition, as of such date, we and our subsidiary guarantors had $65.5 million aggregate principal amount of guarantees that we and our guarantors provided in connection with loans secured by consolidated assets and
assets held in various joint ventures that have recourse to us and our guarantors.   


 
 For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, the revenues of our non-guarantor subsidiaries
constituted approximately 73.4% and 78.0%, respectively, of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings consolidated revenues, and the operating income of our non-guarantor subsidiaries for these periods was approximately $88.3 million and $147.0 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total assets of those subsidiaries constituted approximately 77.6% of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings consolidated total assets, and those subsidiaries had $3,244.7 million of secured non-recourse mortgage
indebtedness (excluding debt premium and discount), of which none has recourse to us. However, these figures are as of June 30, 2016 and do not reflect transactions that we have entered into after that date, or

 
  S-12 


Table of Contents



 
 
future transactions that we may enter into. Depending on the particular terms of any acquisition or other transaction that one or more of our subsidiaries may enter into, those subsidiaries may
not be required by the terms of the indenture to guarantee the Notes. Accordingly, these figures may fluctuate from time to time, and these figures may increase or decrease materially in future periods. For example, the instruments governing our
acquisitions (such as the relevant loan agreement, or the terms of the relevant partnership agreement, limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the borrower, or any related joint venture agreement or the terms of
any relevant co-investment vehicle or separate account or investment program) may prohibit the relevant subsidiary from guaranteeing the Notes. In many such cases, the indenture does not require our subsidiaries, including those described above, to
guarantee the Notes. In addition, the indenture does not require certain non-material and non-wholly owned subsidiaries to guarantee the Notes.   


 Optional Redemption 
At any time prior to April 1, 2019, we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
redemption date, as described in this prospectus supplement.   


 
At any time and from time to time on or after April 1, 2019, we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices specified under the caption Description of the NotesOptional
Redemption, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.   


 
Prior to April 1, 2017, we may redeem up to 35% of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings.   


 
There is no sinking fund for the notes.   


 
See Description of the NotesOptional Redemption.   


 Fundamental Change 
Upon a fundamental change (as defined under Description of the NotesFundamental Change), we will be required to make an offer to purchase the notes. The purchase price will equal 101 % of the principal amount of the notes to be
repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). We may not have sufficient funds
available at the time of any fundamental change to make any required debt repayment (including repurchases of the notes). See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance
a fundamental change offer.

 No Listing; No Established Trading Market 
We do not intend to list the notes on any securities exchange or have them quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system. An active and liquid trading market for the notes may not develop. If an active or liquid trading market for the notes does
not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected.   


 Form and Denomination 
The notes will be initially issued in the form of one or more global securities, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, and deposited with the trustee for the notes as custodian for The
Depository Trust Company, or DTC, as depositary, and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. See Description of the NotesBook-Entry, Delivery and Form. 
 


 Use of Proceeds 
We estimate that the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes we are offering will be approximately $197.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
  


 
 We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes to repay $60.0 million of our
outstanding balance

under our unsecured revolving credit facility, and the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions, co-investments, capital expenditures and the repayment of
other outstanding indebtedness. See Description of Other Indebtedness and Use of Proceeds.

borrowers. Consolidated EBITDA is not a recognized term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and does not purport to be an alternative to net earnings as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating
activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, consolidated EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for managements discretionary use, as it does not remove all non-cash items (such as acquisition-related gains)
or consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Our presentation of consolidated EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a
substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our management believes consolidated EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of consolidated
EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Additionally,
we believe consolidated EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations. 


(4)
Adjusted EBITDA represents our consolidated EBITDA, as defined above, adjusted to exclude corporate merger and acquisition-related expenses, our share-based compensation expense and EBITDA attributable to
non-controlling interests. Our management uses adjusted EBITDA to analyze our business because it adjusts consolidated EBITDA for items we believe do not accurately reflect the nature of our business going forward or that relate to non-cash
compensation expense or non-controlling interests. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Additionally, we believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more
accurate picture of our results from operations. However, consolidated EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use consolidated EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in
addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of consolidated EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures of other companies. Furthermore, consolidated EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our managements discretionary use, as they do not remove all non-cash items (such as acquisition-related
gains) or consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for consolidated EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments,
which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain
restricted payments. 


(5)
Prior to 2014, our adjusted EBITDA metric was comparable to our current consolidated EBITDA metric as it was calculated as consolidated EBITDA, adjusted to solely exclude merger-related expenses and share-based
compensation expense. Beginning in 2014, as non-controlling interests became more significant on our consolidated balance sheet primarily due to the consolidation of KWEs results on our financial statements, we determined that it was
appropriate to supplement consolidated EBITDA with a new or revised metric. 


(6)
The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated by dividing earnings by fixed charges. For this purpose, earnings consists of pretax income from continuing operations before non-controlling interest and
our equity in income of joint ventures plus fixed charges and operating distributions from equity investees, and fixed charges consists of interest expense, whether capitalized or expensed, amortization related to indebtedness and
premiums or discounts of stock issuances and an estimate of interest expense within rental expense.

RISK FACTORS 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the term notes refers to the notes we are offering pursuant to this
prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. Kennedy-Wilson is the primary obligor under the notes, the initial notes and the 2042 notes, and the guarantors described in this prospectus supplement are guarantors of the initial notes and
the 2042 notes and will be the initial guarantors of the notes. In this section of this prospectus supplement, the words we, us, our and Kennedy-Wilson refer to Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. and not to any of
its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.  Any investment in the notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully
consider the risks described below and all of the information contained or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus before deciding whether to purchase the notes, including the risks under the heading
Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and under the heading Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, as well as the other
reports we file from time to time with the SEC that are incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement. The risks and uncertainties described below and in the incorporated documents are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations would
suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in
this prospectus supplement. In addition to the risk factors incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement, you should consider the additional risk factors below: 
Risks Related to the Notes  Ratings of
the notes may affect the market price and marketability of the notes.  The ratings of the initial notes are limited in scope and do
not address all material risks relating to an investment in the notes, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. Securities rated below investment grade are generally subject to a higher risk of payment
default and price volatility than similar, high-rated securities. Furthermore, increases in leverage or deteriorating outlooks for an issue, or volatile markets, could lead to continued significant deterioration in market prices of securities rated
below investment grade.  Ratings only reflect the views of the issuing rating agency or agencies, and ratings could at any time be revised
downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency. Furthermore, a rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any particular security, including the notes. In addition, ratings do not reflect market prices or
the suitability of a security for a particular investor, and any rating of the notes may not reflect all risks related to us and our business or the structure or market value of the notes. An explanation of the significance of ratings may be
obtained from the applicable rating agency.  A credit rating may not be issued and may not remain in effect for any given period of time,
and the applicable rating agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely any rating that it has issued if, in that rating agencys judgment, the circumstances so warrant. It is also possible that any rating assigned to the notes may be lowered
in connection with the application of the proceeds of this offering or in connection with future events, such as future acquisitions. Holders of the notes will have no recourse against us or any other parties in the event of the issuance of a
lower-than-expected rating or a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such a rating. Any lower-than-expected rating, and any lowering, suspension or withdrawal of an issued rating, may adversely affect the market price or marketability of the
notes.

Table of Contents
Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our
obligations under the notes.  As of June 30, 2016, on a pro forma as adjusted basis after giving effect to the issuance and sale of
$200 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses to be paid by us, and the use of a portion of the proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes to
repay $60.0 million of the amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, Kennedy-Wilson and its subsidiaries that are guarantors had approximately $1,638.0 million of outstanding indebtedness (excluding debt premium and
discount), of which $693.0 million was secured non-recourse mortgage indebtedness and $905.0 million was unsecured senior indebtedness, consisting of the notes we are offering, $650.0 million of the initial notes and $55.0 million of the 2042
notes. In addition, as of such date, we and the subsidiary guarantors had $65.5 million aggregate principal amount of guarantees that we and our subsidiary guarantors provided in connection with loans secured by consolidated assets and assets held
in various joint ventures that have recourse to us. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries had $3,244.7 million of secured, non-recourse mortgage indebtedness (excluding debt premium and discount) as of June 30, 2016, and the notes we hereby are offering
are structurally subordinated to such indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for you including:   


 

 
it may limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements; 
 


 

 
it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;   


 

 
we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;   


 

 
it may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy;   


 

 
the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness, including the notes; 
 


 

 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes; and 
 


 

 
our business and financial condition would materially and adversely suffer if we were unable to service our indebtedness, including the notes, or obtain additional financing, as needed. 
In addition, the indenture governing the notes and the initial notes, the indenture governing the 2042 notes and our unsecured revolving
credit facility contain financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured
or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.  Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may still incur significantly more debt,
which could exacerbate the risks described above.  The indenture governing the notes and the initial notes, the indenture governing
the 2042 notes and our unsecured revolving credit facility permit us and our subsidiaries to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. As of June 30, 2016, on a pro forma as adjusted basis after giving effect to the issuance and sale
of the notes we are offering and the expected use of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes, we had $40.0 of consolidated indebtedness and $435.0 million of availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility. 
  S-21 


Table of Contents
We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a fundamental change offer. 
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indentures governing the notes, the initial notes and the 2042 notes), which
includes a change of control event or delisting of our common stock, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of the notes, the initial notes and the 2042 notes. We may have insufficient funds available to make any required repurchases of the
notes, the initial notes or the 2042 notes upon a fundamental change. In addition, our unsecured revolving credit facility provides that the occurrence of a change of control constitutes a default. Our failure to purchase tendered notes, initial
notes and 2042 notes would constitute a default under the relevant indenture governing the same, which, in turn, would constitute a default under our credit facility. See Description of the NotesFundamental Change. 
In the event of a change of control or termination of trading of our common stock, our Series B preferred stock will be redeemable at the option of the
stockholders thereof.  Under the indentures governing the notes, the initial notes and the 2042 notes, upon the occurrence of a
fundamental change (as defined in those indentures), which includes a change of control event or a delisting of our common stock, each noteholder will have the right to require us to purchase that noteholders notes, initial notes or 2042 notes
at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date. The occurrence of a fundamental change will also trigger a redemption right held by the holders of our Series B preferred
stock under the certificate of designation establishing the terms of such preferred stock. Under the terms of these indentures, Kennedy-Wilson may not make any restricted payment to facilitate a redemption of the Series B preferred stock unless
Kennedy-Wilson has restricted payment capacity or has previously made an offer to noteholders to purchase their notes. If the noteholders, however, fail for any reason to tender all of their notes under the offer to purchase them, and our preferred
stockholders accept the offer to purchase the Series B preferred stock, we will be required to use cash to fund the purchase of our Series B preferred stock. In the event this occurs, it may be more difficult for us to make scheduled payments on the
untendered notes. See Description of the NotesFundamental Change. In addition, we may not redeem the Series B preferred stock without the consent of the lenders under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Our failure to purchase
the Series B preferred stock when required could give the holders of that stock a legal claim against us.  A subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it
constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy or similar state law, which would prevent the holders of the notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims. 
Under U.S. bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a subsidiary guarantee can be voided, or claims under
the subsidiary guarantee may be subordinated to all other debts of that subsidiary guarantor, if, among other things, the subsidiary guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its subsidiary guarantee or, in some states, when
payments become due under the subsidiary guarantee, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of the subsidiary guarantee and:   


 

 
was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;   


 

 
was engaged in a business or transaction for which the subsidiary guarantors remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or 
 


 

 
intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature. 
A subsidiary guarantee may also be voided, without regard to the above factors, if a court finds that the subsidiary guarantor entered into
the subsidiary guarantee with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors. 
  S-22 


Table of Contents
A court would likely find that a subsidiary guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration for its subsidiary guarantee if the subsidiary guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes. If a court were to void a subsidiary guarantee, you would no longer have a claim
against the subsidiary guarantor. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from
the subsidiary guarantor.  The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending on the governing law.
Generally, a subsidiary guarantor would be considered insolvent if:   


 

 
the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;   


 

 
the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they became absolute and mature; or
  


 

 
it could not pay its debts as they became due.  Each subsidiary guarantee will contain a
provision intended to limit the subsidiary guarantors liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of its obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be
effective to protect the subsidiary guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law.  The notes will not be guaranteed by all of our
subsidiaries.  The notes will not be guaranteed by a number of our subsidiaries. To the extent that any of our subsidiaries do not
guarantee the notes, the notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations, including indebtedness, of those non-guarantor subsidiaries. The claims of creditors of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade
creditors, will have priority as to the assets of those subsidiaries. As a result, if we default on our obligations under the notes, you will not have any claims against any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. For the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the revenues of our non-guarantor subsidiaries constituted approximately 73.4% and 78.0%, respectively, of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings consolidated revenues, and the operating income of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries for those periods was approximately $88.3 million and $147.0 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total assets of those subsidiaries constituted approximately 77.6% of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings consolidated
total assets, and those subsidiaries had $3,244.7 million of secured non-recourse mortgage indebtedness (excluding debt premium and discount), of which none has recourse to us. However, these figures are as of June 30, 2016 and do not reflect
transactions that we have entered into after that date or future transactions that we may enter into. Depending on the particular terms of any acquisition or other transaction that one or more of our subsidiaries may enter into, those subsidiaries
may not be required by the terms of the indenture governing the notes to guarantee the notes. Accordingly, these figures may fluctuate from time to time, and these figures may increase or decrease materially in future periods. For example, the
instruments governing our acquisitions (such as the relevant loan agreement, or the terms of the relevant partnership agreement, limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the borrower, or any related joint venture
agreement or the terms of any relevant co-investment vehicle or separate account or investment program) may prohibit the relevant subsidiary from guaranteeing the notes. In many such cases, the indenture does not require our subsidiaries, including
those described above, to guarantee the notes. In addition, the Indenture does not require, subject to limitation, certain non-material and non-wholly owned subsidiaries to guarantee the notes. 
  S-23 


Table of Contents
We may not have access to the cash flow and other assets of our subsidiaries and our joint ventures that may
be needed to make payment on the notes.  Although our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, our
subsidiaries and joint ventures are not obligated to make funds available to us for payment on the notes. Accordingly, our ability to make payments on the notes depends on the earnings of, and the distribution of funds from, our subsidiaries and
joint ventures. Furthermore, our subsidiaries will be permitted under the terms of the indentures governing the notes, the initial notes and the 2042 notes, our unsecured revolving credit facility and the instruments governing other indebtedness to
incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by those subsidiaries to us. The agreements governing the future indebtedness of our subsidiaries may
not permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on the notes when due. See Description of Other Indebtedness. 
To service our indebtedness, including the notes, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that
are beyond our control.  Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, and to fund planned
capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. 
However, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, current capital spending projects may require significant
additional funds to complete or be successful and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we consummate an acquisition,
our debt service requirements could increase. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes, on or before maturity. We may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our unsecured revolving credit
facility, the notes, the initial notes and the 2042 notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  An active trading market for the notes may not
develop.  Prior to this offering, there was no public market for the notes. We have been informed by certain of the underwriters that
they intend to make a market in the notes after this offering is completed. However, the underwriters may cease their market-making activities at any time. In addition, the liquidity of the trading market in the notes and the market price quoted for
the notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for high yield securities and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the financial performance or prospects of companies in our industry generally. As a result,
an active trading market may not develop or be maintained for the notes. If an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the market price of the notes may decline and the liquidity of the notes may be limited. 
Our debt agreements will contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business. 
The indenture governing the notes and the initial notes, the indenture governing the 2042 notes and the agreement governing our unsecured
revolving credit facility contains, various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit Kennedy-Wilsons and its restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things: 
 


 

 
incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;   


 

 
pay dividends or distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock;   


 

 
make investments;


 
enter into sale/leaseback transactions;   


 

 
enter into transactions with affiliates; and   


 

 
enter into mergers or consolidations.  Additionally, the agreement governing our unsecured
revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes and the initial notes, the indenture governing the 2042 notes and the
agreement governing our unsecured revolving credit facility. We may also be unable to take advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness. See
Description of Other Indebtedness.  Many of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture will not apply if the notes are rated
investment grade by Moodys and S&P and no event of default has occurred and is continuing.  Many of the covenants in the
indenture governing the notes will not apply if the notes are rated investment grade (as defined in the indenture) by Moodys and S&P, provided that at such time no event of default with respect to the notes has occurred and is continuing.
There can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade or, if they are rated investment grade, that the notes will maintain such ratings. Termination of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that
would not be permitted while these covenants were in force. See Description of the NotesCertain Covenants.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
Statements included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus or in other reports and
statements released by us that are not historical facts constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21 of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking
statements are estimates reflecting the judgment of our senior management based on estimates, expectations, forecasts and projections that are current as of the date of the applicable forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements include
comments that express opinions about trends and factors that may impact future operating results. Disclosures that use words such as believe, anticipate, estimate, intend, could,
plan, expect, project or the negative of these, as well as similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of any of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement
is not forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, rely on a number of assumptions concerning
future events, many of which are outside of our control, and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or achievements or industry results to differ materially from any future results, performance
or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the
time the statements were made, the transactions and events described may not happen as described or may not happen at all. In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider the risks described and referred to under the heading
Risk Factors on page S-20 of this prospectus supplement, including, but not limited to, the following factors:   


 

 
disruptions in general economic and business conditions, particularly in geographies where our business may be concentrated;   


 

 
volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, higher interest rates, higher loan costs, less desirable loan terms and a reduction in the availability of mortgage loans, all of which could increase costs
and could limit our ability to acquire additional real estate assets;   


 

 
continued high levels of, or increases in, unemployment and general slowdowns in commercial activity;   


 

 
our leverage and ability to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness;   


 

 
an increase in our debt service obligations;   


 

 
our ability to generate a sufficient amount of cash to satisfy working capital requirements and to service our existing and future indebtedness; 
 


 

 
our ability to achieve improvements in operating efficiency;   


 

 
foreign currency fluctuations;   


 

 
adverse changes in the securities markets;   


 

 
our ability to retain our senior management and attract and retain qualified and experienced employees;   


 

 
our ability to retain major clients and renew related contracts;   


 

 
trends in use of large, full-service commercial real estate providers; 
  S-26 


Table of Contents


 

 
changes in tax laws in the United States, Ireland, United Kingdom, Spain or Japan that reduce or eliminate deductions or other tax benefits we receive; 
 


 

 
future acquisitions may not be available at favorable prices or upon advantageous terms and conditions; and   


 

 
costs relating to the acquisition of assets we may acquire could be higher than anticipated. 
Each forward-looking statement should be considered in the context of the various disclosures we make about our business, including, without
limitation, the factors discussed above. Except as required by law, we do not intend or have an obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.

USE OF PROCEEDS 
We estimate that the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes will be approximately $197.0 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes to repay $60.0 million of the outstanding balance under our unsecured
revolving credit facility, and the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions, co-investments, capital expenditures and the repayment of other outstanding indebtedness. 
Loans under our unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) plus 2.50% or 3.00%, depending on the consolidated leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date, and have a maturity date of December 10, 2018. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, the rate at which interest
accrues on the loans is LIBOR plus 2.50%. Subject to certain conditions precedent and at our option, the maturity date of the facility may be extended by one year.

DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility 
We have a $475.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent
and letter of credit issuer. The borrower under the unsecured revolving credit facility is Kennedy-Wilson, Inc., and the guarantors are Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and the subsidiaries of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. that are guarantors
under the notes, the initial notes and the 2042 notes.  Loans under the revolving facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
LIBOR plus 2.50% or 3.00%, depending on the consolidated leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date, and have a maturity date of December 10, 2018. Subject to certain conditions precedent and at our request, the maturity date of the
revolving facility may be extended by one year.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the average outstanding borrowings under the
unsecured revolving credit facility were $56.0 million. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, the principal amount outstanding under this unsecured revolving credit facility was $100.0 million, and $0 million of accrued and unpaid
interest was outstanding. We currently intend to use a portion of the proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes to repay $60.0 million of the outstanding balance under this facility. 
The unsecured revolving credit facility contains customary financial, affirmative and negative covenants. The financial covenants under the
revolving credit facility require us to maintain:   


 

 
a maximum consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not greater than 65%, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter; 
 


 

 
a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than 1.60 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the period of four full fiscal quarters then ended;
  


 

 
a minimum consolidated tangible net worth equal to or greater than the sum of $920,660,504.65 plus an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of net equity proceeds we receive after September 30, 2015, measured as of the
last day of each fiscal quarter;   


 

 
a maximum recourse leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not greater than an amount equal to consolidated tangible net worth as of the measurement date multiplied by 1.5, measured as of the last day of
each fiscal quarter;   


 

 
a maximum adjusted secured leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not greater than 55%, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter; and 
 


 

 
liquidity (as defined in the credit agreement) of at least $250 million.  In addition to
customary reporting and compliance requirements, the principal negative and affirmative covenants under the revolving credit facility require us, among other things:   


 

 
not to incur indebtedness, other than those permitted by the revolving credit facility;   


 

 
not to permit any incurrence of liens, other than those permitted by the revolving credit facility; 
  S-30 


Table of Contents


 

 
not to make or allow certain investments unless certain conditions set forth in the revolving credit facility are satisfied;   


 

 
not to enter into a merger, consolidation, reorganization or recapitalization or to reincorporate in a different jurisdiction, liquidate or sell substantially all of our assets; 
 


 

 
not to engage in transactions with affiliates, other than those permitted by the revolving credit facility;   


 

 
to maintain insurance policies with certain minimum coverage; and   


 

 
not to make a change in the principal nature of our business;  The credit agreement also
provides that we must cause each of our subsidiaries that becomes a guarantor of the notes and the initial notes to become a guarantor under this credit facility. 
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with such covenants. We pay customary fees to the administrative agent and the revolving lenders
under our unsecured revolving credit facility.  7.75% Senior Notes due 2042 
In November 2012, we completed a public offering of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of Kennedy-Wilsons 7.75% Senior Notes due
2042 (the 2042 notes). In December 2012, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2042 notes from us. The 2042 notes will mature on December 1, 2042 and bear interest at
a rate of 7.75% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2013. 
The 2042 notes are Kennedy-Wilsons unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of Kennedy-Wilsons
existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and the same subsidiaries that guarantee the initial notes and that will guarantee the notes offered
hereby. The 2042 notes contain substantially similar restrictive covenants as those contained in the indenture governing the notes and initial notes, including, among others, limitations on Kennedy-Wilsons ability and the ability of certain of
its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pay dividends or make any other distributions from restricted subsidiaries, redeem or repurchase capital stock, sell assets or subsidiary stock, engage in
transactions with affiliates, create or permit liens on assets, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and enter into consolidations or mergers. 
At any time prior to December 1, 2017, Kennedy-Wilson may redeem the 2042 notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of
their principal amount, plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. At any time and from time to time on or after December 1, 2017, Kennedy-Wilson may redeem the 2042 notes, in
whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. 
5.875% Senior Notes due 2024  On March
25, 2014, we issued $300.0 million principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024, and on November 18, 2014, we issued an additional $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024, which we refer to collectively in this
prospectus supplement as the initial notes. The terms of the initial notes are substantially identical to the terms of the notes we are offering and are described in this prospectus supplement under the caption Description of the
Notes.

Other Consolidated Debt 
In addition to the indebtedness described above, we also carry non-recourse, asset-level indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet. As of
June 30, 2016, the outstanding principal amount under these loans was $3,937.7 million (excluding debt discount), with a weighted average interest rate of 3.58% and a weighted average remaining maturity of 6.4 years. As of June 30, 2016, $693.0
million (excluding debt discount) of this indebtedness was indebtedness of our guarantor subsidiaries and $3,244.7 million (excluding debt premium and discount) was indebtedness of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

DESCRIPTION OF OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  In 2010, we entered into a Convertible Series B
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Series B Purchase Agreement) with Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (Fairfax), for the issuance and sale in a private placement of 32,550 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (the Series B Preferred Stock), at a purchase price of $1,000 per share or a total purchase price of $32,550,000. The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock. In
accordance with the terms of the Series B Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the Series B Registration Rights Agreement) and Shareholders Agreement with Fairfax. Under the Series B Registration
Rights Agreement, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have certain demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock and the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred
Stock. Under the Shareholders Agreement, certain of our stockholders have agreed to vote all of the shares of voting stock held by such stockholders in favor of Fairfaxs designee to our Board of Directors. We also agreed to nominate
Fairfaxs designee as a member of the Board of Directors.  The Series B Preferred Stock has the rights, privileges, preferences and
restrictions set forth in the Certificate of Designation (the Series B Certificate of Designation) we filed with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware. Under the Series B Certificate of Designation, prior to November 3, 2018,
each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder at any time, into shares of our common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate. As of June 30, 2016, the conversion rate of the Series B Preferred Stock was
approximately 101.3 shares of our common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock, and is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances (as adjusted, the Series B Conversion Rate). At any time on or after May 3, 2017 and prior to
November 3, 2018, we have the option to convert all or part of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock at the then-applicable Series B Conversion Rate. On November 3, 2018, each outstanding share of Series
B Preferred Stock will automatically be converted into shares of our common stock at the then-applicable Series B Conversion Rate. Cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock accrue at an annual rate of $64.52 per share. The dividends are
payable quarterly in arrears. Subject to limited exceptions, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will have no voting rights. The Series B Certificate of Designation contains customary anti-dilution protection. 
Under the Series B Certificate of Designation, upon a change of control of or a delisting of our common stock (as such terms are defined in
the Series B Certificate of Designation), a fundamental change will have deemed to have occurred. In the event a fundamental change occurs, we must offer to purchase all of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the change of
control or delisting of our common stock at a purchase price per share equal to $1,150 plus all accumulated and accrued dividends to the effective date of such fundamental change. On August 5, 2016, in connection with this offering of notes, Fairfax
waived the requirement set forth in the Series B Certificate of Designation that provides that the offer to purchase upon a fundamental change be made at least 20 business days prior to the effective date (as such term is defined in the Series B
Certificate of Designation) of the fundamental change. Instead, we are required to complete such an offer within 90 days following completion of the fundamental change offer made to holders of the notes. 
Any Series B Preferred Stock converted after a fundamental change will automatically receive a number of shares of our common stock as
provided for in the Series B Certificate of Designation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES 
In this description, the words we, us, our and Issuer refer to Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. and not to
any of its subsidiaries. Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading Certain Definitions. 
On March 25, 2014 (the Original Issue Date), we issued $300.0 million principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due
2024 (the Original Notes) under an indenture (the Base Indenture), dated as of March 25, 2014, between us and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the
Trustee), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture thereto (the Supplemental Indenture, and, together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture), dated as of March 25,
2014, among us, the Trustee and the initial Guarantors. On November 18, 2014 (the Additional Issue Date), we issued an additional $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 (such Notes,
together with the Original Notes, the Initial Notes). The Notes offered hereby will be issued as Additional Notes under the Indenture and will be treated as a single series with the Initial Notes. Holders of the Notes
offered hereby and the Initial Notes will vote as one class under the Indenture.  The following description of the particular terms of the
Notes and the Guarantees supplements and, to the extent inconsistent therewith, replaces the description of the general terms and provisions of the debt securities and the guarantees set forth in the accompanying prospectus, to which reference is
hereby made. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the Trust Indenture Act). The following description is only a
summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, not this description, defines your rights as holders of these Notes. You may request copies of the Indenture at our address set forth under the
heading Where You Can Find More Information.  Brief Description of the Notes 
These Notes:   


 

 
are unsecured senior obligations of the Issuer;   


 

 
are senior in right of payment to all existing and any future Subordinated Obligations of the Issuer; and   


 

 
will be guaranteed by Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. (Parent) and each Subsidiary Guarantor on a senior basis. 
Principal, Maturity and Interest  On the
Original Issue Date, the Issuer issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. On the Additional Issue Date, the Issuer issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Issuer issued the Initial Notes, and will issue
the Notes offered hereby, in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will mature on April 1, 2024. Subject to our compliance with the covenant described under the subheading Certain
CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness, we are permitted to issue more notes under the Indenture in an unlimited aggregate principal amount (the Additional Notes), provided that if the Additional Notes are not
fungible with the Notes for United States federal income tax purposes, the Additional Notes will have a separate CUSIP number. The Notes offered hereby will constitute Additional Notes for the purposes of the Indenture. The Initial Notes offered
under the Indenture on the Original Issue Date and the Additional Issue Date, the Additional Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single series of Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Holders of

the Initial Notes, the Additional Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will vote as one class under the Indenture. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this Description of the Notes, references to the Notes include any Additional Notes actually issued, including the Additional Notes offered hereby. 
Interest on these Notes offered hereby will accrue at the rate of 5.875% per annum from, and including, April 1, 2016 and will be payable
semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on October 1, 2016. We will make each interest payment to the holders of record of these Notes on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15,
respectively.  Interest on these Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date
it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.  Optional Redemption 
Except as set forth below, we will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at our option. 
On and after April 1, 2019, we will be entitled at our option to redeem all or a portion of these Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60
days notice, at the redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount on the redemption date), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on April 1 of the years set forth below:

 In addition, before April 1, 2017, we will be entitled at our option on one or more occasions to redeem Notes
(which includes Additional Notes, if any) in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (which includes Additional Notes, if any) originally issued at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage
of principal amount) of 105.875%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings (provided that if the Equity Offering is an
offering by Parent, a portion of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof equal to the amount required to redeem any such Notes is contributed to the equity capital of the Issuer), provided that: 
(1) at least 65% of such aggregate principal amount of Notes (which includes Additional Notes, if any) remains outstanding immediately after
the occurrence of each such redemption (other than Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Issuer or its Affiliates); and  (2) each
such redemption occurs within 90 days after the date of the related Equity Offering.  Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering
may be given prior to the completion thereof, and any such redemption or notice, may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to the completion of the related Equity Offering. 
Prior to April 1, 2019, we will be entitled, at our option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and 
  S-35

accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Notice of
such redemption must be delivered electronically if held at DTC or mailed by first-class mail to each holders registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. 
Applicable Premium means with respect to a Note at any redemption date, as provided by the Issuer, the greater of
(1) 1.00% of the principal amount of such Note on such redemption date and (2) the excess of (A) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Note on April 1, 2019 (such redemption price being described in the second
paragraph in this Optional Redemption section, exclusive of any accrued and unpaid interest) plus (ii) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Note through April 1, 2019 (but excluding accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Adjusted Treasury Rate, over (B) the principal amount of such Note on such redemption date. 
Adjusted Treasury Rate means, with respect to any redemption date and as provided by the Issuer, (1) the yield,
under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated H. 15(519) or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities, for the maturity corresponding to the
Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after April 1, 2019, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate
shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain
such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date, in each case
calculated on the third Business Day immediately preceding the date that the applicable redemption notice is first mailed or delivered electronically if held at DTC, in each case, plus 0.50%. 
Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a
maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes from the redemption date to April 1, 2019, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt
securities of a maturity most nearly equal to April 1, 2019.  Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to
any redemption date, if clause (2) of the Adjusted Treasury Rate definition is applicable, the average of three, or such lesser number as is obtained by the Issuer, Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date. 
Quotation Agent means the Reference Treasury Dealer selected by the Issuer. 
Reference Treasury Dealer means each of (i) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. and (ii) a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States selected by U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., and in each case the respective successors and assigns of the foregoing. 
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date,
the average, as determined by the Issuer, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Issuer by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding date that the applicable redemption notice is first mailed or delivered electronically if held at DTC.

Table of Contents
Selection and Notice of Redemption 
If we are redeeming less than all the Notes at any time, the Trustee will select Notes on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method in
accordance with the procedures of DTC.  We will redeem Notes with principal amounts of $2,000 or less in whole and not in part. We will
cause notices of redemption to be delivered electronically if held at DTC or mailed by first-class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. 
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed. We will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.  No Sinking Fund;
Open Market Purchases  We are not required to make any sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain
circumstances, we may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the captions Fundamental Change and Certain CovenantsLimitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock. We may at any time and
from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.  Guaranties 
Parent and each Subsidiary Guarantor of the Issuer will jointly and severally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, our obligations under
the Indenture and the Notes. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty are designed to be limited as necessary to prevent such Subsidiary Guaranty from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and,
therefore, will be expressly limited to the maximum amount that such Subsidiary Guaranty could guarantee without such Subsidiary Guaranty constituting a fraudulent conveyance. This limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Subsidiary
Guaranty from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesA subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy or similar state law, which would
prevent the holders of the notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims.  If a Subsidiary Guaranty were rendered
voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Subsidiary Guarantors
liability on its Subsidiary Guaranty could be reduced to zero. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesA subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy or similar state law,
which would prevent the holders of the notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims.  The Subsidiary Guaranty of a
Subsidiary Guarantor will be deemed to be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, without the need of any action on the part of such Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee or otherwise: 
(1) upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any transaction pursuant to which such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Issuer);  (2) upon the
sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor;  (3) upon the designation of such Subsidiary
Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Non-Material Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of the Indenture; 
  S-37

(4) upon a legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided under
Defeasance and Satisfaction and Discharge; or  (5) as described under Amendments and Waivers, 
in the case of clause (1) or (2), other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and as permitted by the Indenture. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, the Notes or the Guaranties, if the Issuer, due to an error made in good faith,
causes any Person to execute the Supplemental Indenture or any other supplement to the Base Indenture, or any other instrument, purporting to cause such Person to guarantee the Notes and become a Subsidiary Guarantor and, at the time of such
execution, such Person is not a domestic Subsidiary of the Issuer, then, notwithstanding such Supplemental Indenture or other supplement or instrument, the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Person shall automatically, and without the need for any action
on the part of the Issuer, such Person or the Trustee or otherwise, be null and void, with the same force and effect as if such execution had never occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuer and such Person may
nonetheless thereafter execute and deliver to the Trustee such instruments or other documents that shall memorialize the nullification of such Subsidiary Guaranty. 
Not all of our Subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. Also, the joint venture and fund entities in which we have investments and their
respective subsidiaries (which are not Subsidiaries of the Issuer as of the date of the Indenture) are not guarantors and are not subject to any of the obligations and covenants described hereunder. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us. For the six months ended June
30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, the revenues of our non-guarantor subsidiaries constituted approximately 73.4% and 78.0%, respectively, of Parents consolidated revenues, and the operating income of our non-guarantor subsidiaries for
those periods was approximately $88.3 million and $147.0 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total assets of those subsidiaries constituted approximately 77.6% of Parents consolidated total assets, and those subsidiaries
had $3,244.7 million of secured non-recourse mortgage indebtedness (excluding debt premium and discount), of which none has recourse to us. However, these figures are as of June 30, 2016 and do not reflect transactions that we have entered into
after that date or future transactions that we may enter into. Depending on the particular terms of any acquisition or other transaction that one or more of our subsidiaries may enter into, those subsidiaries may not be required by the terms of the
Indenture to guarantee the Notes. Accordingly, these figures may fluctuate from time to time, and these figures may increase or decrease materially in future periods. For example, the instruments governing our acquisitions (such as the relevant loan
agreement, or the terms of the relevant partnership agreement, limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the borrower, or any related joint venture agreement or the terms of any relevant Co-investment Vehicle or
separate account or investment program) may prohibit the relevant subsidiary from guaranteeing the Notes. In many such cases, the Indenture does not require our subsidiaries, including those described above, to guarantee the Notes. 
Ranking  The indebtedness evidenced by
the Notes and the Guaranties will be senior unsecured obligations and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all other unsecured Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be. 
As of June 30, 2016, on a pro forma as adjusted basis, after giving effect to the issuance and sale of $200 million aggregate principal amount
of the Notes offered hereby, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses to be paid by the Issuer, and the use of a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes to repay $60.0 million
of the amounts outstanding under the 
  S-38 


Table of Contents

Issuers Credit Agreement, the Issuers and the Guarantors Senior Indebtedness was approximately $1,638.0 million, of which: 
(a) $693.0 million (excluding debt premium and discount) was secured Non-Recourse Indebtedness under mortgage loans; 
(b) $905.0 million was unsecured Senior Indebtedness, consisting of the Notes offered hereby, $650.0 million of the Initial Notes and $55.0
million of the Issuers 7.75% Senior Notes due 2042; and  (c) the Issuer had Indebtedness of $40.0 million outstanding under the
Credit Agreement and had $435.0 million of availability thereunder.  In addition, as of such date, the Issuer and the Subsidiary
Guarantors would have had $65.5 million aggregate principal amount of Guarantees that the Issuer and the Guarantors provided in connection with loans secured by consolidated assets and assets held in various joint ventures and that are recourse to
the Issuer and the Guarantors.  The Notes and the Guaranties are unsecured obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may
be. Secured debt and other secured obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors will be effectively senior to the Notes and the Guaranties to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt or other obligations. In addition, all
Indebtedness and trade payables of non-guarantor Subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes and the Guaranties.  Not all of our
subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesThe notes will not be guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries. 
Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, subject to the limitations set forth in the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Liens, such Indebtedness may be
secured Indebtedness. See Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness and Limitation on Liens.  Fundamental
Change  Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, each noteholder shall have the right to require that the Issuer purchase such
noteholders Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).  Within 30 days following any Fundamental Change, unless we
have exercised our option to redeem all the Notes as described under Optional Redemption, we will mail (or deliver electronically, if held at DTC) a notice to each noteholder with a copy to the Trustee (the Fundamental
Change Offer) stating:  (1) that a Fundamental Change has occurred and that such noteholder has the right to require us to
purchase such noteholders Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of noteholders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date);  (2) the circumstances and relevant facts
regarding such Fundamental Change (including information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and capitalization, in each case after giving effect to such Fundamental Change); 
  S-39 


Table of Contents
(3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed); and  (4) the instructions, as determined by us, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a
noteholder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased.  We will not be required to make a Fundamental Change Offer following a
Fundamental Change if a third party makes the Fundamental Change Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Fundamental Change Offer made by us and purchases all
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Fundamental Change Offer or if we have exercised our option to redeem all the Notes pursuant to the provisions described under Optional Redemption. 
We will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or
regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes as a result of a Fundamental Change. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the covenant described hereunder, we will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the covenant described hereunder by virtue of our compliance with such securities laws or regulations. 
The Fundamental Change purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the
Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Fundamental Change purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the underwriters of the Notes. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a
Change of Control and we do not foresee the occurrence of a Termination of Trading, although it is possible that, in the future, we could decide to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control or a Termination of Trading occurs. Subject to
the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture or result in a Termination
of Trading, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants
described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness, and Limitation on Liens, which limitations may terminate as described under Defeasance and Satisfaction and Discharge below.
Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenant, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or
provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.  Holders may not be entitled to
require us to purchase their Notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of our Board of Directors, including in connection with a proxy contest where our Board of Directors does not approve a dissident slate of
directors but approves them as continuing directors, even if our Board of Directors initially opposed the directors.  The Credit Agreement
provides that the occurrence of certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder. Future indebtedness that we may incur may contain prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would
constitute a Fundamental Change or require the purchase of such indebtedness upon a Fundamental Change. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require us to purchase the Notes could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if
the Fundamental Change itself does not, due to the financial effect of such purchase on us. Our ability to pay cash to the holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Fundamental Change may be limited by our then existing financial resources.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required purchases. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a
fundamental change offer. 
  S-40 


Table of Contents
The occurrence of a Fundamental Change will also trigger a redemption right held by the holders
of Parents Series B Preferred Stock under the certificate of designation establishing the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock. Pursuant to paragraph (a) and clause (11) of paragraph (b) under the covenant described under Certain
CovenantsLimitation on Restricted Payments, we may not make any Restricted Payment to redeem or repurchase Parents Series B Preferred Stock, unless we have sufficient restricted payment capacity or we have previously made an offer
to noteholders to repurchase the Notes. If the noteholders, however, reject our Fundamental Change Offer or fail for any reason to tender all of their Notes, and the stockholders of Parents Series B Preferred Stock accept Parents offer
to repurchase such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, we may have to pay dividends or make other payments to Parent so that it can use cash to fund the repurchase or redemption of its Series B Preferred Stock. In the event this occurs, it may be
more difficult for us to make scheduled payments on the untendered Notes. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesIn the event of a change of control or termination of trading of our common stock, our Series B preferred stock
will be redeemable at the option of the stockholders thereof.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Fundamental Change
Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of such Fundamental Change Offer. 
The phrase all or substantially all, as used with respect to the assets of the Issuer in the definition of Change of
Control, is subject to interpretation under applicable state law, and its applicability in a given instance would depend upon the facts and circumstances. As a result, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a sale or
transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer has occurred in a particular instance, in which case a holders ability to obtain the benefit of these provisions could be unclear. 
The provisions under the Indenture relative to our obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Fundamental Change may
be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.  For purposes of this
discussion of a repurchase of the Notes following a Fundamental Change Change of Control means the occurrence of any of the following: 
(1) any person or group (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), is or becomes the
beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 35% (or, in the case of any Permitted Holder, 50%) of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Parent; 
(2) individuals who on the Original Issue Date constituted the Board of Directors (together with any new directors whose election by such
Board of Directors or whose nomination for election by the shareholders of the Parent was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors of the Parent then still in office who were either directors on the Original Issue Date or whose election or
nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of Parent then in office; 
(3) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Parent; 
(4) the merger or consolidation of the Parent with or into another Person or the merger of another Person with or into the Parent, or the sale
of all or substantially all the consolidated assets of Parent (but in any event, upon the sale of more than 35% of the consolidated assets of the Parent), to another Person, other than a transaction following which (A) in the case of a merger or
consolidation transaction, holders of securities that represented 100% of the Voting Stock of the Parent immediately prior to such transaction (or other securities into which such securities are converted as part of such merger or consolidation
transaction) own, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the voting power of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation transaction immediately after such transaction and (B) in the case of a sale of assets
transaction, the transferee Person becomes the obligor in respect of the Notes and a Subsidiary of the transferor of such assets; or 
  S-41 


Table of Contents
(5) the Parent ceases to own, directly, 100% of the Capital Stock of the Issuer. 
For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining beneficial ownership under clause (1) above, no Permitted Holder shall be deemed to be
a person or group (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) with Fairfax. 
Fundamental Change shall mean the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Termination of Trading. 
Termination of Trading shall mean the termination (but not the temporary suspension) of trading of the Common Stock
of Parent, which will be deemed to have occurred if the Common Stock or other securities into which the Parents Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are convertible are not, or are not permitted to be, listed for trading on
the New York Stock Exchange or any other U.S. national securities exchange.  Certain Covenants 
The indenture contains, among others, the covenants described below. 
If on any date following the Original Issue Date: 
(1) the notes are rated Baa3 or better by Moodys and BBB- or better by S&P (or, if either such entity ceases to rate the notes for
reasons outside of the control of the Issuer, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act
selected by the Issuer as a replacement agency); and  (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, 
then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants described below will be suspended: 
(1) Limitation on Indebtedness; 
(2) Limitation on Restricted Payments; 
(3) Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries; 
(4) Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock; and 
(5) clause (3) of the covenant described below under the caption Merger and Consolidation. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by either such rating agency should subsequently decline to below Baa3 or BBB-,
respectively, then the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date of such rating decline. For the avoidance of doubt, calculations under the reinstated Limitation on Restricted Payments covenant will be made as if
such covenant had been in effect since April 1, 2011, except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made prior to the date of the Indenture or during the time such that covenant was suspended. 
There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained. 
Limitation on Indebtedness  (a)
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur, directly or indirectly, any Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to Incur Indebtedness (including
revolving credit Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence and after giving effect thereto, no Default has occurred and is continuing and the Maximum Balance Sheet Leverage Ratio is no greater than 1.5 to 1.0. 
  S-42 


Table of Contents
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a), the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will
be entitled to Incur any or all of the following Indebtedness:  (1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer pursuant to any
Credit Facility (including the Credit Agreement); provided, however, that, immediately after giving effect to any such Incurrence, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (1) and then outstanding does not
exceed the greater of (x) $150.0 million and (y) 8.0% of Total Assets;  (2) Indebtedness owed to and held by the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that (A) any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock which results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any subsequent transfer of such
Indebtedness (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute the Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the obligor thereon and (B) if the Issuer is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness
is expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes;  (3) the
Notes (other than any Additional Notes);  (4) Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries outstanding on the Original
Issue Date (other than Indebtedness described in clause (1), (2) or (3) of this covenant);  (5) Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary Incurred and outstanding on or prior to the date on which such Subsidiary was acquired by the Issuer (other than Indebtedness Incurred in connection with, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized
to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Subsidiary became a Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer); provided, however, at the time of such acquisition and after giving effect thereto, the
aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (5) and then outstanding does not exceed $25.0 million; 
(6) Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to paragraph (a) or pursuant to clause (3), (4),
(5), or this clause (6); provided, however, that to the extent such Refinancing Indebtedness directly or indirectly Refinances Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Incurred pursuant to clause (5), such Refinancing Indebtedness shall be Incurred only
by such Subsidiary;  (7) Hedging Obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into in the ordinary
course of business and not for the purpose of speculation;  (8) obligations in respect of letters of credit, performance,
bid and surety bonds, completion guarantees, budget guarantees, payment obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar requirements provided by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business; 
(9) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument
drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of its Incurrence; 
(10) Indebtedness with respect to workers compensation claims in the ordinary course of business; 
(11) any Guarantee (including the Subsidiary Guaranties) by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other
obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is permitted under the terms of the Indenture, 
  S-43 


Table of Contents
(12) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for indemnification,
deposits, adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business, assets or a Subsidiary; provided, however, that (A) such Indebtedness is not
reflected on the balance sheet of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (contingent obligations referred to in a footnote or footnotes to financial statements and not otherwise reflected on the balance sheet will not be deemed to be reflected on
such balance sheet for purposes of this clause (A)) and (B) in the case of a disposition, the maximum liability in respect of such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds including noncash proceeds (the fair market value of such
noncash proceeds being determined at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value) actually received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such disposition; 
(13) Non-Recourse Indebtedness, Permitted Non-Recourse Carve-Out Guarantees and Permitted Co-investments; 
(14) Indebtedness constituting Subordinated Obligations, the net cash proceeds of which are used to purchase, repurchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value the Subordinated Debentures and with a Stated Maturity that is no earlier than 180 days after the Stated Maturity of the Notes; and 
(15) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (together with any refinancing thereof) in an aggregate principal
amount which, when taken together with all other Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the date of such Incurrence (other than Indebtedness permitted by clauses (1) through (14) above or paragraph (a)), does not
exceed the greater of (x) $37.5 million and (y) 2.0% of Total Assets.  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing (except to the extent provided in
the foregoing clause (14)), none of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness pursuant to the foregoing paragraph (b) if the proceeds thereof are used, directly or indirectly, to Refinance any Subordinated Obligations of the
Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor unless such Indebtedness shall be subordinated to the Notes or the applicable Subsidiary Guaranty to at least the same extent as such Subordinated Obligations. 
(d) For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant: (1) any Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement on the Original
Issue Date will be treated as having been incurred on the Original Issue Date under clause (1) of paragraph (b) above; (2) in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described above,
the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness at the time of Incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in one of the above clauses in any manner
that complies with the covenant; and (3) the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indebtedness incurred under the Credit
Agreement will be deemed to have been incurred under clause (1) of paragraph (b) above and the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness. Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely
by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness, but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt, the outstanding
principal amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted only once and any obligations arising under any Guarantee, Lien, letter of credit or similar instrument supporting such Indebtedness shall not be double counted. 
(e) For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness where the Indebtedness Incurred
is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Indebtedness will be the U.S. Dollar Equivalent determined on the date of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, provided, however, that if any such Indebtedness denominated in a
different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to U.S. dollars covering all principal, premium, if any, and interest payable on such 
  S-44 


Table of Contents

Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in U.S. dollars will be as provided in such Currency Agreement. The principal amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the same
currency as the Indebtedness being Refinanced will be the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the Indebtedness Refinanced, except to the extent that (1) such U.S. Dollar Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Agreement, in which case the Refinancing
Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence, and (2) the principal amount of the Refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being Refinanced, in which case the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of
such excess will be determined on the date such Refinancing Indebtedness is Incurred.  (f) In no event shall an Incurrence of Indebtedness
made on the basis of consolidated financial statements prepared in good faith to be in accordance with GAAP be subject to rescission or constitute a Default by reason of any requisite subsequent restatement of such financial statements that would
have made such Incurrence prohibited at the time that it was made.  Limitation on Restricted Payments 
(a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to make a Restricted Payment if at the time
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:  (1) a Default shall have occurred and be
continuing (or would result therefrom);  (2) the Issuer is not entitled to Incur an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness
pursuant to paragraph (a) of the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness; or  (3) the
aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made on or after the Original Issue Date would exceed the sum of (without duplication): 
(A) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period (treated as one accounting period) from April 1, 2011 to the
end of the most recent fiscal quarter ended for which internal financial statements are available prior to the date of such Restricted Payment (or, in case such Consolidated Net Income shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit); plus 
(B) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale of its Capital Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock) subsequent to April 5, 2011 (other than an issuance or sale to a Subsidiary of the Issuer and other than an issuance or sale to an employee stock ownership plan or to a trust established by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
for the benefit of their employees) and 100% of any cash capital contribution received by the Issuer from its shareholders subsequent to the April 5, 2011; plus 
(C) the amount by which Indebtedness of the Issuer is reduced on the Issuers balance sheet upon the conversion or
exchange (other than by a Subsidiary of the Issuer) subsequent to April 5, 2011 of any Indebtedness of the Issuer convertible or exchangeable for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer (less the amount of any cash, or the fair
value of any other property, distributed by the Issuer upon such conversion or exchange); plus  (D) an amount equal to
the sum of the following since April 5, 2011: (x) the net reduction in the Investments (other than Permitted Investments) made by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any Person resulting from repurchases, repayments or redemptions of such
Investments by such Person, payments of interest on Indebtedness, dividends, repayments of loans or advances, or proceeds realized on the sale of such Investment and proceeds representing the return of capital, in each case received by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary since the Original Issue Date, and (y) to the extent such Person is an Unrestricted 
  S-45 


Table of Contents

Subsidiary, the portion (proportionate to the Issuers equity interest in such Subsidiary) of the fair market value of the net assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time such
Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that the foregoing sum in this clause (D) shall not exceed, in the case of any such Person or Unrestricted Subsidiary, the amount of Investments
(excluding Permitted Investments) previously made (and treated as a Restricted Payment) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Person or Unrestricted Subsidiary. 
(b) The preceding provisions will not prohibit: 
(1) (A) any Restricted Payment made out of the Net Cash Proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, or made by
exchange for, Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock and other than Capital Stock issued or sold to a Subsidiary of the Issuer or an employee stock ownership plan or to a trust established by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
for the benefit of their employees) subsequent to the Original Issue Date or (B) any Restricted Payment made out of a substantially concurrent cash capital contribution received by the Issuer from its shareholders subsequent to the Original Issue
Date; provided, however, that (i) such Restricted Payment shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments and (ii) the Net Cash Proceeds from such sale or such cash capital contribution (to the extent so used for
such Restricted Payment) shall be excluded from the calculation of amounts under clause (3)(B) of paragraph (a) above; 
(2) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Subordinated
Obligations of the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Subordinated Obligations which is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under
Limitation on Indebtedness; provided, however, that such purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments;
 (3) dividends paid within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof if at such date of declaration such dividend
would have complied with this covenant; provided, however, that such dividend shall be included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; 
(4) (A) payments or distributions to employees of Parent, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to incentive
plans designed to pay employees amounts reflecting incentive compensation in recognition of performance thresholds achieved by such employees or (B) payments or distributions to employees of Parent, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of
co-investment return, carried interest or other form of incentive compensation or performance fees or any distribution of an equity interest in respect thereof, or any other incentive distributions from Investment
Subsidiaries or Co-investment Vehicles; provided, however, that such payments or distributions shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments;

(14) the payment of any dividend or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer to the holders of its Capital

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant: (1) in the event that a Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than one of
the types of Restricted Payments described in the sub-clauses to clause (b) above, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify all or a portion of such Restricted Payment at the time it is made, or later reclassify all or a

the Issuer determines at the time any such Indebtedness is Incurred (and at the time of any modification of the terms of any such encumbrance or restriction) that any such encumbrance or restriction will not materially affect the Issuers

Board of Directors in good faith);  (C) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to

restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in such predecessor agreements;  (E) any encumbrance or
restriction pursuant to customary restrictions on, or customary conditions to the payment of dividends or other distributions on, equity interests owned by the Issuer or any Subsidiary in any joint venture or similar enterprise contained in the

Indebtedness or Permitted Co-investments, or (ii) the terms of the relevant partnership agreement, limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the entity that is the borrower (or the direct parent of the borrower)

(B) restrictions contained in security agreements, mortgages or other agreements securing Indebtedness of a Restricted

(C) restrictions on the transfer of assets subject to any Lien permitted under the Indenture imposed by the holder of such
Lien;  (D) any restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary or its assets imposed pursuant to an agreement entered

or in the aggregate, detract from the value of the property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in a manner material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 
Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock 
(a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:
 (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least
equal to the fair market value (including as to the value of all noncash consideration), as determined in good faith by members of the Issuers senior management, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition; 
(2) at least 75% of the consideration thereof received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash
or cash equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments or Replacement Assets or a combination of cash and cash equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments, and Replacement Assets; provided, however, that with respect to the sale of one or more real
estate properties or related property, plant and equipment, or loans secured by real estate, up to 75% of the consideration may consist of Indebtedness of the purchaser of such real estate properties or related property, plant and equipment, or
loans secured by real estate, so long as such Indebtedness is secured by a first or second priority Lien on the real estate property or properties or related property, plant and equipment, or loans secured by real estate, sold; 
(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Issuer (or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be):  (A) first, to the extent the Issuer elects (or is required by the terms of
any Indebtedness), to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness (other than Disqualified Stock) of any other Wholly Owned Subsidiary (in each case other than Indebtedness owed
to the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer) within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; 
  S-50 


Table of Contents
(B) second, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after
application in accordance with clause (A), to the extent the Issuer elects, to make a capital expenditure or to acquire Replacement Assets within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available
Cash; and  (C) third, to the extent of the Excess Proceeds (as defined below), to make an offer to the holders of the
Notes (and to holders of other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer designated by the Issuer) to purchase Notes (and such other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) pursuant to and subject to the conditions contained in the Indenture; 
provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (A) or (C)
above (excluding temporary reductions of revolving credit indebtedness made pursuant to the covenant described in the last sentence of the next paragraph), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary shall permanently retire such Indebtedness and shall
cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; provided further, however, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with clause (B)
above if and to the extent that, within 365 days after the later of the Asset Disposition or the receipt of Net Available Cash, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has entered into and not abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to
make a capital expenditure or to acquire Replacement Assets, and that such capital expenditure or acquisition is thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such 365-day period. 
The Net Available Cash of an Asset Disposition not applied pursuant to clauses (3)(A) and (B) above constitute Excess
Proceeds. Excess Proceeds of less than $10.0 million will be carried forward and accumulated. When accumulated Excess Proceeds equal or exceed such amount, the Issuer must, within 30 days, make an offer to purchase the Notes, in
accordance with clause (3)(C) above. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, such Net Available Cash shall be invested in Temporary Cash Investments or applied to temporarily reduce revolving credit indebtedness. 
For the purposes of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents: 
(1) the assumption of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; and  (2) securities received
by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of receipt. 
(b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes (and other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) pursuant to clause
(a)(3)(C) above, the Issuer will purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Issuer for the Notes (and such other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, (or, in respect of such other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, such
lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price
of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Issuer will select the securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Notes will be denominations of
$2,000 principal amount or integral multiples of $1,000 greater thereof. The Issuer shall not be required to make such an offer to purchase Notes (and other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) pursuant to this covenant if the Excess Proceeds are less
than $5.0 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition).

Table of Contents
(c) The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of
the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this clause by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. 
Limitation on Affiliate Transactions 
(a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or permit to exist any transaction (including the
purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property, employee compensation arrangements or the rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (an Affiliate Transaction) unless: 
(1) the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary than those
that could be obtained at the time of the Affiliate Transaction in arms-length dealings with a Person who is not an Affiliate; 
(2) if such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $25.0 million, the terms of the Affiliate Transaction
are set forth in writing and a majority of the directors of the Issuer disinterested with respect to such Affiliate Transaction have determined in good faith that the criteria set forth in clause (1) are satisfied and have approved the relevant
Affiliate Transaction as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors; and  (3) if such Affiliate Transaction
involves an amount in excess of $50.0 million, the Board of Directors shall also have received a written opinion from an Independent Qualified Party to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Issuer or
the applicable Restricted Subsidiary or is not less favorable to the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary than could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time in an arms-length transaction with a Person who was not an
Affiliate.  (b) The provisions of the preceding paragraph (a) will not prohibit: 
(1) any Investment or other Restricted Payment, in each case not prohibited pursuant to the covenant described under
Limitation on Restricted Payments;  (2) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or
grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment arrangements, stock options and stock ownership plans approved by the Board of Directors; 
(3) loans or advances to employees or consultants in the ordinary course of business of the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries;  (4) the payment of reasonable fees and compensation to, or the provision of employee benefit
arrangements and indemnity for the benefit of, directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business; 
(5) any transaction between or among the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary, any Co-investment Vehicle or joint venture or
similar entity (including any separate account or investment program managed, operated or sponsored by an Investment Subsidiary) which would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity
interest in or otherwise controls such Restricted Subsidiary, Co-investment Vehicle, joint venture or similar entity (including any separate account or investment program managed, operated or sponsored by an Investment Subsidiary); 
  S-52 


Table of Contents
(6) the issuance or sale of any Capital Stock (other than Disqualified
Stock) of the Issuer or Parent;  (7) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries of its obligations under the terms of any stockholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) or warrant agreement to which it is a party as of the Original Issue Date and any
similar agreements which it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of obligations under any future amendment to any such existing
agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Original Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the noteholders
in any material respect;  (8) any agreement as in effect on the Original Issue Date and described or incorporated by
reference in this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus, or any renewals, extensions or amendments of any such agreement (so long as such renewals, extensions or amendments are not less favorable to the Issuer or the Restricted
Subsidiaries) and the transactions evidenced thereby;  (9) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or
purchasers or sellers of goods or services in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the applicable Indenture which are fair to the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party; and 
(10) the repurchase or other acquisition of the Parents warrants outstanding as of the Original Issue Date,
pursuant to the terms of a plan (or amendment thereto) approved by the Board of Directors of Parent.  Limitation on Liens 
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Incur or permit to exist any Lien (the
Initial Lien) of any nature whatsoever on any of its properties (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned at the Original Issue Date or thereafter acquired, securing any Obligations, other than
Permitted Liens, without effectively providing that the Notes (or a Subsidiary Guaranty in the case of an Initial Lien of a Subsidiary Guarantor) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or, in the event the Lien related to Subordinated
Obligations, prior to) the Obligations so secured for so long as such Obligations are so secured. Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien.  Limitation on Sale/Leaseback
Transactions  The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale/Leaseback Transaction
with respect to any property unless:  (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to (A) Incur Indebtedness in an
amount equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale/Leaseback Transaction pursuant to the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness and (B) create a Lien on such property securing such Attributable Debt
without equally and ratably securing the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under Limitation on Liens;  (2) the
net proceeds received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such Sale/ Leaseback Transaction are at least equal to the fair value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Issuer) of such property; and

(3) the Issuer applies the proceeds of such transaction in compliance with the covenant described
under Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.  Merger and Consolidation 
The provisions described below apply to the Notes and the Guaranties in lieu of the provisions described in the accompanying prospectus under
the heading Description of Debt SecuritiesConsolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets. The provisions described below apply only to the Notes and the Guaranties and not to any other series of debt securities or related guaranties
issued pursuant to the Base Indenture.  The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless:  (1) the
resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the Successor Company) shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor
Company (if not the Issuer) shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental thereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture; 
(2) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor
Company or any Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by such Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; 
(3) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, the Successor Company would be able to Incur an additional $1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph (a) of the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness; and  (4) the Issuer
shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture; 
provided, however, that clause (3) will not be applicable to (A) a Restricted Subsidiary consolidating with, merging into or transferring all or part
of its properties and assets to the Issuer or (B) the Issuer merging with an Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose and with the sole effect of reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction. 
The Successor Company will be the successor to the Issuer and shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Indenture, and the predecessor Issuer, except in the case of a lease, shall be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes. 
The Issuer will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of its assets to any Person unless:  (1) except in the case of a
Subsidiary Guarantor that has been disposed of in its entirety to another Person (other than to the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer), whether through a merger, consolidation or sale of Capital Stock or assets, if in connection therewith the
Issuer provides an Officers Certificate to the Trustee stating that the Issuer will comply with its obligations under the covenant described under Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock in respect of such
disposition, the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not such Subsidiary) shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the jurisdiction under which such Subsidiary was organized or under the laws of the United States of
America, or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and such Person shall expressly assume, by a Guaranty Agreement, all the obligations of such Subsidiary, if any, under its Subsidiary Guaranty;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or transactions on a pro forma basis (and
treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the resulting, surviving or transferee Person as a result of such transaction as having been issued by such Person at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing; and  (3) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and such Guaranty Agreement, if any, complies with the Indenture.  Parent will not consolidate with or
merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of its assets to any Person unless: 
(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not Parent) shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States
of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and such Person shall expressly assume, by a Guaranty Agreement, all the obligations of Parent, if any, under its Guaranty; 
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or transactions on a pro forma basis (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an
obligation of the resulting, surviving or transferee Person as a result of such transaction as having been issued by such Person at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and 
(3) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger
or transfer and such Guaranty Agreement, if any, complies with the Indenture.  Future Guarantors 
On the Original Issue Date, Parent and the initial Subsidiary Guarantors executed and delivered the Supplemental Indenture agreeing to fully
and unconditionally Guarantee the Notes (including any Additional Notes) on an unsecured, senior basis. After the Original Issue Date, certain additional Subsidiary Guarantors executed supplemental indentures agreeing to fully and unconditionally
Guarantee the Notes (including any Additional Notes) on an unsecured, senior basis. The Issuer has covenanted that, after the Original Issue Date, it will cause each domestic Restricted Subsidiary (other than (i) any Excluded Subsidiary and (ii)
Restricted Subsidiary prohibited from providing a Guarantee by any agreement governing Non-Recourse Indebtedness (or the terms of the relevant partnership agreement, limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the
entity that is the borrower (or the direct parent of the borrower) under any Non-Recourse Indebtedness), any joint venture agreement or the terms of any Co-investment Vehicle or any separate account or investment program managed, operated or
sponsored by an Investment Subsidiary) to execute and deliver to the Trustee a Guaranty Agreement pursuant to which such domestic Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the Notes on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the
Indenture.  Not all of our subsidiaries that acquire properties or other assets in the future will become guarantors of the Notes. For
example, the terms of the Non-Recourse Indebtedness agreements, partnership agreements, limited liability company operating agreements, other governing documents, joint venture agreements, Co-investment Vehicles, separate accounts and investment
programs referred to above may prohibit the relevant subsidiary from guaranteeing the Notes. In many cases, the Indenture does not require these subsidiaries to guarantee the Notes. Accordingly, noteholders will not have a direct claim against these
subsidiaries for payments on the Notes. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesThe notes will not be guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries. 
SEC Reports  Notwithstanding that
the Issuer may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer will file with the SEC and make available to the Trustee and noteholders

and deliver a copy to the Trustee within 15 days after it files them with the SEC such annual reports and such information, documents and other reports as are specified in Sections 13(a) and
15(d) of the Exchange Act and applicable to a U.S. corporation subject to such Sections, such information, documents and other reports to be so filed with the SEC at the times specified for the filings of such information, documents and reports
under such Sections; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filing, in which event the Issuer will make available such information to noteholders
and deliver a copy to the Trustee within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; provided further, however, that (a)
so long as Parent is the Guarantor of the Notes, the reports, information and other documents required to be filed and provided as described hereunder may, at the Issuers option, be filed by and be those of Parent rather than the Issuer and
(b) in the event that Parent conducts any business or holds any significant assets other than the capital stock of the Issuer at the time of filing and providing any such report, information or other document containing financial statements of
Parent, Parent shall include in such report, information or other document summarized financial information (as defined in Rule 1-02(bb) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC) with respect to the Issuer; provided further, however,
that in no event shall the Issuer or Parent be required to make available to the Trustee or noteholders any material for which the Issuer or Parent is seeking, or has received, confidential treatment by the SEC, or any correspondence with the SEC or
its staff. For purposes of this covenant, reports, information and documents publicly available on the SECs EDGAR system (or any successor thereto) shall be deemed to be available to the Trustee and noteholders. 
Defaults  The provisions described below
apply to the Notes and the Guaranties in lieu of the provisions described in the accompanying prospectus under the heading Description of Debt SecuritiesEvents of Default. The provisions described below apply only to the Notes and
the Guaranties and not to any other series of debt securities or related guaranties issued pursuant to the Base Indenture.  Each of the
following is an Event of Default:  (1) a default in the payment of interest on the Notes when due, continued for 30 days; 
(2) a default in the payment of principal of any Note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon redemption, upon required purchase, upon
declaration of acceleration or otherwise;  (3) the failure by the Issuer, Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply with its
obligations under Certain CovenantsMerger and Consolidation;  (4) the failure by the Issuer, Parent or any
Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, to comply for 60 days after receipt of written notice with any of its agreements contained in the Indenture (other than any other agreement specifically referred to in any of the other clauses of this
definition of Event of Default), including its obligations in the covenants described above under Fundamental Change (other than a failure to purchase Notes), Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness,
Certain CovenantsLimitation on Restricted Payments, Certain CovenantsLimitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries, Certain CovenantsLimitation on Sales of
Assets and Subsidiary Stock (other than a failure to purchase Notes), Certain CovenantsLimitation on Affiliate Transactions, Certain CovenantsLimitation on Liens, Certain
CovenantsLimitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions or Certain CovenantsFuture Guarantors;  (5) the
failure by the Issuer or Parent, as the case may be, to comply for 180 days after receipt of written notice with any of its obligations in the covenant described above under Certain CovenantsSEC Reports (provided that,
if applicable, failure by the Issuer or Parent to comply with the provisions of Section 314(a) of the Trust Indenture Act will not in itself be deemed a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture);

(6) (a) Indebtedness (other than Non-Recourse Indebtedness) of the Issuer, any Subsidiary
Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary is not paid within any applicable grace period after final maturity or is accelerated by the holders thereof because of a default and the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $30.0
million or (b) three or more unrelated instances at any one time where Non-Recourse Indebtedness of the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary is not paid within any applicable grace period after final maturity or is
accelerated by the holders thereof because of a default and the aggregate amount of such Non-Recourse Indebtedness that remains unpaid or accelerated exceeds the greater of (i) $200.0 million and (ii) 10% of Total Assets (clauses (a) and (b),
together, the cross acceleration provision);  (7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of
the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary (the bankruptcy provisions);  (8) any final
judgment or decree for the payment of money (other than judgments which are covered by enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent carriers) in excess of $20.0 million is entered against the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant
Subsidiary, remains outstanding for a period of 60 consecutive days following such judgment becoming final and is not discharged, waived or stayed within 10 days after notice (the judgment default provision); or 
(9) the Parent Guaranty or a Subsidiary Guaranty ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such
Guaranty) or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guaranty.  However, a default under clause (4), (5) or (8) will
not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Issuer or the holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer with a copy to the Trustee of the default in writing and the Issuer does not cure such
default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. In the event of any Event of Default specified under clause (6), such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of
acceleration of Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose: (a) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration,
notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (b) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. 
No Event of Default with respect to a particular series of debt securities under the Base Indenture (except as to certain events of
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) necessarily constitutes an event of default with respect to any other series of debt securities under the Base Indenture. The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration under the Indenture
may constitute an event of default under certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries outstanding from time to time.  If
an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon
such declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal of and interest
on all the Notes will ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders of the Notes. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount
of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences.  In case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the Notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or
security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the
Notes unless:  (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; 
  S-57 


Table of Contents
(2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;  (3) such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense;  (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of
security or indemnity; and  (5) holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction
inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.  Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount
of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to
follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, holders of the Notes will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive
payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Notes on or after the due dates expressed in the Indenture and the Notes and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment. 
If a Default occurs, is continuing and the Trustee has received notice thereof, the Trustee must mail to each holder of the Notes notice of
the Default within 90 days after the Trustee receives such notice. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its trust officers determines
that withholding notice is not opposed to the interest of the holders of the Notes. In addition, we are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know
of any Default that occurred during the previous year. We are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action we are
taking or propose to take in respect thereof.  As to the waiver of defaults, see Amendments and Waivers. 
Amendments and Waivers  The Base
Indenture or any debt security (other than the Notes) of a series established pursuant to the Base Indenture may be amended in the manner set forth in the accompanying prospectus under the heading Description of Debt
SecuritiesModification and Waiver. However, an amendment to the Base Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or the Guaranties that amends, supplements or modifies the terms of the Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or the
Guaranties must satisfy the provisions described in this Amendments and Waivers section in lieu of the provisions described in the accompanying prospectus under the heading Description of Debt SecuritiesModification and
Waiver. The provisions described below apply only to the Notes and the Guaranties and not to any other series of debt securities or related guaranties issued pursuant to the Base Indenture. 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture may be amended with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for the Notes) and any past default or compliance with any provisions may also be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding. However, without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note affected thereby, an amendment or waiver may not, among other things: 
(1) reduce the amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment; 
  S-58 


Table of Contents
(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note; 
(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note; 
(4) reduce the amount payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be redeemed as described under
Optional Redemption;  (5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes; 
(6) impair the right of any holder of the Notes to receive payment of principal of and interest on such holders Notes on or after the
due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holders Notes;  (7) make any
change in the amendment provisions which require each holders consent or in the waiver provisions;  (8) make any change in the
ranking or priority of any Note or Guaranty that would adversely affect the noteholders; or  (9) voluntarily release a Subsidiary
Guarantor other than in accordance with the Indenture.  Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of the Notes, the
Issuer, Parent, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Trustee may amend the Indenture:  (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency;  (2) to provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Issuer, Parent or any Subsidiary
Guarantor under the Indenture;  (3) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided
that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code);  (4) to add guarantees with
respect to the Notes, including any Subsidiary Guaranties, or to secure the Notes;  (5) to add to the covenants of the Issuer, Parent or
any Subsidiary Guarantor for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer, Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor; 
(6) to make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any holder of the Notes; 
(7) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with any required qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;
 (8) to conform the text of the Indenture, Guaranties or the Notes to any provision of this Description of the Notes to the
extent that such provision was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Guaranties or the Notes as certified in an Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee; or 
(9) to amend the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance
with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer
Notes, except as required by law. 
  S-59 


Table of Contents
The consent of the holders of the Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.  After an
amendment under the Indenture becomes effective, we are required to deliver electronically, if held at DTC, or mail to holders of the Notes a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all holders of the
Notes, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.  Neither the Issuer nor any Affiliate of the Issuer
may, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the
Notes unless such consideration is offered to all holders and is paid to all holders that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. 
Transfer  The Notes will be issued in
registered form and will be transferable only upon the surrender of the Notes being transferred for registration of transfer. We may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or other governmental charge payable in connection
with certain transfers and exchanges.  Defeasance and Satisfaction and Discharge 
The provisions described below apply to the Notes and the Guaranties in lieu of the provisions described in the accompanying prospectus under
the heading Description of Debt SecuritiesDefeasance of Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain Circumstances. The provisions described below apply only to the Notes and the Guaranties and not to any other series of debt
securities or related guaranties issued pursuant to the Base Indenture.  At any time, we may terminate all our and each Guarantors
obligations with respect to the Notes or the Guaranties under the Notes, the Guaranties and the Indenture (legal defeasance), except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations
to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the Notes. 
In addition, at any time we may terminate our obligations under Fundamental Change and under the covenants described under
Certain Covenants (other than the covenant described under Merger and Consolidation), the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries and the
judgment default provision described under Defaults above and the limitations contained in clause (3) of the first paragraph under Certain CovenantsMerger and Consolidation above and our Guarantors
obligations under the Guaranties and the Indenture (covenant defeasance).  We may exercise our legal defeasance
option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option. If we exercise our legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If we exercise our covenant
defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (4), (5), (7), (8) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries) or (9) under Defaults above or because of the
failure of the Issuer to comply with clause (3) of the first paragraph under Certain CovenantsMerger and Consolidation above. If we exercise our legal defeasance option or our covenant defeasance option, each Guarantor will
be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Guaranty. 
  S-60 


Table of Contents
In order to exercise either of our defeasance options, we must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
defeasance trust) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions,
including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject
to federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a
ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable federal income tax law).  In addition, the Issuers obligations
under the Notes and with respect to the Notes under the Indenture, and each Guarantors obligations under its Guaranty, will terminate (a satisfaction and discharge), subject to certain limitations set forth in the
Indenture, if:  (1) all Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than (i) destroyed, lost or stolen Notes that have been
replaced or (ii) Notes that are paid or (iii) Notes for whose payment money or U.S. Government Obligations have been held in trust and then repaid to the Issuer in accordance with the Indenture) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
and the Issuer has paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; or  (2) (A) the Notes mature within 60 days, or all of them are to be
called for redemption within 60 days under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for giving the notice of redemption, 
(B) the Issuer irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee, as trust funds solely for the benefit of the holders, money or
U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certificate delivered to the Trustee, without consideration of any reinvestment,
to pay principal of and interest on the Notes to maturity or redemption, as the case may be, and to pay all other sums payable by it hereunder, 
(C) no Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the deposit, 
(D) the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the Indenture or any other
agreement or instrument to which the Issuer is a party or by which it is bound, and  (E) the Issuer delivers to the
Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in each case stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. 
Concerning the Trustee  Wilmington
Trust, National Association is to be the Trustee under the Indenture. We have appointed Wilmington Trust, National Association as Registrar and Paying Agent with regard to the Notes. 
The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of
claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; provided, however, if it acquires any conflicting
interest and the Notes are in default, it must either eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign. 
Subject to certain rights of the Trustee, holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any 
  S-61

remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. If an Event of Default occurs (and is not cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of
care of a prudent person in the conduct of such persons affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder shall have offered
to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.  No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers,
Employees and Stockholders  No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or stockholder or control person of the Issuer, the
Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, the Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Notes, any Guaranty or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such
obligations or their creation. Each holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.  Governing Law 
The Indenture, the Notes and the Guaranties, including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Indenture, the Notes or the
Guaranties, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof, other than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law). 
Certain Definitions 
Affiliate of any specified Person means any other Person, directly or indirectly, controlling or controlled by or
under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person. For the purposes of this definition, control when used with respect to any Person means the power to direct the management and policies of such Person, directly or
indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms controlling and controlled have meanings correlative to the foregoing. For purposes of the covenants described under

only, Affiliate shall also mean any beneficial owner of Capital Stock representing 10% or more of the total voting power of the Voting Stock (on a fully diluted basis) of the Issuer or of rights or warrants to purchase such Capital Stock
(whether or not currently exercisable) and any Person who would be an Affiliate of any such beneficial owner pursuant to the first sentence hereof. Solely for purposes of the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on
Affiliate Transactions the term Affiliate shall be deemed to exclude Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of Canada, or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof (collectively, Fairfax);
provided, however, that Fairfax will be deemed to be an Affiliate of the Issuer for purposes of clause (1) under paragraph (a) of Certain CovenantsLimitation on Affiliate Transactions and shall
comply with the requirements set forth under such clause; provided further, however, that such requirements shall be deemed to have been satisfied in respect of any agreement as in effect on the Original Issue Date or any renewals,
extension or amendments of any such agreements (so long as such renewals, extensions or amendments are not less favorable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) and the transactions evidenced thereby. 
Asset Disposition means any sale, lease, transfer or other disposition (or series of related sales, leases,
transfers or dispositions) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, including any disposition by means of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction (each referred to for the purposes of this definition as a disposition), of: 
(1) any shares of Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than directors qualifying shares or shares required by applicable law
to be held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary); 
  S-62 


Table of Contents
(2) all or substantially all the assets of any division or line of business of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary; or  (3) any other assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary outside of the ordinary course of business of

(C) any sale of Capital Stock in, or Indebtedness or other securities of, an Unrestricted Subsidiary; 
(D) a disposition of Temporary Cash Investments in the ordinary course of business;

each case by an Investment Subsidiary or Co-investment Vehicle; and  (H) a disposition of assets with a fair market value of less than
$5.0 million (a de minimis disposition);  provided, however, that a disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole will be governed by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption Fundamental Change and/or the provisions described above under the caption
Certain CovenantsMerger and Consolidation and not by the provisions described above under the caption Certain CovenantsLimitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock covenant. 
Attributable Debt in respect of a Sale/Leaseback Transaction means, as at the time of determination, the present
value (discounted at the interest rate borne by the Notes, compounded annually) of the total obligations of the lessee for rental payments during the remaining term of the lease included in such Sale/ Leaseback Transaction (including any period for
which such lease has been extended); provided, however, that if such Sale/Leaseback Transaction results in a Capital Lease Obligation, the amount of Indebtedness represented thereby will be determined in accordance with the definition
of Capital Lease Obligation.  Average Life means, as of the date of determination, with respect to
any Indebtedness, the quotient obtained by dividing:  (1) the sum of the products of the number of years from the date of determination to
the dates of each successive scheduled principal payment of or redemption or similar payment with respect to such Indebtedness multiplied by the amount of such payment by 
(2) the sum of all such payments.

real property entered into in the ordinary course of business of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries.  Capital
Stock of any Person means any and all shares, interests, rights to purchase, warrants, options, participations or other equivalents of or interests in (however designated) equity of such Person, whether outstanding at the Original

(b) the net income or net loss of any Person, other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, except that, subject to the exclusion

Restricted Subsidiary, to the limitation contained in clause (a) above) shall be included in determining Consolidated Net Income,  (c) the

such determination.  Except as described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness, whenever it is
necessary to determine whether the Issuer has complied with any covenant in the Indenture or a Default has occurred and an amount is expressed in a currency other than U.S. dollars, such amount will be treated as the U.S. Dollar Equivalent
determined as of the date such amount is initially determined in such currency.  U.S. Government Obligations
means direct obligations (or certificates representing an ownership interest in such obligations) of the United States of America (including any agency or instrumentality thereof) for the payment of which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged and which are not callable at the issuers option.  Voting Stock of a Person
means all classes of Capital Stock or other interests (including partnership interests) of such Person then outstanding and normally entitled (without regard to the occurrence of any contingency) to vote in the election of directors, managers or
trustees thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, if the capital structure of such Person includes both (x) capital or similar interests and (y) profit, promote or similar interests, then Voting Stock shall be deemed to refer only to such
capital or similar interests and not to such profit, promote or similar interests.  Wholly Owned
Subsidiary means a Restricted Subsidiary all the Capital Stock of which (other than directors qualifying shares) is owned by the Issuer or one or more Wholly Owned Subsidiaries. 
Book-Entry, Delivery and Form  Except as
set forth below, Notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately
available funds.  The Notes will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
(collectively, the Global Notes). The Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the Trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company ( DTC), and registered in the name of DTC or its
nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below.  Except as set forth below,
the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be exchanged for Notes in certificated form except in the limited
circumstances described below. See Book-Entry, Delivery and FormExchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes. Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not
be entitled to receive physical delivery of Notes in certificated form.  Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be
subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants, which may change from time to time.  Depository
Procedures  The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC are provided solely as a matter of convenience.
These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their
participants directly to discuss these matters.  DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities
for its participating organizations (collectively, the Participants) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the underwriters of the Notes), 
  S-83

banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTCs system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the Indirect Participants). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by
or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and
Indirect Participants.  DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: 
(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the underwriters of the Notes with portions
of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and  (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer
of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global
Notes).  Investors in the Global Notes who are Participants in DTCs system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC.
Investors in the Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations that are Participants in such system. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC.
The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent.
Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC
system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. 
Except as described below, owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical
delivery of Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the Indenture for any purpose. 
Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest, if any, on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable
to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the Notes
for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: 
(1) any aspect of DTCs records or any Participants or Indirect Participants records relating to or payments made on account
of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTCs records or any Participants or Indirect Participants records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global
Notes; or  (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. 
DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and
interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount
proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed
by standing instructions and customary 
  S-84 


Table of Contents

practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee
will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for
all purposes.  Transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTCs procedures, and will be settled in
same-day funds.  DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction
of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such
direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Notes to its Participants. 
Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, DTC is
under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC or its direct or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. 
Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes 
A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if: 
(1) DTC (a) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes and DTC fails to appoint a
successor depositary or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act;  (2) the Issuer, at its option, notifies
the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the Certificated Notes; or  (3) there has occurred and is continuing a
Default with respect to the Notes and the Trustee has received a request from DTC to issue certificated notes.  In addition, beneficial
interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes under prior written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the Indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or
beneficial interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures). 
Same Day Settlement and Payment 
The Issuer will make payments in respect of the Notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal and interest, if any) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Global Note holder. The Issuer will make all payments of principal and interest, if any, with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holders registered address. The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to trade in DTCs
Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes
will also be settled in immediately available funds.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or
non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative
pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be
applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect an owner of the notes. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a
contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes.  This
discussion is limited to beneficial owners who hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the
notes for cash pursuant to this offering at the public offering price indicated on the cover page of this prospectus supplement. This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to an owners particular
circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to persons subject to special rules, including, without limitation: 
 


 

 
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;   


 

 
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;   


 

 
U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;   


 

 
persons holding the notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment; 
 


 

 
banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;   


 

 
real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;   


 

 
brokers, dealers or traders in securities;   


 

 
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; 
 


 

 
S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein); 
 


 

 
tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; and   


 

 
persons deemed to sell the notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.  If an
entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at
the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding the notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.

THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX
ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING
ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.  Qualified
Reopening  For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect and the following discussion assumes that the notes will be treated as
issued in a qualified reopening of the initial notes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, debt instruments issued in a qualified reopening are deemed to be part of the same issue as the original debt instruments. Under the treatment
described in this paragraph, the notes will have the same issue date and the same issue price as the initial notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
Tax Considerations Applicable to U.S. Holders 
Definition of a U.S. Holder  For
purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of a note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as:   


 

 
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;   


 

 
a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;   


 

 
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or   


 

 
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more United States persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid
election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Pre-Acquisition Accrued Interest
 A portion of the price paid for a note will be allocable to interest that accrued prior to the date the note is
purchased (pre-acquisition accrued interest). We intend to take the position that, to the extent a portion of a U.S. Holders purchase price is allocable to pre-acquisition accrued interest, a portion of the first stated interest
payment equal to the amount of such pre-acquisition accrued interest will be treated as a nontaxable return of such pre-acquisition accrued interest to the U.S. Holder. Amounts treated as a return of pre-acquisition accrued interest should not be
taxable when received but should reduce a U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in the note by a corresponding amount.  Payments of Stated Interest
 Payments of stated interest on a note (other than pre-acquisition accrued interest) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as
ordinary income at the time such interest is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holders method of tax accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
Certain Additional Payments  In
certain circumstances (see Description of the NotesOptional Redemption and Description of the NotesFundamental Change), we may be obligated to make payments in excess of stated interest and the

  S-87 


Table of Contents

principal amount of the notes. We intend to take the position that the notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of these additional payments. This position is
based in part on assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the date of issuance of the notes, that such additional payments will have to be made. Assuming this position is respected, any amounts paid to a U.S. Holder pursuant to any such
redemption or repurchase, as applicable, would be taxable as described below in Tax Considerations Applicable to U.S. HoldersSale or Other Taxable Disposition. Our position is binding on a U.S. Holder unless such holder
discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. The IRS, however, may take a position contrary to our position, which could affect the timing and character of a U.S. Holders income with respect to the
notes. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes and the consequences thereof. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are
not treated as contingent payment debt instruments.  Premium 
If a U.S. Holder purchases a note for an amount (excluding any portion thereof allocable to pre-acquisition accrued interest) that exceeds the
notes principal amount, the U.S. Holder will be considered to have purchased the note with amortizable bond premium in an amount equal to the excess. Generally, a U.S. Holder may elect to amortize the premium as an offset to
interest, using a constant-yield method, over the remaining term of the notes. However, because the notes may be optionally redeemed by us for an amount in excess of their principal amount, special rules apply that could result in a deferral of the
amortization of the bond premium until later in the term of the notes. Under the Treasury Regulations, a U.S. Holder may offset the stated interest income allocable to an accrual period with the bond premium allocable to the accrual period. If the
bond premium allocable to an accrual period exceeds the stated interest income allocable to the accrual period, the excess is treated as a bond premium deduction. However, the amount treated as a bond premium deduction is limited to the amount by
which such U.S. Holders total interest inclusions on the notes in prior accrual periods exceed the total amount treated by such holder as a bond premium deduction in prior accrual periods. If any of the excess bond premium is not deductible,
that amount is carried forward to the next accrual period. If a U.S. Holder elects to amortize bond premium, the U.S. Holder must reduce its adjusted tax basis in the notes by the amount of the bond premium used to offset interest income as set
forth above. An election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations held or subsequently acquired by the U.S. Holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies and may be revoked only with
the consent of the IRS.  Sale or Other Taxable Disposition 
A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note. The amount of
such gain or loss will generally equal the difference between the amount received for the note in cash or other property valued at fair market value (less amounts attributable to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as a
payment of interest) and the U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in the note. A U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in a note generally will be equal to the amount the U.S. Holder paid for the note, reduced by amortized bond premium and by any
pre-acquisition accrued interest previously received. Any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the note for more than one year at the time of sale or other taxable
disposition. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, generally are eligible for taxation at reduced rates. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.  Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
A U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding when such holder receives payments on a note or proceeds from the
sale or other taxable disposition of a note (including a 
  S-88 


Table of Contents

redemption or retirement of a note). Certain U.S. Holders are exempt from backup withholding, including corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations. A U.S. Holder will be subject
to backup withholding if such holder is not otherwise exempt and such holder:   


 

 
fails to furnish its taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is ordinarily his or her social security number;   


 

 
furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number;   


 

 
is notified by the IRS that it previously failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or   


 

 
fails to certify under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the IRS has not notified it that it is subject to backup withholding. 
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit
against a U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup withholding
and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.  Tax Considerations Applicable to Non-U.S. Holders 
Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder 
For purposes of this discussion, a Non-U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of a note that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Payments of Interest 
Interest paid on a note to a Non-U.S. Holder that is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or business
within the United States generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, or withholding tax of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), provided that: 
 


 

 
the Non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock; 
 


 

 
the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us through actual or constructive stock ownership; and   


 

 
either (1) the Non-U.S. Holder certifies in a statement provided to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it is not a United States person and provides its name and address; (2) a securities
clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds the note on behalf of the Non-U.S. Holder certifies to the applicable withholding agent under
penalties of perjury that it, or the financial institution between it and the Non-U.S. Holder, has received from the Non-U.S. Holder a statement under penalties of perjury that such holder is not a United States person and provides a copy of such
statement to the applicable withholding agent; or (3) the Non-U.S. Holder holds its note directly through a qualified intermediary (within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations) and certain conditions are satisfied.

  S-89 


Table of Contents
If a Non-U.S. Holder does not satisfy the requirements above, such Non-U.S. Holder may be
entitled to a reduction in or an exemption from withholding on such interest as a result of an applicable tax treaty. To claim such entitlement, the Non-U.S. Holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form
W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) claiming a reduction in or exemption from withholding tax under the benefit of an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is
established.  If interest paid to a Non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or
business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such interest is attributable), the Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the
U.S. federal withholding tax described above. To claim the exemption, the Non-U.S. Holder must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that interest paid on a note is not subject to withholding tax because it
is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business within the United States.  Any such effectively
connected interest generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular graduated rates. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an
applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected interest, as adjusted for certain items.  The certifications described above
must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. Holders that do not timely provide the applicable withholding agent with the required certification, but that
qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding
their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty.  Sale or Other Taxable Disposition 
A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a note (such amount excludes any amount allocable to accrued and unpaid interest, which generally will be treated as interest and may be subject to the rules discussed above in Tax
Considerations Applicable to Non-U.S. HoldersPayments of Interest) unless:   


 

 
the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a permanent
establishment in the United States to which such gain is attributable); or   


 

 
the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and certain other requirements are met. 
Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net-income basis at the regular
graduated rates. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for
certain items.  Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower
rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely
filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. 
  S-90 


Table of Contents
Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable income tax treaties
that may provide for different rules.  Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
Payments of interest generally will not be subject to backup withholding, provided the applicable withholding agent does not have actual
knowledge or reason to know the Non-U.S. Holder is a United States person and the Non-U.S. Holder certifies its non-U.S. status as described above under Tax Considerations Applicable to Non-U.S. HoldersPayments of Interest.
However, information returns are required to be filed with the IRS in connection with any interest paid to the Non-U.S. Holder, regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld. In addition, proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition of a
note (including a retirement or redemption of the note) within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related brokers generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting if the applicable withholding agent
receives the statement described above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the Non-U.S. Holder is a United States person or the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds of a disposition of a note paid
outside the United States and conducted through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting, unless the broker has certain connections to the United States. 
Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions of an applicable treaty or agreement
to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established.  Backup withholding is not an additional
tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. 
Additional Withholding Tax on Payments Made to Foreign Accounts 
Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act, or FATCA) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on payments of interest on, or gross proceeds from the
sale or other disposition of, a note paid to a foreign financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity (each as defined in the Code), unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and
reporting obligations, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies that it does not have any substantial United States owners (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United
States owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements
in (1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain specified United States persons or United States-owned
foreign entities (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial
institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. 
Under the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies currently to payments of
interest on our debt obligations, and will apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of debt obligations occurring on or after January 1, 2019. However, a debt obligation issued prior to July 1, 2014 (including any debt
obligation issued on or after July 1, 2014 in a qualified reopening of an existing debt obligation issued prior to such date) is exempt from the withholding under FATCA, unless it is significantly modified on or after such date. Assuming the notes
are treated as issued in a 
  S-91 


Table of Contents

qualified reopening of the initial notes, which were issued prior to July 1, 2014, the notes as well as the initial notes will be grandfathered from withholding under FATCA. Prospective investors
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible impact of these rules on their investment in the notes, and on the entities through which they hold the notes.

CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS 
The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes by (a) employee benefit plans that
are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), (b) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code (the
Code) or provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws, rules or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, Similar Laws), and (c) entities whose underlying assets
are considered to include plan assets (within the meaning of ERISA) of any such plan, account or arrangement by reason of a plans investment in such entities (each of (a), (b) and (c), a Plan). 
General Fiduciary Matters  ERISA and the
Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an ERISA Plan) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or
other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders
investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA). 
In considering an investment in the notes with any portion of the assets of a Plan, a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan should consider, among other
matters, whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any applicable Similar Law relating to a fiduciarys duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. 
Prohibited Transaction Considerations 
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan
assets with persons or entities who are parties in interest, within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA, or disqualified persons, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative
exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person, including a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan, who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the
Code. Plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not
subject to the requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar prohibitions under other applicable Similar Laws. 
The acquisition and/or holding of the notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we, a guarantor or any of the underwriters of the
outstanding notes, or certain of our or their affiliates, are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code (or comparable provisions of Similar Laws), unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department
of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (PTCEs) that may apply to provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/ or holding of the notes. These class
exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 for transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 for transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 for transactions
involving bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 for transactions involving life insurance company general accounts and 
  S-93 


Table of Contents

PTCE 96-23 for transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an exemption from the prohibited
transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain purchases and sales of securities, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any
discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction, and provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no more, than adequate consideration in
connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.  Because
of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing plan assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code and will not constitute a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.  Representation 
Accordingly, by purchasing and holding notes, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that
either (i) it is not a Plan, and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the notes constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) neither the purchase nor the holding of the notes by such purchaser or subsequent
transferee will result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws. 
The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the
penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering whether to purchase the notes (or hold or dispose of the notes) on behalf of, or
with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transaction and whether an exemption would be applicable to such
transaction. Investors in the notes have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase of the notes does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or any similar provisions of Similar
Laws. The sale of any notes by or to any Plan is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by such Plans generally
or with respect to any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for such Plans generally or for any particular Plan.

 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the underwriting agreement, the underwriters have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the notes sold under the underwriting agreement if any of these notes are purchased. If an underwriter defaults, the underwriting agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting
underwriters may be increased or the underwriting agreement may be terminated.  We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters and their
controlling persons against certain liabilities in connection with this offering, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. 
The underwriters are offering the notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject to approval of legal
matters by their counsel, including the validity of the notes, and other conditions contained in the underwriting agreement, such as the receipt by the underwriters of officers certificates and legal opinions. The underwriters reserve the
right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part.  Commissions and Discounts 
The representatives have advised us that the underwriters propose initially to offer the notes to the public at the public offering price set
forth on the cover page of this prospectus supplement. After the initial offering, the public offering price, concession or any other term of the offering may be changed. The underwriters may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates.
 The following table shows the underwriting discounts and commissions per $1,000 principal amount of notes and the total underwriting

New Issue of Notes 
We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer
quotation system. We have been advised by the underwriters that they presently intend to make a market in the notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making
activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely
affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic
conditions and other factors.  No Sales of Similar Securities 
Each of Kennedy-Wilson Inc. and Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and the other guarantors has agreed that it will not, for a period of 90 days
after the date of this prospectus supplement, without first obtaining the prior written consent of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or
establish a put equivalent position (within the meaning of Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act), or otherwise dispose of, or announce the offering of, or file a registration statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any debt
securities of Kennedy-Wilson, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings or any other guarantor of the notes or securities exchangeable for or convertible into such debt securities, except as contemplated by the underwriting agreement. 
Short Positions  In connection with this
offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell the notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of
a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The underwriters must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are
concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. 
Similar to other purchase transactions, the underwriters purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or
maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. 
Neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the
transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation that the underwriters will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not
be discontinued without notice.  Electronic Distribution 
In connection with the offering, certain of the underwriters or securities dealers may distribute this prospectus supplement and the
accompanying prospectus by electronic means, such as email.  Other Relationships 
Affiliates of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and U.S.
Bancorp Investments, Inc. are lenders under our unsecured revolving credit facility and therefore will receive their pro rata share of the net proceeds of this offering that are used to repay a

portion of the outstanding loans under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Some of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking,
commercial lending and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. 
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities
may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the underwriters or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge, and certain other of the underwriters or their affiliates that have a
lending relationship with us may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of
either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
notes offered hereby. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients
that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.  Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area

C.
in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive, 
provided, that no such offer of notes referred to in (A) to (C) above shall result in a requirement for us or any representative to
publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive 
This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus have been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State will be

Directive in relation to such offer. Neither we nor the underwriters have authorized, nor do we or they authorize, the making of any offer of notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for us or the underwriters to publish a
prospectus for such offer.  For the purpose of this provision, the expression an offer of notes to the public in relation to
any notes in any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the notes, as the same
may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State, and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended) and includes any relevant implementing measure

management based on current estimates, expectations, forecasts and projections and include comments that express current opinions about trends and factors that may impact future operating results. Disclosures that use words such as
believe, anticipate, estimate, intend, could, plan, expect, project or the negative of these, as well as similar expressions, are intended to identify
forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, rely on a number of assumptions
concerning future events, many of which are outside of the issuers control, and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or achievement, or industry results, to differ materially from any
future results, performance or achievements, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although the issuers believe that their plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those
forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider the risks
referred to under the heading Risk Factors on page 1 of this prospectus, and in the reports Kennedy-Wilson Holdings files from time to time with the SEC and incorporates by reference herein, including, but not limited to, the following
factors:

disruptions in general economic and business conditions, particularly in geographies where the issuers respective businesses may be concentrated; 
 


 

 
the continued volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, higher interest rates, higher loan costs, less desirable loan terms and a reduction in the availability of mortgage loans and mezzanine
financing, all of which could increase costs and could limit the issuers ability to acquire additional real estate assets;   


 

 
continued high levels of, or increases in, unemployment and general slowdowns in commercial activity;   


 

 
the issuers leverage and ability to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness;   


 

 
an increase in the issuers debt service obligations;   


 

 
the issuers ability to generate a sufficient amount of cash from operations to satisfy working capital requirements and to service their existing and future indebtedness; 
 


 

 
the issuers ability to achieve improvements in operating efficiency;   


 

 
foreign currency fluctuations;   


 

 
adverse changes in the securities markets;   


 

 
the issuers ability to retain their senior management and attract and retain qualified and experienced employees;   


 

 
the issuers ability to attract new user and investor clients;   


 

 
the issuers ability to retain major clients and renew related contracts;   


 

 
trends in use of large, full-service commercial real estate providers;   


 

 
changes in tax laws in the United States, Europe or Japan that reduce or eliminate deductions or other tax benefits the issuers receive; 
 


 

 
future acquisitions may not be available at favorable prices or upon advantageous terms and conditions; and   


 

 
costs relating to the acquisition of assets the issuers may acquire could be higher than anticipated.

 The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed charges, as
defined. For this purpose, earnings consist of pretax income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interest and equity in income of joint ventures plus operating distributions from equity investees, and fixed
charges consists of interest expense, whether capitalized or expensed, amortization related to indebtedness and premiums or discounts of stock issuances and an estimate of interest expense within rental expense. For the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2009, and 2008, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges, and the deficiency of earnings was $6.5 million, $21.1 million and $9.5 million, respectively. 
The ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed
charges, as defined. For this purpose, earnings and fixed charges have the respective meanings assigned above. Preferred stock dividends refers to preferred dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries. For
the years ended December 31, 2011, 2009 and 2008, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, and the deficiency of earnings was $15.3 million, $21.1 million and $9.5 million,
respectively.

Table of Contents
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Our second amended and restated certificate of
incorporation authorizes the issuance of 125,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001. As of October 30, 2013, 81,413,679 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Holders of common stock have exclusive voting rights for the
election of our directors and all other matters requiring stockholder action, except with respect to amendments to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation that alter or change the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of
any outstanding preferred stock if the holders of such affected series of preferred stock are entitled to vote on such an amendment. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters to be voted on by stockholders and also are
entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion out of funds legally available therefor. The payment of dividends, if ever, on the common stock will be subject to
(i) the prior payment of dividends on any outstanding shares of preferred stock, and (ii) compliance with any applicable limitation in our debt agreements, including debt securities issued pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus
supplement. Our common stock has no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the common stock. 
Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors
being elected in each year. A plurality of the votes cast at a stockholders meeting is sufficient to elect any director into office. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  General. Our second amended and
restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share, or preferred stock. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that shares of
preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors is authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, the designations, powers, and preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights
and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions, applicable to the shares of each series of preferred stock. Our board of directors is able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could
adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control or the removal of existing management by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of the company or remove existing management. As of October 30,
2013, 100,000 shares of our series A preferred stock were issued and outstanding and 32,550 shares of our series B preferred stock were issued and outstanding. Other than the series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock, no shares
of preferred stock are currently outstanding.  The specific terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock will be
described in the prospectus supplement relating to that class or series, including a prospectus supplement providing that preferred stock may be issuable upon the exercise of warrants, or upon the conversion of any debt securities, that we issue
pursuant to this prospectus. The description of preferred stock set forth below and the description of the terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement do not purport to be complete and
are qualified in their entirety by reference to the articles supplementary relating to that class or series.  The preferences and other
terms of the preferred stock of each class or series will be fixed by the certificate of designation relating to such class or series. A prospectus supplement, relating to each class or series, will specify the terms of the preferred stock as
follows:   


 

 
the title and stated value of such preferred stock;   


 

 
the number of shares of such preferred stock offered, the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of such preferred stock; 
 


 

 
the dividend rate(s), period(s), and/or payment date(s) or method(s) of calculation thereof applicable to such preferred stock;

the relative ranking and preferences of such preferred stock as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of our company;

winding up of the affairs of our company;   


 

 
any voting rights of such preferred stock; and   


 

 
any other specific terms, preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions of such preferred stock. 
Rank. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the preferred stock will, with respect to dividend
rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, rank: (i) senior to all classes or series of our common stock, and to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking junior to the preferred
stock; (ii) on parity with any class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the preferred stock; and (iii) junior to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the
preferred stock.  Conversion Rights. The terms and conditions, if any, upon which any shares of any class or
series of preferred stock are convertible into our common stock will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement relating thereto. Such terms will include the number of shares of our common stock into which the shares of preferred stock are
convertible, the conversion price (or manner of calculation thereof), the conversion period, provisions as to whether conversion will be at the option of the holders of such class or series of preferred stock, the events requiring an adjustment of
the conversion price and provisions affecting conversion in the event of the redemption of such class or series of preferred stock. 
Power to Increase Authorized Stock and Issue Additional Shares of Our Preferred Stock. The number of authorized shares of
preferred stock may be increased by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of the capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the resolutions adopted by the board of directors for such series. Our board of directors has the
power to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of our preferred stock and thereafter to cause us to issue such classified or reclassified shares of stock. Although our
board of directors does not intend to do so, it could authorize us to issue a class or series that could, depending upon the terms of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that
might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interest.  Dividend
Limitations. The payment of dividends, if ever, on the preferred stock will be subject to compliance with any applicable limitations in our debt agreements, including debt securities issued pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus
supplement.   6.0% Convertible Series A Preferred Stock 
General. Our board of directors and a duly authorized committee thereof approved the certificate of designation, a copy of which
we have previously filed with the SEC and which we incorporate by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, creating the series A preferred stock as a class of our preferred stock, designated as the
6.0% convertible series A preferred stock. The outstanding series A preferred stock is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 
Ranking. The series A preferred stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up:

liquidation preference per share. Dividends on the series A preferred stock will accrue whether or not we have earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends. Our debt agreements, including debt
securities issued pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends on our preferred stock. 
Liquidation Preference. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up, holders of the series A preferred stock will have the right to
receive $1,000.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) up to and including the date of payment, before any payment is made to holders of our common stock and any other class or series of stock ranking
junior to the series A preferred stock as to liquidation rights. The rights of holders of series A preferred stock to receive their liquidation preference will be subject to the proportionate rights of any other class or series of our stock ranking
on parity with the series A preferred stock as to liquidation.  Optional Conversion and Mandatory Conversion.
Prior to May 19, 2015, each share of series A preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder at any time, into approximately 81 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustments under certain circumstances. On May 19, 2015,
each outstanding share of series A preferred stock will automatically be converted into shares of our common stock. 
Voting Rights. Holders of series A preferred stock generally have no voting rights. However, if we are in arrears on dividends
on the series A preferred stock for three or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of the series A preferred stock (voting together as a class with the holders of all other classes or series of parity preferred stock upon which
like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to vote at our next annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders for the election of two additional directors to serve on our board of directors until all unpaid
dividends and the dividend for the then-current period with respect to the series A preferred stock and any other class or series of parity preferred stock have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for
payment. In addition, we may not make certain material and adverse changes to the terms of the series A preferred stock without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of series A preferred stock and the
holders of all other shares of any class or series ranking on parity with the series A preferred stock that are entitled to similar voting rights (voting together as a single class).

securities issued pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends on our preferred stock. 
Liquidation Preference. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up, holders of the series B preferred stock will have the right
to receive $1,000.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) up to and including the date of payment, before any payment is made to holders of our common stock and any other class or series of stock ranking
junior to the series B preferred stock as to liquidation rights. The rights of holders of series B preferred stock to receive their liquidation preference will be subject to the proportionate rights of any other class or series of our
stock ranking on parity with the series B preferred stock as to liquidation.  Optional Conversion and Mandatory
Conversion. Prior to November 3, 2018, each share of series B preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder at any time, into approximately 93 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustments under certain
circumstances, or the series B conversion rate. At any time on or after May 3, 2017 and prior to November 3, 2018, we have the option to convert all or part of the outstanding shares of series B preferred stock into shares of
common stock at the series B conversion rate. On November 3, 2018, each outstanding share of series B preferred stock will automatically be converted into shares of our common stock at the series B conversion rate.
 Voting Rights. Holders of series B preferred stock generally have no voting rights. However, if we are in
arrears on dividends on the series B preferred stock for three or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of the series B preferred stock (voting together as a class with the holders of all other classes or series of
parity preferred stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to vote at our next annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders for the election of two additional directors to serve on our board
of directors until all unpaid dividends and the dividend for the then-current period with respect to the series B preferred stock and any other class or series of parity preferred stock have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof set aside for payment. In addition, we may not make certain material and adverse changes to the terms of the series B preferred stock without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares
of series B preferred stock and the holders of all other shares of any class or series ranking on parity with the series B preferred stock that are entitled to similar voting rights (voting together as a single class). 
Transfer Agent and Registrar. The transfer agent and registrar for our series B preferred stock is Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company.

base indenture. Information on material federal income tax considerations and other special considerations applicable to any of these new debt securities will be provided in the applicable

governmental charge payable in connection with a transfer or exchange may be required.  You may effect the transfer of certificated debt

restrictive covenants applicable to any issue of new debt securities will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.  No
Protection In the Event of a Change of Control  Unless stated otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the new debt

results in a change in control) that could adversely affect holders of new debt securities.  Consolidation, Merger and Sale of
Assets  The applicable issuer may not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all

expressly assumes the applicable issuers obligations on the new debt securities and under the applicable base indenture; and 
  21 


Table of Contents


 

 
immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing. 
Notwithstanding the above, any subsidiaries of the applicable issuer may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties to the applicable issuer.  Events of Default 
Event of Default means, with respect to any series of new debt securities, any of the following: 
 


 

 
a default in the payment of any interest upon any new debt security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days (unless the entire amount of the payment is
deposited by the applicable issuer with the trustee or with a paying agent prior to the expiration of the 30-day period);   


 

 
a default in the payment of principal of any security of that series at its maturity;   


 

 
a default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, if, when and as due by the terms of the new debt securities of that series, and the continuance of such default for a period of 60 days; 
 


 

 
a default in the performance or breach of any other covenant or warranty by the applicable issuer (or, in the case the new debt securities of that series are subject to a guarantee, the guarantor of such guarantee) in
the applicable base indenture (other than a covenant or warranty that has been included in the applicable base indenture solely for the benefit of a series of new debt securities other than that series), which default continues uncured for a period
of 60 days after the applicable issuer receives written notice from the trustee or the applicable issuer and the trustee receive written notice from the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that
series as provided in the applicable base indenture;   


 

 
if the new debt securities of such series are subject to a guarantee of a guarantor, such guarantee shall for any reason cease to be, or shall for any reason be asserted in writing by such guarantor or the applicable
issuer not to be, in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent contemplated or permitted by the applicable base indenture or the terms of the new debt securities of that series; 
 


 

 
certain voluntary or involuntary events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the applicable issuer; and   


 

 
any other Event of Default provided with respect to new debt securities of that series that is described in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
No Event of Default with respect to a particular series of new debt securities (except as to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization) necessarily constitutes an Event of Default with respect to any other series of new debt securities. The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration under the applicable base indenture may constitute an event of
default under certain other indebtedness of the applicable issuer or its subsidiaries outstanding from time to time.  If an Event of
Default with respect to new debt securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series may, by a
notice in writing to the applicable issuer (and to the trustee if given by the holders), declare to be due and payable immediately the principal of (or, if the new debt securities of that series are discount securities, that portion of the principal
amount as may be specified in the terms of that series), and any premium and accrued and unpaid interest on, all new debt securities of that series. In the case of an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, the principal (or such specified amount) of, and any premium and accrued and unpaid interest on, all outstanding new debt securities of the 
  22 


Table of Contents

applicable series will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of outstanding new debt securities. At any time
after a declaration of acceleration with respect to new debt securities of any series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding new debt securities of that series may rescind and annul the acceleration if all Events of Default (other than the non-payment of accelerated principal, premium and interest, if any, with respect to new debt securities of that series)
have been cured or waived as provided in the applicable base indenture. You are referred to the prospectus supplement relating to any series of new debt securities that are discount securities for the particular provisions relating to acceleration
of a portion of the principal amount of such discount securities upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.  The applicable base
indenture will provide that the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable base indenture unless the trustee receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any cost, liability or expense which
might be incurred by it in exercising such right of power. Subject to certain rights of the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of any series will have the right to direct the time, method
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to the new debt securities of that series. 
No holder of any new debt security of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the
applicable base indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy under the applicable base indenture, unless:   


 

 
that holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to new debt securities of that series; and 
 


 

 
the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity or security, to the trustee to institute the
proceeding as trustee, and the trustee has (x) not received from the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series a direction inconsistent with that request and (y) failed to
institute the proceeding within 60 days.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the applicable base indenture, the holder
of any new debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of, and any premium and interest on, that new debt security on or after the due dates expressed in that new debt security and to institute
suit for the enforcement of payment.  The applicable base indenture will require the applicable issuer to, within 120 days after the end
of its fiscal year, furnish to the trustee a statement as to compliance with the applicable base indenture. If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the securities of any series and is known to a responsible officer
of the trustee, then the trustee must mail to each holder of the securities of that series notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. The applicable base indenture will provide that the trustee may withhold notice to the
holders of new debt securities of any series of any Default or Event of Default (except in payment on any new debt securities of that series) with respect to new debt securities of that series if the trustee determines in good faith that withholding
notice is in the interest of the holders of those new debt securities.

modifications or amendments. However, no waiver or amendment may be made without the consent of the holders of each affected new debt security then outstanding if that waiver or amendment will: 
 


 

 
reduce the amount of new debt securities whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;   


 

 
reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any new debt security;   


 

 
reduce the principal of or premium, if any, on or change the fixed maturity of any new debt security or reduce the amount of, or postpone the date fixed for, the payment of any sinking fund or analogous obligation with
respect to any series of new debt securities;   


 

 
reduce the principal amount of discount securities payable upon acceleration of maturity;   


 

 
waive a default in the payment of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any new debt security (except a rescission of acceleration of the new debt securities of any series by the holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding new debt securities of that series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); 
 


 

 
make the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any new debt security payable in currency other than that stated in the new debt security; 
 


 

 
make any change to certain provisions of the applicable base indenture relating to, among other things, (i) the right of holders of new debt securities to receive payment of the principal of, or any premium or
interest on, new debt securities and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment; (ii) waivers of past defaults; and (iii) amendments and waivers that require the consent of each affected holder; 
 


 

 
waive a redemption payment with respect to any new debt security;   


 

 
in the case of any new debt security that is subject to a guarantee, release the guarantor of such guarantee from any of its obligations under such guarantee, except in accordance with the terms of the applicable base
indenture and such new debt security;   


 

 
make any change in the ranking or priority of any new debt security or any guarantee thereof that would adversely affect the holders of such new debt security; or 
 


 

 
in the case of any new debt security that provides that the holder thereof may require the applicable issuer to repurchase or convert such new debt security, impair such holders right to require such repurchase or
effect such conversion of such Security in accordance with the applicable base indenture and the terms of such new debt security. 
Except in certain circumstances, the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of any series
may on behalf of the holders of all new debt securities of that series waive compliance by the applicable issuer or any guarantor of new debt securities of that series with provisions of the 
  25 


Table of Contents

applicable base indenture or guarantee. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of any series may, on behalf of the holders of all the new debt
securities of such series, waive any past default under the applicable base indenture with respect to that series and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any new debt security of that
series. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of any series may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from the acceleration. 
Defeasance of New Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain Circumstances 
Legal Defeasance. The applicable base indenture will provide that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable
series of new debt securities, the applicable issuer and the guarantors, if any, will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the outstanding new debt securities of any series on the 123rd day after the date of the
deposit referred to below, and the provisions of the applicable base indenture, as it relates to such outstanding new debt securities of such series, will no longer be in effect, except as to certain specified rights, powers, immunities and
provisions. In order to effect such legal defeasance, the following conditions, among others, must be satisfied:   


 

 
subject to certain rights of the applicable issuer and guarantors, if any, the applicable issuer or, if applicable, any guarantor(s), must deposit, or cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the trustee money or U.S.
government obligations or, in the case of new debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest
and principal in accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of,
premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of all the new debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the applicable base indenture and those new debt
securities; and   


 

 
such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the applicable base indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the applicable issuer is a party or by which it is
bound;   


 

 
no default or Event of Default with respect to the new debt securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or during the period ending on the 123rd day after such date; and
  


 

 
the applicable issuer or guarantor(s) must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that the applicable issuer or guarantor(s), as applicable, have received from, or there has been published by, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service a ruling or, since the date of execution of the applicable base indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall
confirm that, the holders of the new debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and discharge and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred. 
Defeasance of Certain Covenants. The applicable base indenture will provide that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the
applicable series of new debt securities, upon compliance with certain conditions:   


 

 
the applicable issuer and, if applicable, may omit to comply with the covenant described under the heading Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets and certain other covenants set forth in the applicable
base indenture, as well as any additional covenants which may be described in the applicable prospectus supplement; and   


 

 
any omission to comply with those covenants, or with certain other Events of Default, will not constitute a default or an Event of Default with respect to the new debt securities of that series (covenant
defeasance). 
  26 


Table of Contents
The conditions include the following, among others: 
 


 

 
subject to certain rights of the applicable issuer and guarantors, if any, the applicable issuer or, if applicable, any guarantor(s), must deposit, or cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the trustee money or U.S.
government obligations or, in the case of new debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest
and principal in accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of,
premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of all the new debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the applicable base indenture and those new debt
securities; and   


 

 
the applicable issuer or guarantor(s) must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the new debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and related covenant defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit and related
covenant defeasance had not occurred.  Covenant Defeasance and Events of Default. In the event the
applicable issuer exercises its option to effect covenant defeasance with respect to any series of new debt securities, and the new debt securities of that series are declared due and payable immediately following an acceleration after the
occurrence of any Event of Default, the amount of money or U.S. government obligations or foreign government obligations on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient to pay amounts due on the new debt securities of that series at the time of their
stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the new debt securities of that series at the time of such acceleration. However, the applicable issuer shall remain liable for those payments. 
Governing Law  The
applicable base indenture and the new debt securities, including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the applicable base indenture or the securities, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the
conflicts of laws provisions thereof, other than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law).

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION 
The issuers may sell the securities domestically or abroad to one or more underwriters for public offering and sale by them or may sell the
securities to investors directly or through dealers or agents, or through a combination of methods. Any underwriter, dealer or agent involved in the offer and sale of the securities will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
Underwriters may offer and sell the securities at: (i) a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, (ii) market prices prevailing
at the time of sale, (iii) prices related to the prevailing market prices at the time of sale or (iv) negotiated prices. The issuers also may, from time to time, authorize underwriters acting as their agents to offer and sell the
securities upon the terms and conditions as are set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. In connection with the sale of securities, underwriters may be deemed to have received compensation from the applicable issuer in the form of
underwriting discounts or commissions and may also receive commissions from purchasers of securities for whom they may act as agent. Underwriters may sell securities to or through dealers, and the dealers may receive compensation in the form of
discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agent.  Any
underwriting compensation paid by an issuer to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers, will be set forth in the
applicable prospectus supplement. Dealers and agents participating in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on resale of the securities
may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. Underwriters, dealers and agents may be entitled, under agreements entered into with any of the issuers, to indemnification against and contribution toward civil
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Any indemnification agreement will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
Unless specified otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, any series of securities issued hereunder will be a new issue with no
established trading market (other than Kennedy-Wilson Holdings common stock, which is listed on the NYSE). If Kennedy-Wilson Holdings sells any shares of its common stock pursuant to a prospectus supplement, such shares will be listed on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. The issuers may elect to list any other securities issued hereunder on any exchange, but the issuers are not obligated to do so. Any underwriters or agents to or through whom such securities are sold for
public offering and sale may make a market in such securities, but such underwriters or agents will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the
trading market for any such securities.  If indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the issuers may authorize underwriters or
other persons acting as the issuers agents to solicit offers by institutions or other suitable purchasers to purchase the securities from the issuers at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement, pursuant to delayed
delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on the date or dates stated in the prospectus supplement. These purchasers may include, among others, commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and
educational and charitable institutions. Delayed delivery contracts will be subject to the condition that the purchase of the securities covered by the delayed delivery contracts will not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of any
jurisdiction in the United States to which the purchaser is subject. The underwriters and agents will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of these contracts. 
To facilitate the offering of the securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize,
maintain, or otherwise affect the price of the securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involves the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than the issuers sold to them. In these
circumstances, these persons would cover the over-allotments or 
  29 


Table of Contents

short positions by making purchases in the open market or by exercising their over-allotment option. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding
for or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization
transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be discontinued at any time. 
The underwriters, dealers and agents and their affiliates may be customers of, engage in transactions with and perform services for the
issuers in the ordinary course of business.  The specific plan of distribution, including any underwriters, dealers, agents or direct
purchasers and their compensation, will be identified in a prospectus supplement.
