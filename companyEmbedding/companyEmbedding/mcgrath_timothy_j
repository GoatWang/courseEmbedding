Timothy McGrath joined Southern Research in August 2016 as vice president of Drug Development. He leads teams of scientists that provide preclinical research and testing for government agencies and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in therapeutic areas such as infectious disease, CNS, and cancer. 
McGrath has more than 30 years of general management and global operations experience working in laboratory and commercial settings, most recently with North Carolina-based Q2 Solutions, a Quintiles/Quest Diagnostics joint venture, where he served as the global head of the company’s Bioanalytical and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) labs. Quintiles Transnational acquired the laboratory business of Advion Biosciences in 2011 – Bioanalytical and ADME Labs – which became part of Q2 Solutions in 2015.
McGrath’s career began in Massachusetts with the Foxboro Company, where he spent 18 years in commercial operations working his way up the ranks to ultimately serve as a global director, responsible for project support services for Foxboro’s Distributed Control Systems Division. In 1999, he left to join Biotage, LLC, in Charlottesville, Virginia.
At Biotage, McGrath served as vice president of operations where he helped grow the business 12-fold over six years before assisting the company leadership in selling Biotage to Pyrosequencing AB, in Upsala, Sweden. In 2006, McGrath joined Advion Biosciences in Ithaca, New York, as executive vice president of Operations to manage its product and lab divisions. This move launched the start of a new phase in McGrath’s career — one in which he spent the next decade leveraging his strengths in operations to help expand the size and capabilities of several highly scientific companies, product lines, and research-based teams.
McGrath earned a Bachelor of Science in business administration from the University of Massachusetts, North Dartmouth in 1981.
