Read below for a summary of the features and enhancements to our new site.
Featured Benefits
Recent Updates

A Refreshed Look & New Features for Janney Online Access
    Janney’s Online Access client portal has recently been refreshed. The navigation of the site has not changed, so you’ll still find your favorite features in the same place. We’ve also added the following new features:


Janney Money Transfer
    Janney Money Transfer lets you use Janney Online Access to transfer cash between your bank account and your Janney account, or between two Janney accounts. All it takes is a few clicks of a button. 

 Online Cash Transfer with Janney Money Transfer

 Responsive Mobile View

MY NET WORTH Account Aggregation
    With My Net Worth, Janney’s account aggregation feature, clients can now set budgets for expenses, track progress toward future goals, analyze cash flow into and out of accounts, and request transfers of outside assets into Janney. Now, My Net Worth is an even better tool for tracking your entire net worth in one place.

 MY NET WORTH Overview

eDelivery

 How to enroll in eDelivery

You can also add an enhanced level of security by always requiring a PIN code. These security measures are only used when an unrecognized computer attempts to logon to your accounts.

​​

 

Key Sections of the Site
Portfolio & Accounts – Your Portal to Account Management
 
In this section of the site, you’ll find detailed information about your holdings, including balances and positions, capital gains and losses, pending and completed transactions, and estimated income. Click through the second row of tabs for a detailed picture of your portfolio’s holdings and activity. Do you want to know how many municipal bonds or biotech stocks you hold in your portfolio? The Balances & Positions page lets you sort your assets by sector, security type, and symbol—and quantity, price, and value. Want to make sure a trade went through before you go to bed? Want to check how much you made on a stock sale? View the Account Activity page.
Summary Page

The Summary page is your go-to location for information about your accounts.  You can check highlights of information that appears elsewhere in more detail. This gives you the big picture of your Janney accounts— the cash, securities, and balance of each account linked to your online access.

 
Account Selector Tool
If you have a number of accounts (for example, one for each family member or education savings accounts for each child), use the Account Selector to choose only those accounts you want to see on your Accounts Overview – a big time-saver, especially if some of your accounts are more active than others. Your view will update to list only the accounts you selected.


Research & Education

The Research & Education tab opens a world of financial intelligence, updated every 20 minutes. Janney and S&P research and commentary can help you make confident, educated investment choices. If you want to research an industry, a company, or a security, you can sort information by markets, quotes, news updates, summaries of major market indices, and charts. Look up details of a particular stock, and track historical performance of a given security.

Here, you’ll also find targeted, objective research by Janney’s analysts on hundreds of companies. Read how the brightest financial minds expect the markets, as well as political and economic horizons, to evolve.
The Investor Education section features easy-to-read articles, links, and resources on financial topics— including retirement, college, taxes, personal finance, and estate planning.
