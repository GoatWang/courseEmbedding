Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Technology Select Sector Index (IXTTR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the technology sector which includes the following industries: computers and peripherals; software; diversified telecommunications services; communications equipment; semiconductors and semi-conductor equipment; internet software and services; IT services; electronic equipment, instruments and components; wireless telecommunication services; and office electronics. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:   CGI) today announced the sale of a tractor portfolio and minority investment in a tractor financing joint venture to support its Quality Companies business. 
Celadon Chairman and CEO, Paul Will, commented:  "At Celadon, we continue to seek growth opportunities that diversify our income streams, participate in rapidly growing and defensible markets and improve our return on capital.  I am pleased to announce another important step in this direction through a portfolio sale and financing joint venture to support the growth of our Quality Companies subsidiaries.  We recently completed the initial sale of an approximately $13.6 million portfolio of tractors and the associated leases to 19th Capital Group LLC, and additional portfolio sales are expected to take place in the future.  We also made a minority investment in 19th Capital Group, which also included management participation, which we expect to report under the equity method of accounting.  We believe these transactions will afford us an opportunity to grow the Quality Companies' business in markets where we currently have limited access due to financing constraints, participate in the economics of the lease stream and residual value of the tractors and improve our return on invested capital compared with retaining the portfolio on the balance sheet.  We look forward to accelerating the growth of our Quality Companies business unit with our new capital partner."
Quality Companies Business
Will continued:  "Over the past two fiscal years, our Quality Companies unit has grown tractors under management to approximately 4,900 on June 30, 2015, from approximately 750 on June 30, 2013.  Substantially all of these tractors have been purchased by us on favorable terms through our consolidated buying power.  The tractors are then sold to a third party financing company, who then leases them to independent contractors who provide capacity to us and other trucking companies.
"Under the historical servicing arrangement with our financial partner, Quality Companies provides driver recruiting, lease payment remittance, insurance, maintenance and other services for a fee.  Celadon is not a guarantor of such financing or the leases, and we do not share in the profit or loss from the lease revenue stream or the residual value of the tractor assets. The assets and debt associated with these tractors are not included in our consolidated balance sheets.  In addition, Quality currently has approximately 13,000 tractors on order from several different manufacturers, scheduled to be delivered over the next three years.
"We have identified the growth of Quality Companies as a strategic priority for several reasons.  First, we believe the market for tractors under management is growing faster than the general truckload freight market.  Second, our consolidated buying power, warranty plans, maintenance experience and insurance expertise should provide a differentiated services suite to independent contractors and third-party fleets that may not have the capacity or desire to build these skill sets internally.  Third, the Quality Companies business, to the extent pursued off-balance sheet with financial partners, has the prospect for more consistent margins, lower capital expenditures and higher return on invested capital than our traditional truckload business.  Fourth, we believe we are able to access an entrepreneurial and high-performing segment of the professional truck driving population that otherwise may go unserved generally or untapped by us.
"The historical arrangement with our financial partner has been positive, and we expect it to continue.  However, due to the significant growth of Quality and with the additional capacity needed to grow fully with Quality Companies, we believe it is in our best interest to diversify our sources of growth capital and encourage competitive terms.  Accordingly, we have been seeking additional financial partners."
Financing Joint Venture
Will commented on 19th Capital Group: "We are fortunate to do business again with Larsen MacColl Partners and its affiliates ("LMP").  LMP was the controlling shareholder of A&S Kinard before our acquisition of that successful business.  After reviewing multiple proposals for financing the Quality Companies fleet business, most of which would have required direct or indirect credit support from us, and resulting balance sheet consolidation, LMP proposed a similar joint venture, but with additional economic opportunity for us.  The joint venture, called 19th Capital Group, is controlled by LMP with a minority investment by Celadon and Celadon management.  The structure is expected to allow us to account for the investment under the equity method of accounting.  In addition, with this investment, we will record a share of the joint venture's profit or loss on the lease income stream and residual sale value of the tractors, which we currently do not share in under the contract with our current financing partner. "
Tractor Portfolio Sale
Will addressed the portfolio sale:  "We sold a portfolio to 19th Capital Group for approximately $13.6 million.  In addition, we agreed to provide certain driver recruiting, lease payment remittance, maintenance and insurance services under related agreements. We anticipate additional sales to 19th Capital Group in the future.  The services and terms of these services are similar to those provided to our current financing partner."

Theranos Wants Class Limited To Indirect Share Purchasers



        By Dani Kass



					Law360, New York (July 3, 2017,  5:22 PM EDT) -- Theranos Inc. has urged a California federal court to exclude investors that directly bought shares from a proposed class of indirect share purchasers bringing securities fraud claims, saying only the former are bound by a contract.The embattled startup said on Friday the shareholders it's challenging are contractually obligated through investor rights and stock purchase agreements to sue in Delaware, avoid jury trials and shift attorneys’ fees to the winning party. The indirect share purchasers aren’t facing the same limitations and have filed their suit in California, highlighting the...

SAN FRANCISCO, April 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP alerts investors in Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:    CGI) to the firm's investigation into possible accounting irregularities and securities law violations.
If you purchased or otherwise acquired securities of CGI before April 5, 2017 and suffered losses contact Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP.  For more information visit:








https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/CGI 
or contact Reed Kathrein, who is leading the firm's investigation, by calling 510-725-3000 or emailing CGI@hbsslaw.com.
On April 5, 2017, SeekingAlpha published a report by Prescience Point Research Group entitled, "Celadon Group: A Story That Ends At Chapter 11."  The report highlighted several aspects of CGI's financial reporting that Prescience Point believed constituted improper accounting.  In response to this publication, the price of CGI's shares fell approximately 13.6% to close at $5.40 on April 5, 2017.
"We're focused on the accounting-related matters highlighted within the Prescience Point report, those highlighted in previous adverse research reports, and whether there will be a restatement of historical financial reports," said Hagens Berman partner Reed Kathrein.
Whistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding CGI should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.  Under the new SEC whistleblower program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC. For more information, call Reed Kathrein at 510-725-3000 or email CGI@hbsslaw.com.
About Hagens BermanHagens Berman is a national investor-rights law firm headquartered in Seattle, Washington with offices in 10 cities.  The Firm represents investors, whistleblowers, workers and consumers in complex litigation.
