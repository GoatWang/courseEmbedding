Description










Features

This popular model can operate a wide variety of appliances, making it perfect for portable use at home, camping, on the jobsite, or much more. Reliable Power is now at your fingertips with Honda's Inverted Generators.
So quiet, your neighbors will thank you. The EU2000i operates at 53 to 59 dBA, which is less noise than a normal conversation. This makes it ideal for camping, supplemental RV power and any other activity that requires quiet operation.
Need more power? Add a second EU2000i for additional power. Two identical models can be paralleled with an optional cable or cord for up to 4000 watts of power, or time consuming applications.
Thanks to our exclusive Eco-Throttle System, the EU2000i offers great fuel efficiency. Runs 4.0 to 9.6 hours on a single tank, depending on the load. This makes it the ideal choice for overnight power, or long time applications.
Honda's inverter technology means stable, clean power in a smaller, lighter package. The precision of Honda's inverter technology ensures our inverter generators produce power that is as reliable as the power you get from your outlets at home.
Weighing less than 47 pounds, the EU2000 is incredibly lightweight and portable, thanks to Honda's inverter technology.
Use the Generator with confidence! You may rest easy knowing your generator is covered from top to bottom for up to 3 full years. Work Hard, and Play even Harder.
Use when charging 12-volt automotive type batteries. (Requires an optional charging cord.)

                            Comment:                    

                        I've had 5 generators before I bought this one. For sure its the quietest and easiest to start. I'm 72 years old and do not pull the others as fast as needed to get a spark. So far very dependable and neighbor friendly.

                        Great Generator, Great Price!
Fast shipping, excellent customer service.
Thanks again

Great Generator 




                            Comment:                    

                        I have several other types of generators, but the Honda is by far the best. Quiet, and very easy on gas.

Best little generators ever created! Best Distributor hands down!




                            Comment:                    

                        This Honda EU2000i is my second. The first was stolen after 6 years of trust worthy service. It was perfect right out of the box. Just add gas and oil. Started first try. Electric Generator Depot had the best price and most reliable sales and shipping nationwide. Beat all of our local distributors here in Hawaii. Thanks for making it easy and keeping the price reasonable!

EXCELLENT PRICE AND VALUE!




                            Comment:                    

                        Great service, shipping and value; excellent product. Ran for about 7 hours on one small tank of gas in 95 degree/75 % humidity and fans kept my pups nice and cool!  Love this machine!

                        This is the second eu2000i I have bought from Electric Generator Depot. Fast service, best prices, quick shipping--in all, the best of all worlds. The Hondas are quiet and fuel efficient. It has enough power for any hand power tool. It can be toted around easily even paired with another eu2000i. The only complaint is fuel problems related to gumming carbs. Do not store yours for over 2 months with fuel. It is easy to drain. Try to find fuel without ethanol. It is now sold in most big box stores. I have spent much time cleaning carbs and being in situations where the Honda didn't start and I was stuck without electricity. Talk to most dealerships this is a common $125.00 non warranty service.

HONDA IS THE ONE AND ONLY ONE




                            Comment:                    

                        Waited until now to give my Honda EU2000i generator a good work out that I bought back in November 2015. Very pleased with this generator. I made a big mistake in buying one of those cheaper Chinese made generators back in 2014. Would not start for me on 2015 and I had less than 25 hours on it. LEARNED MY LESSON THE HARD WAY.

Great price and fast deliver




                            Comment:                    

                        I have several friends who use a Honda EU2000i while houseboating, so I already knew of the quiet and dependable operation these machines offer.  EGD certainly had the best price with free shipping and the delivery time was faster than expected.

Nothing like a Honda




                            Comment:                    

                        Filled it with oil and gas on 3 pull started right up. After break in starts right up on first or second pull.

Nothing as good as a Honda with these inverter types.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
