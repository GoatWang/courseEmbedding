					Full Description



Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd., incorporated on September 2, 2008, utilizes a compressed air energy storage power generation technology that can store energy for other alternative energy sources, such as using solar, wind, geothermal and tidal as raw power to regenerate electricity power without the use of fossil fuels or other chemical methods. The Company is engaged in research, development, production, marketing and sales. The Company's geographic segment is China. The Company's focus is on industrial users. As of July 31, 2016, the Company's projects included an installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels in conjunction with its compressed air energy storage technology and consisted of an installation at a factory in Shandong Province with a capacity of nine megawatts, and a power plant in Hubei Province with a capacity of six megawatts.The Company has developed two smaller projects in Shandong Province using PV panels without air compression technology. The Company is also developing smaller compressed air energy storage power generation equipment for use with PV that will be useful for smaller commercial buildings and private homes. The Company produces its systems in China primarily for Chinese customers and is exploring foreign markets. As of July 31, 2016, the Company had a distribution network of third-party distributors and sales agencies in 24 provinces in China. The Company's principal product is a system that combines the air compression power generation systems with a PV installation that is custom designed for industrial users, such as factories and power plants. The Company also offers PV systems without the air compression generation technology. The air compression power generation systems can be used with multiple forms of natural energy production, including solar, wind, biomass, geothermal and tidal and the selection of the appropriate natural source depends on their relative availability at the customer's location.The Company sells the PV installation that includes the solar panels installation and solar energy generation converter equipment with technology without the air compression for customers that do not need to store energy. The Company's air compression energy storage generation technology is also designed for customers whose alternative energy source provides intermittent or unstable power. The systems are sold in conjunction with a PV installation. A portion of the electricity produced by the PV panels is used to compress air into the cylinders, which store the energy until it is released. The system includes compression equipment, storage tanks and a modified engine that is linked to a generator. The surplus power generated by the air compression technology may either be used by the customer it its operations or sold to the National Grid.The Company competes with Yingli Green Energy.

	Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd.





	Notes to
	Consolidated Financial Statements



	(Unaudited)




	NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS



	Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd. (the Company) was
	incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 2, 2008 as Goa Sweet Tours
	Ltd. The Company was originally formed to provide personalized concierge tour
	packages to tourists who visit the State of Goa, India. On April 17, 2012, the
	Company entered into Share Purchase Agreements, by and among, Luck Sky
	International Investment Holdings Limited (Luck Sky), an entity owned and
	controlled by Zhou Deng Rong, and certain of our former stockholders who owned,
	in the aggregate, 7,200,000 shares of the Companys common stock (90% of the
	then outstanding shares). Luck Sky purchased all 7,200,000 shares for an
	aggregate of $235,000. The sale was completed on May 15, 2012.


	On May 25, 2012, the Company formed a corporation under the
	laws of the State of Delaware called Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd.
	("Merger Sub") and on the same day, acquired one hundred shares of Merger Sub's
	common stock for cash. As such, Merger Sub became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
	the Company.


	Effective as of May 29, 2012, Merger Sub was merged with and
	into the Company. As a result of the merger, the Companys name was changed to
	Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd.. Prior to the merger, Merger Sub had no
	liabilities and nominal assets and, as a result of the merger, the separate
	existence of the Merger Sub ceased. The Company was the surviving corporation in
	the merger and, except for the name change provided for in the Agreement and
	Plan of Merger, there was no change in the directors, officers, capital
	structure or business of the Company.



	Merger with LuckSky (Hong Kong) Shares Limited



	On September 5, 2013, the Company entered into a business
	combination by means of merger of LuckSky (Hong Kong) Shares Limited (HK
	Shares), a Hong Kong corporation, for 250,000,000 shares of common stock of the
	Company. Prior to the merger, HK Shares had no liabilities and nominal assets.
	On September 23, 2013, the Company issued 250,000,000 shares of common stock to
	the shareholders of HK Shares. Effectively on September 24, 2013, the
	shareholders of HK Shares accepted the shares from the Company and surrendered
	its control of HK Shares to the Company in exchange of 250,000,000 shares of HK
	Shares to be issued to its shareholders. On October 16, 2013, HK Shares
	completed the issuance of its 250,000,000 shares accordingly. Management
	cancelled HK Shares in October 2014.



	Acquisition of Sanhe City Lucksky Electrical Engineering
	Co., Ltd.



	On July 25, 2014, Luck Sky (Shen Zhen) Aerodynamic Electricity
	Limited (Luck Sky Shen Zhen), a corporation incorporated under the laws of the
	People Republic of China (PRC), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary; Sanhe
	City Lucksky Electrical Engineering Co., Ltd. (Sanhe), a corporation
	incorporated under the laws of the PRC; and Mr. Zhou Jian and Mr. Zhou Deng
	Rong, the owners of 97% and 3%, respectively, of Sanhe; entered into a series of
	agreements known as variable interest agreements (the VIE Agreements) pursuant
	to which Sanhe became Luck Sky Shen Zhens contractually controlled affiliate.
	The purpose and effect of the VIE Agreements is to provide Luck Sky Shen Zhen
	(our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary) with all of the management, control and
	net profits of Sanhe.


	7







	Simultaneously, the Company entered into a common stock
	purchase agreement with Zhou Jian and Zhou Deng Rong, the owners of 97% and 3%,
	respectively, of Sanhe, in consideration for the execution of the VIE Agreements
	and the acquisition of Sanhe. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the
	Company issued Zhou Jian and Zhou Deng Rong 264,850,740 and 8,191,260 shares,
	respectively, of our common stock, representing 51.4% of our issued and
	outstanding shares of common stock.



	Reincorporation in Nevada



	We reincorporated in Nevada effective October 31, 2016 as a
	result of a merger of Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd., a Delaware
	corporation, with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co.,
	Ltd., a Nevada corporation.



	NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	Basis of Presentation



	The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
	prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
	United States of America. This basis of accounting involves the application of
	accrual accounting and consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when
	earned, and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred. The Companys
	consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars.



	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
	make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
	contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
	the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.



	Interim Financial Statements



	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been
	prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
	applicable to interim financial information and the requirements of Form 10-Q
	and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
	Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosure required
	by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
	complete financial statements. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
	results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
	considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the
	results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been included.
	These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
	audited financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2016, as not all
	disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual
	financial statements are presented. The interim financial statements follow the
	same accounting policies and methods of computations as the audited financial
	statements for the year ended July 31, 2016.


	These interim financial statements should be read in
	conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended July 31,
	2016, as not all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
	principles for annual financial statements are presented. The interim financial
	statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of computations as
	the audited financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2016.

	Reclassification



	Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have
	been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These
	reclassifications had no effect on reported net income or losses.



	Principle of Consolidation



	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
	the Company, its subsidiaries and VIE for which it is deemed the primary
	beneficiary. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been
	eliminated in consolidation.


	The Company evaluates the need to consolidate its VIE in which
	equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial
	interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
	activities without additional subordinated financial support.


	The VIE agreement was not consummated until July 25, 2014,
	however, the purpose and design of the establishment of VIE, Sanhe, was to
	consolidate common control under the Company. ASC 810-10-25-38F states that a
	reporting entitys involvement in the design of a VIE may indicate that the
	reporting entity had the opportunity and the incentive to establish arrangements
	that result in the reporting entity being the variable interest holder with the
	power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic
	performance. As both the Company and the acquired VIE, Sanhe, are under the
	common control of Zhou Dengrong and Zhou Jian immediately before and after the
	acquisition, this transaction was accounted for as a merger under common
	control, using merger accounting as if the merger had been consummated at the
	beginning of the earliest period presented, and no gain or loss was recognized.
	All the assets and liabilities of the VIE, Sanhe, are recorded at carrying
	value. Hence, Sanhe was consolidated under the Company since its inception due
	to the purpose and design of its establishment.


	The following financial statement amounts and balances of the
	VIE, which is established on August 6, 2014, were included in the accompanying
	consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016 and
	for the three months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively:

	Fair Value Measurements



	The Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10,
	Fair Value Measurements, for fair value measurements of financial assets and
	financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that
	are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements. ASC 820
	also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
	about fair value measurements.


	9







	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
	sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
	market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and
	liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company
	considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact
	and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the
	asset or liability.


	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an
	entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
	unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels
	of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
	highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
	assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to
	measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:


	[  ]     Level 1 inputs to the
	valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or
	liabilities in active markets.


	[  ]     Level 2 inputs to the
	valuation methodology includes quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
	in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability,
	either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
	instruments.


	[  ]     Level 3 inputs to the
	valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.


	There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a
	recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of January
	31, 2017 and July 31, 2016.



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
	original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
	equivalents.



	Inventory



	Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
	principally determined using the weighted average basis. Construction costs
	incurred on contracts are included in inventories which consist of raw
	materials, accessory parts, and contracts work in progress.



	Property and equipment



	Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
	depreciation and impairment losses. Gains or losses on dispositions of property
	and equipment are included in operating income (loss). Major additions, renewals
	and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as
	incurred.


	Depreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated
	useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method from the time the
	assets are placed in service. Estimated useful lives are as follows, taking into
	account the assets' estimated residual value:

	Revenue Recognition



	Sales of power generation system in conjunction of system
	installation are recognized under accounting for construction-type contracts,
	based on the nature of the contract using the


	Completed-Contract Method.


	The reason for selecting completed-contract method is (a) The
	Companys contract is duration is less than one year and financial position and
	results of operations would not vary materially from those resulting from use of
	the percentage-of completion method. (b) Reasonably dependable estimate cannot
	be made due to nature of contracts. Accordingly, revenue is recognized upon the
	completion of the construction, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement
	exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the fee is fixed and
	determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We provide for any loss that
	we expect to incur on these contracts when that loss is probable.


	Percentage-of Completion Method


	For contracts with long duration and it is practical to make
	reasonable estimate, percentage-of completion method is used. Revenue is
	recognized based on the percentage of total income. The percentage is based on
	incurred costs to date bearing to estimate total cost after giving effect to
	estimates of cost to complete based on most recent information. We provide for
	any loss that we expect to incur on these contracts when that loss is
	probable.



	Warranty and Returns



	The Company generally provides limited warranties for work
	performed under its contracts. The warranty periods typically extend for a
	limited duration following substantial completion of the Company's work on a
	project. At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty
	costs. Such estimated costs for warranties are included in the individual
	project cost estimates for purposes of accounting for long-term contracts.
	Generally, the estimated claim rates of warranty are based on actual warranty
	experience or Companys best estimate.


	No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Replacement
	part returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized.



	Value added taxes



	The Company is subject to VAT at a rate of 17% on proceeds
	received from customers, and are entitled to a refund for VAT already paid or
	borne on the goods purchased by it that have generated the gross sales proceeds.
	The VAT balance is recorded in other payables on the balance sheets.



	Income Taxes



	The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and
	liability approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of deferred
	tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future
	years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for
	the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
	assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
	income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets
	if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company
	is able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is
	uncertain.


	11







	Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only
	if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a
	tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The evaluation
	of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether
	it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon
	examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigations
	based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a
	tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the
	amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position
	is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent
	likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously
	failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be
	recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met.
	Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not
	criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting
	period in which the threshold is no longer met. Penalties and interest incurred
	related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in
	the year incurred. No significant penalties or interest relating to income taxes
	have been incurred during the period from July 8, 2013 (inception) to December
	31, 2013. US GAAP also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
	interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and
	transition.



	Comprehensive Loss



	The Company follows the provisions of the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (the FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 220
	Reporting Comprehensive Income, and establishes standards for the reporting
	and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances in
	a full set of general purpose financial statements.



	Foreign Currency Translation



	The Companys functional currency is Chinese Renminbi (RMB)
	as substantially all of the Companys PRC subsidiaries operations use this
	denomination. The consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.
	dollars. Foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into
	their United States dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which
	prevailed at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are
	translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Revenues
	and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year. Gains
	or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in results
	of operations.


	For the purpose of presenting these financial statements of
	subsidiaries in PRC, the Companys assets and liabilities are expressed in US$
	at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, which is 6.8768 and 6.6371 as of
	January 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016, respectively; stockholders equity accounts
	are translated at historical rates, and income and expense items are translated
	at the weighted average exchange rate during the period, which is 6.7790 and
	6.4054 for the six months ended January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016. The
	resulting translation adjustments are reported under accumulated other
	comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the balance
	sheets.


	12







	For the purpose of presenting these financial statements of
	subsidiaries in Hong Kong, PRC, the Companys assets and liabilities are
	expressed in US$ at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, which is 7.7579
	and 7.7588 as of January 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016, respectively; stockholders
	equity accounts are translated at historical rates, and income and expense items
	are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period, which is
	7.7567 and 7.7555 the six months ended January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016,
	respectively. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under
	accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of
	the balance sheets.



	Earnings (Loss) per Share



	Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income
	available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
	outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive
	securities. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all dilutive potential of
	shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock options or
	warrants, using the treasury stock method (by using the average stock price for
	the period to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the
	exercise of stock options or warrants), and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock,
	using the if-converted method. Earnings per share excludes all potential
	dilutive shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no
	potential dilutive securities at January 31, 2017 or January 31, 2016.



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the
	Measurement of Inventory, which modifies existing requirements regarding
	measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under existing standards,
	the market amount requires consideration of replacement cost, net realizable
	value (NRV), and NRV less an approximately normal profit margin. The new ASU
	replaces market with NRV, defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary
	course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal
	and transportation. This eliminates the need to determine and consider
	replacement cost or NRV less an approximately normal profit margin when
	measuring inventory. The amendments are effective for the annual period ending
	after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early
	application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing this ASUs impacts
	on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition.


	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
	ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic
	205-40). This standard is intended to define managements responsibility to
	evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to
	continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The
	amendments contained in this ASU apply to all companies and not-for-profit
	organizations. The amendments are effective for the annual period ending after
	December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early
	application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing this ASUs impact
	on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition.


	The Company believes that there were no other accounting
	standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on
	our financial position or results of operations.



	NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN



	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
	prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has
	incurred losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of
	$1,784,876 as of January 31, 2017 and further losses are anticipated in the
	development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Companys
	ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going
	concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the
	future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and
	repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become
	due. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to
	the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and
	classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
	unable to continue as a going concern.


	13







	The Company expects to finance operations primarily through
	cash flow from revenue and capital contributions from principal shareholders. In
	the event that we require additional funding to finance the growth of the
	Companys current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our
	strategic objectives, our principal shareholders have indicated the intent and
	ability to provide additional equity financing.


	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys
	ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys continuation as a going
	concern is dependent on our ability to meet obligations as they become due and
	to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required to fund operations
	until sufficient sources of recurring revenues can be generated. There can be no
	assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans described above or in
	attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all.
	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
	the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Sanhe leases its principal office, factory and dormitory from
	LuckSky Group in Sanhe City, Hebei Province. LuckSky Group is owned by Zhou Deng
	Rong, our former CEO and Zhou Jian, our General Manager and Chairman of the
	Board. The space in the office, factory and dormitory being leased are 1296,
	5160 and 1200 square meters, respectively. The office and factory space are
	leased for a rent of $102,855 (RMB 697,248) per year and the dormitory is leased
	for a rent of $19,118 (RMB 129,600) per year. The leases expire in April 30,
	2024 and are subject to renewal with a prior two-month written notice. LuckSky
	Group is in the process of obtaining the land use approval and ownership
	certificate of the leased building. As of January 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016,
	the lease payables to LuckSky Group were $330,653 and $280,304, respectively.


	Until August 1, 2015, Sanhe leased a second factory and office
	in Sanhe City from Sanhe Dong Yi Glass Machine Company Limited, which is owned
	by Zhou Deng Rong. A portion of this facility was used by Sanhe to demonstrate
	its products but the facility was primarily intended as a backup to the first
	facility in Sanhe City and/or for expansion. The factory and office are 4,748.96
	square meters. The rent paid by Sanhe for the factory and the office was RMB1,
	306,500 per year. As of January 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016, the rental fee
	accrued but unpaid under the leases from LuckSky Group and Sanhe Dong Yi were
	$237,483 and $246,060, respectively. On August 1, 2015, the two parties
	terminated the finance leasing. As the Company no longer needs the factory and
	office, the assets were returned to the lessor effective August 1, 2015.


	On July 27, 2016, Xianning Xiangtian Air Energy Electric Co.,
	Ltd. (Xianning Xiangtian), the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered

	Due to Directors



	From time to time, the Company receives advances from its
	directors. As of January 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016, the Company received
	$416,040 and $414,876, respectively. The Company used the funds for its
	operations. These advances are due on demand, unsecured and non-interest
	bearing.



	Due to Shareholders



	From time to time, the Company receives advances from its
	shareholder, Zhou Dengrong. As of January 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016, the
	Company received $84,342 and $0, respectively. The Company used the funds for
	its operations. These advances are due on demand, unsecured and non-interest
	bearing.



	NOTE 8 -GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN



	The Company participates in a government-mandated
	multi-employer defined contribution plan pursuant to which certain retirement,
	medical and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese labor
	regulations require the Company to pay to the local labor bureau a monthly
	contribution at a stated contribution rate based on the monthly basic
	compensation of qualified employees. The relevant local labor bureau is
	responsible for meeting all retirement benefit obligations; the Company has no
	further commitments beyond its monthly contribution.


	The outstanding amount was $108,402 and $92,134 as of January
	31, 2017 and July 31, 2016, respectively.



	NOTE 9 - STATUTORY RESERVE



	Pursuant to the laws applicable to the PRC, PRC entities must
	make appropriations from after-tax profit to the non-distributable statutory
	surplus reserve fund. Subject to certain cumulative limits, the statutory
	surplus reserve fund requires annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax profit
	until the aggregated appropriations reach 50% of the registered capital (as
	determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the PRC ("PRC
	GAAP") at each year-end). For foreign invested enterprises and joint ventures in
	the PRC, annual appropriations should be made to the reserve fund. For foreign
	invested enterprises, the annual appropriation for the reserve fund cannot be
	less than 10% of after-tax profits until the aggregated appropriations reach 50%
	of the registered capital (as determined under PRC GAAP at each year-end). If
	the Company has accumulated loss from prior periods, the Company is able to use
	the current period net income after tax to offset against the accumulate
	loss.



	NOTE 10 - CAPITAL STOCK AND EQUITY TRANSACTIONS




	Common Stock



	The total number of common shares authorized that may be issued
	by the Company is 1,000,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001 per share.


	During the period ended July 31, 2009, the Company issued
	5,000,000 shares of common stock for total cash proceeds of $25,000 to the
	Companys sole director and officer. During the year ended July 31, 2010, the
	Company sold 3,000,000 shares of common stock for total cash proceeds of
	$30,000.


	On September 23, 2013, the Company issued 250,000,000 shares of
	common stock to the shareholders of HK Shares, in exchange of 250,000,000 shares
	of HK Shares.


	On September 23, 2013, the Company issued a total of 67,000,000
	shares of restricted common stock at $0.001 per share, such that 60,000,000
	shares were issued to Mr. Roy Thomas Phillips, who was then a consultant to the
	Company and later served as the acting CFO of the Company beginning July 29,
	2014, and 7,000,000 shares were issued to two other non-related parties. The shares were issued in contemplation of a secondary offering.
	The Company takes the position that these shares should be cancelled since no
	secondary offering was consummated. The Company is taking steps to have these
	shares canceled. The Company valued the 67,000,000 shares of common stock issued
	at $67,000 as there was no market for the Companys common stock and it has
	limited or no trading; and these shares are s thought to be of minimal value to
	the Company at the time of issuance, therefore the par value is thought to match
	the assumed book value of the Companys common stock which is at $0.001 per
	share. On July 24, 2015, 7,000,000 shares issued to two other non-related
	parties were cancelled.

	On July 25, 2014, we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement
	in connection with the acquisition of Sanhe with Zhou Jian and Zhou Deng Rong,
	the owners of 97% and 3%, respectively, of Sanhe. We agreed to issue to Zhou
	Jian and Zhou Deng Rong 264,850,740 and 8,191,260 shares, respectively, of our
	common stock, representing 51.4% of our issued and outstanding shares of common
	stock.



	Preferred Stock



	The total number of preferred shares authorized that may be
	issued by the Company is 100,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001 per
	share. The preferred shares may be issued in one or more series, from time to
	time, with each series to have such designation, relative rights, preference or
	limitations, as adopted by the Companys Board of Directors. No preferred shares
	have been issued.





	NOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES




	United States



	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
	differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
	reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The cumulative tax effect at the expected
	rate of 34% of significant items comprising the net deferred tax amount is at

	As of January 31, 2017, for U.S. federal income tax reporting
	purposes, the Company has approximately $965,518 of unused net operating losses
	(NOLs) available for carry forward to future years. The benefit from the carry
	forward of such NOLs will begin expiring during the year ended July 31, 2029.
	Because United States tax laws limit the time during which NOL carry forwards
	may be applied against future taxable income, the Company may be unable to take
	full advantage of its NOLs for federal income tax purposes should the Company
	generate taxable income. Further, the benefit from utilization of NOL carry
	forwards could be subject to limitations due to material ownership changes that
	could occur in the Company as it continues to raise additional capital. Based on
	such limitations, the Company has significant NOLs for which realization of tax
	benefits is uncertain.

	Hong Kong



	The Companys subsidiaries established in HKSAR are subject to
	Hong Kong Profits Tax. However, these subsidiaries did not earn any income
	derived in Hong Kong from its date of incorporation to January 31, 2017, and
	therefore were not subject to Hong Kong Profits Tax.

	Rental expense of the Company for the six months ended January
	31, 2017 and 2016 were $101,948 and $64,543, respectively.



	Credit risk



	Cash deposits with banks are held in financial institutions in
	China, which are not federally insured deposit protection. Accordingly, the
	Company has a concentration of credit risk related to these uninsured bank
	deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and
	believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk in this area.

	Contingencies



	On September 23, 2013, the Company issued 60,000,000 shares of
	restricted common stock at $0.001 per share to Mr. Roy Thomas Phillips, who was
	then a consultant to the Company and later served as the acting CFO of the
	Company beginning July 29, 2014, and two other non-related parties, obtained a
	total of 7,000,000 shares of restricted common stock. The shares were issued in
	contemplation of a secondary offering. The Company takes the position that these
	shares should be cancelled since no secondary offering was consummated. The
	Company is taking steps to have these shares canceled. The Company valued the
	67,000,000 shares of common stock issued at $67,000 as there was no market for
	the Companys common stock and it has limited or no trading; and there is
	thought to be minimal value in the Company at the time of issuance, therefore
	the par value is thought to match the assumed market price of the Companys
	common stock which is at $0.001 per share. The issuance of these securities
	could result in further dilution to the Companys stockholders which effects the
	earnings (loss) per share amount of the Company. The Company might incur
	additional expenses to have these shares canceled. On July 24, 2015, 7,000,000
	shares issued to two other non-related parties were canceled. For the year ended
	July 31, 2015, the dilutive effect of not canceling the 60,000,000 shares is
	incorporated in the consolidated financial statements as the Company recorded
	such shares as issued and outstanding. The loss per share remained $0.00 with
	the dilutive effect of not canceling such shares. If the shares are not
	voluntarily returned for cancellation, the Company will need to commence
	litigation in Delaware to obtain a judgment to cancel the shares for lack of
	consideration. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate the cost such
	litigation if it takes place.






	Item 2  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of




	Overview



	Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd. was originally incorporated
	as Goa Sweet Tours Ltd. in the State of Delaware on September 2, 2008. We were
	originally formed to provide personalized concierge tour packages to tourists
	who visit the State of Goa, India.


	On April 17, 2012, Goa Sweet Tours, Ltd. entered into Share
	Purchase Agreements (the Purchase Agreements), with Luck Sky International
	Investment Holdings Limited, an entity owned and controlled by Zhou Deng Rong,
	and certain of our former stockholders who owned, in the aggregate, 7,200,000
	shares of our common stock (90% of the then outstanding shares). Luck Sky
	International Investment Holdings Limited purchased such shares for an aggregate
	consideration of $235,000. The sale of such shares closed on May 15, 2012.


	On May 25, 2012, Goa Sweet Tours, Ltd. formed a corporation
	under the laws of the State of Delaware called Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co.,
	Ltd. ("Merger Sub") for the purpose of changing its name. On the same day, we
	acquired one hundred percent of the total outstanding shares of Merger Sub's
	common stock for cash. As such, Merger Sub became our wholly-owned
	subsidiary.


	21







	Effective as of May 29, 2012, Merger Sub was merged with and
	into the Company. As a result of the merger, the Companys corporate name was
	changed to Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd. Prior to the merger, Merger Sub
	had no liabilities and nominal assets and, as a result of the merger, the
	separate existence of the Merger Sub ceased. The Company was the surviving
	corporation in the merger and, except for the name change provided for in the
	Agreement and Plan of Merger, there was no change in the directors, officers,
	capital structure or business of the Company.


	On September 24, 2013, the Company acquired all of the shares
	of common stock of Lucksky (Hong Kong) Shares Limited, a Hong Kong corporation,
	for 250,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company, and agreed to acquire
	100% of the shares of Sanhe City LuckSky Electrical Engineering Limited
	(Sanhe) common stock for the Companys common stock. As of the acquisition
	merger, Lucksky (Hong Kong) Shares Limited and Sanhe had no liabilities and
	nominal assets. Effective as of September 24, 2013, Lucksky (Hong Kong) Shares
	Limited was merged with and into the Company and the Company was the surviving
	entity. The Company acquired Sanhe in July 2014.


	On May 30, 2014, the Company entered into the Stock Purchase
	Agreement with Zhou Jian, the sole shareholder of Luck Sky (Hong Kong)
	Aerodynamic Electricity Limited (LuckSky Aerodynamic). Effective May 30, 2014
	the Company purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock
	of Luck Sky Aerodynamic , and the Company paid Zhou Jian a purchase price in the
	amount of HKD $10,000.00 (approximately USD$1,289.98) in cash (the
	Acquisition). Neither Luck Sky Shen Zhen nor Luck Sky Aerodynamic had any
	operating business and nominal or liabilities and nominal assets as of the date
	of the Acquisition. As a result of the Acquisition, Luck Sky Aerodynamic became
	our wholly owned subsidiary and Luck Sky Shen Zhen became our indirect
	subsidiary through Luck Sky Aerodynamic.


	LuckSky Group was established in 2000 by Zhou Deng Rong after
	he obtained a series of patents and developed the air compression and related
	technology. Sanhe was established in July 2013 and was under common control with
	LuckSky Group. Since inception, Sanhe served as a distributor of products of the
	LuckSky Group and its subsidiaries.


	22






	During the three months ended June 30, 2014, LuckSky Group
	provided Sanhe with additional working capital and transferred to Sanhe its
	assets and liabilities related to the compressed air energy storage power
	generation technology and PV panel installations, but retained its other assets.
	On April 1, 2014, LuckSky Group loaned Sanhe RMB3, 000,000. The equipment,
	including machinery, was sold to Sanhe for RMB7, 681,000, its book value,
	Xiangtian Kelitai, Yanjiao Branch, a division of LuckSky Group on May 26, 2014.
	On April 30, 2014, the inventory was sold to Sanhe by Xiangtian Kelitai, Yanjiao
	Branch, and a division of LuckSky Group for RMB 130,918.80, its historical
	value. On May 19, 2014, Sanhe entered into an office equipment transfer
	(purchase) agreement with Xiangtian Kelitai, Yanjiao Branch, a division of
	LuckSky Group for a purchase price of RMB162, 900. Sanhe entered into leases
	with LuckSky


	Group for a portion of the factory, office space and dormitory
	located in Sanhe City and a lease with Dong Yi Glass Machine Company Limited,
	which is owned by Deng Zhou Rong, our former CEO, for a second factory and
	office space. In addition, 48 employees transferred from LuckSky Group to Sanhe,
	including all personnel related to the projects under construction and
	development and administrative and finance personnel.



	Acquisition of Sanhe



	On July 25, 2014, Sanhe and Luck Sky Shen Zhen and Sanhes
	shareholders entered into a series of agreements known as variable interest
	agreements (the VIE Agreements) pursuant to which Sanhe became LuckSky Shen
	Zhens contractually controlled affiliate. The VIE Agreements include the
	Framework Agreement on Business Cooperation, the Exclusive Management Consulting
	and Training and Technical Services Agreement, the Exclusive Option Agreement,
	the Equity Pledge Agreement, the Know-How Sub-License Agreement and the
	Power-of-Attorney. The purpose and effect of the VIE Agreements is to provide
	LuckSky Shen Zhen (our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary) with all of the
	management and control of Sanhe and all of its net income. While LuckSky Shen
	Zhen does not actually own at present any of the equity and shares in Sanhe, the
	purpose and effect of the VIE Agreements is to instill in Luck Sky Shen Zhen
	total management and voting control of Sanhe for all material purposes. The use
	of VIE agreements is a common structure used to acquire PRC corporations,
	particularly in certain industries in which foreign investment is restricted or
	forbidden by the PRC government.



	Reincorporation in Nevada



	We reincorporated in Nevada effective October 31, 2016 as a
	result of a merger of Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co., Ltd., a Delaware
	corporation, with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Xiangtian (USA) Air Power Co.,
	Ltd., a Nevada corporation.



	Results of Operations



	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
	unaudited condensed consolidated Financial Statement of the Company for the
	three-month period ended January 31, 2017 and 2016 and related notes
	thereto.

	months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016. A couple of small projects were
	completed and $800,377 of panel subassembly was sold in this period. The revenue consisted of selling air
	compression related machines in the comparison period.


	Cost of Sales


	We have recognized $834,113 and $1,528 cost of revenue for the
	three months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016. The costs were in line with the
	revenue.


	23






	Gross Profit


	Gross profit was $131,783 for the three months ended January
	31, 2017, compared to $982 for the three months ended January 31, 2016.


	Operating Expenses


	For the three months ended January 31, 2017, we have incurred
	total operating expenses in the amount of $479,365, which mainly comprised
	selling expenses of $5,163, professional expenses of $61,612, salary expenses of
	$208,070, rental fees of $31,511, and general and administrative expenses
	totaling $173,009. For the three months ended January 31, 2016, we have incurred

	selling expenses of $4,837, professional expenses of $91,322, salary expenses of
	$95,204 and general and administrative expenses totaling $80,119. The increase
	in operating expenses by $207,883, or 76.6%, was primarily due to the increase
	amounts of salary expenses for a larger scale of operations.



	Six-month period ended January 31, 2017 compared to
	six-month period ended January 31, 2016



	Revenue


	We have recognized $1,052,656 and $69,120 in revenue for the six
	months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016. A couple of small projects were
	completed and $800,377 of panel subassembly was sold in this period. The revenue
	consisted of
	referred to selling air compression related machines in the comparison period.


	Cost of Sales


	We have recognized $905,712 and $63,543 cost of revenue for the
	six months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016. The increase in cost of sales is due
	to increase in sales.


	Gross Profit


	Gross profit was $146,944 for the six months ended January 31,
	2017, compared to $5,577 for the six months ended January 31, 2016.


	Operating Expenses


	For the six months ended January 31, 2017, we incurred total
	operating expenses in the amount of $1,186,217, which mainly comprised selling
	expenses of $18,190, professional expenses of $259,357, salary expenses of
	$415,958, rental fees of $66,154, and general and administrative expenses
	totaling $426,558. For the six months ended January 31, 2016, we incurred total
	operating expenses in the amount of $635,134, which mainly comprised selling
	expenses of $9,347, professional expenses of $180,866, salary expenses of
	$188,127, rental fees of $67,543, and general and administrative expenses
	totaling $189,251. The increase in operating expenses by $551,083, or 86.8%, was
	primarily due to the increase amounts of salary expenses for a larger scale of
	operations.



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	As of January 31, 2017, we had a cash balance of $69,714.
	During the six months ended January 31, 2017, net cash used in operating
	activities totaled $866,235. Net cash used in investing activities totaled
	$195,454. Net cash provided by financing activities during the period totaled
	$445,447. The resulting change in cash for the period was a decrease of
	$1,156,506, which was primarily due to cash outflow to suppliers, albeit we had
	a cash inflow from related parties and customers.


	As of January 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $75,440.
	During the six months ended January 31, 2016, net cash used in operating
	activities totaled $749,620. Net cash provided from investing activities totaled
	$17,110. Net cash provided by financing activities during the period totaled
	$448,080. The change in the use of net cash for the period was a decrease of
	$426,589, which was primarily due to cash outflow to suppliers coupled with a
	decline in cash inflow of the amounts due from customers, related parties and
	shareholders.


	As of January 31, 2017, we had current liabilities of
	$9,018,454, which was mainly comprised of accounts payable and accrued
	liabilities of $3,696,693, amount due to directors of $416,040, amount due to
	shareholders of $84,342, amount due to related parties of $2,165,588, advance
	from customers of $123,531, deferred tax liabilities of $34,949, other payables
	of $237,047, income tax payable of $327,535 and net advance billings of
	$1,932,729. As of July 31, 2016, we had current liabilities of $8,275,631, which
	was mainly comprised of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4,851,630,
	amount due to directors of $414,876, amount due to related parties of
	$1,716,734, advance from customers of $620,814, deferred tax liabilities of
	$107,609, other payables of $234,791 and income tax payable of $329,177.


	We had net assets of $7,188,114 and $8,502,334 as of January
	31, 2017 and July 31, 2016, respectively.


	As of January 31, 2017, we had 21 project contracts. Seven were
	completed; seven of them are in process, two of them is being canceled and five
	are about to start. Three projects in Shandong province commenced operations in 2015, one project in Fujian
	province commenced operation in February 2016, the two projects in Hubei and
	Zhejiang commenced operations in March 2016 and one in Hubei commenced in April
	2016. The projects in Shanxi province and Sichuan province were cancelled. The
	project in Heilongjiang is about to completed in February 2017. The other two
	projects in Hubei are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017.
	The three projects in Hebei are expected to be completed in September 2017. The
	processing project in Shandong is expected to be completed in April 2017. We are
	dependent on these projects for all our projected revenue until we obtain
	additional customers and any material delay or reduction in the projected cash
	receipts will adversely affect our operations. While we expect to generate
	revenue on the completion of our projects to meet the liquidity and capital
	resources of our operations, delayed receipts may cause going concern
	issues.


	24






	We expect to finance operations from progress billings from
	ongoing projects and through non-interest bearing loans from the Companys
	directors. We estimate that our cash and cash equivalents and projected cash
	receipts from operations are sufficient to fund operations for the next six
	months. However, additional funds may be required given our continued losses
	from operations. Additional funding may come from equity financing from the sale
	of our common stock or from borrowings, but there can be no assurance that such
	financing will be available on acceptable terms. If we are successful in
	completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution
	of their interest in our company.


	The Company has incurred losses since its inception resulting
	in an accumulated deficit of $1,784,876 as of January 31, 2017 and further
	losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial
	doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to
	continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable
	operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its
	obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations
	when they become due. Our future financial results are also uncertain due to a
	number of factors, some of which are outside our control. These risk factors
	include, but are not limited to:




	 


	


	our ability to raise additional funding;




	 


	 


	 




	 


	


	the results of our proposed operations.





	Going Concern Consideration



	Our operations and financial results are subject to numerous
	various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business,
	financial condition and results of operations.



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including
	arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk
	support and credit risk support or other benefits.



	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
	make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
	during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	25








	Fair Value Measurements




	The Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10,
	Fair Value Measurements, for fair value measurements of financial assets and
	financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that
	are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements. ASC 820
	also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
	about fair value measurements.


	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
	sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
	market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value
	measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at
	fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in
	which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants
	would use when pricing the asset or liability.


	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an
	entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
	unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels
	of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
	highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
	assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to
	measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:


	[
	]          Level 1 inputs to the
	valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or
	liabilities in active markets.


	[
	]          Level 2 inputs to the
	valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
	in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability,
	either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
	instruments.


	[
	]          Level 3 inputs to the
	valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.


	There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a
	recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of January
	31, 2017 and July 31, 2016.



	Billings in Excess of Costs



	Billings in excess of costs is comprised of cash collected from
	customers and billings to customers on contracts in advance of work performed,
	including advance payments negotiated as a contract condition. Generally,
	unearned project-related costs will be earned over the next twelve months.



	Revenue Recognition



	Sales of power generation system in conjunction of system
	installation are recognized under accounting for construction-type contracts,
	using the completed contract method. Accordingly, revenue is recognized upon the
	completion of the construction, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement
	exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the fee is fixed and
	determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We provide for any loss that
	we expect to incur on these contracts when that loss is probable.


	26







	Warranty and Returns



	The Company generally provides limited warranties for work
	performed under its contracts. The warranty periods typically extend for a
	limited duration following substantial completion of the Company's work on a
	project. At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty
	costs. Such estimated costs for warranties are included in the individual
	project cost estimates for purposes of accounting for long-term contracts. The
	warranty cost is estimated based on our experience with the type of work and any
	known risks relative to the project and was not material during the periods
	ended January 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016.


	No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Replacement
	part returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized.



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
	issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which modifies
	existing requirements regarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or
	market. Under existing standards, the market amount requires consideration of
	replacement cost, net realizable value (NRV), and NRV less an approximately
	normal profit margin. The new ASU replaces market with NRV, defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business,
	less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
	This eliminates the need to determine and consider replacement cost or NRV less
	an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. The amendments
	are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for
	annual and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The
	Company is currently assessing this ASUs impacts on the Companys consolidated
	results of operations and financial condition.


	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,
	Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The new
	consolidation standard changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether
	(a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees
	paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE,
	and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting
	enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. The guidance
	is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in
	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is allowed,
	including early adoption in an interim period. A reporting entity may apply a
	modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to
	equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption or may apply the
	amendments retrospectively. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the
	adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation
	of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). This standard is
	intended to define managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is
	substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and
	to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments contained in this ASU
	apply to all companies and not-for-profit organizations. The amendments are
	effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual
	and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is
	currently assessing this ASUs impact on the Companys consolidated results of
	operations and financial condition.


	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from
	Contracts with Customers, which provides a single comprehensive model to be used
	in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and
	supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including
	industry-specific guidance. The standards stated core principle is that an
	entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
	services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
	entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To
	achieve this core principle the ASU includes provisions within a five step model
	that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the
	performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price,
	allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing
	revenue when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance obligation. The standard
	also specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract
	with a customer and requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. The
	standard provides for either full retrospective adoption or a modified
	retrospective adoption by which it is applied only to the most current period
	presented. This ASU is effective January 1, 2017. The Company is currently
	assessing this ASUs impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations
	and financial condition.


	27






	The Company believes that there were no other accounting
	standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on
	our financial position or results of operations.






	Item 3  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
	Market Risk





	Foreign Exchange Risk




	While our reporting currency is the US dollar, almost all of
	our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are denominated in
	RMB. All of our assets are denominated in RMB except for some cash and cash
	equivalents and accounts receivables. As a result, we are exposed to foreign
	exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by
	fluctuations in the exchange rate between US dollar and RMB. The RMB has
	recently depreciated against the US dollar and if the RMB depreciates further
	against the US dollar, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as
	expressed in our US dollar financial statements will decline. We have not
	entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to
	foreign exchange risk.




	Inflation




	Inflationary factors such as increases in the costs of our
	products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results.
	Inflation in China has recently increased substantially. The inflation rate in
	China was reported at approximately 1.8% percent for 2016 and 1.4% for 2015(see
	http://www.statista.com/statistics/270338/inflation-rate-in-china/). These
	factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, of various
	corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate
	growth and contain inflation. Price inflation can affect our ability to maintain
	current levels of gross margin and selling and distribution, general and
	administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if we are unable to pass
	along raw material price increases to customers. Accordingly, inflation in China
	may weaken our competitiveness domestically or in international markets.






	Item 4. Controls and Procedures





	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	The term disclosure controls and procedures (defined in SEC
	Rule 13a-15(e)) refers to the controls and other procedures of a company that
	are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in
	the reports that it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
	Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required
	time periods. The Companys management, with the participation of the Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
	of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
	this quarterly report on Form 10-Q (the Evaluation Date). Based on that
	evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
	have concluded that, because of material weaknesses, our internal control over
	financial reporting was not effective.


	The material weaknesses we noticed include a (i) lack of
	accounting personnel with appropriate knowledge of accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), (ii) lack of a
	comprehensive accounting policies and procedures manual in accordance with U.S.
	GAAP, and (iii) lack of risk assessment process.


	In order to improve the efficiency of our internal control over
	financial reporting, we have taken and are implementing the following
	measures:


	- We plan to establish a desired level of corporate governance
	with regard to identifying and measuring the risk of material misstatements.


	- We will establish a key monitoring mechanism such as
	independent directors and an audit committee to oversee and monitor the
	Companys risk management, business strategies and financial reporting
	procedure.


	- We plan to strengthen our financial team by employing more
	qualified accountant(s) to enhance the quality of our financial reporting
	function.




	Changes in internal controls.




	The term internal control over financial reporting (defined
	in SEC Rule 13a-15(f)) refers to the process of a company that is designed to
	provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
	and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys management, with
	the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
	has evaluated any changes in the Companys internal control over financial
	reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2017, and they have
	concluded that there was no change to the Companys internal control over
	financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
	materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
