Jernigan Capital IPO Adds A Little Risk To The Self Storage REIT Market - Jernigan Capital (NYSE:JCAP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Jernigan Capital IPO Adds A Little Risk To The Self Storage REIT MarketMar.25.15 | About: Jernigan Capital (JCAP) APBK Capital Special situations, portfolio strategy, macro, commoditiesSummaryJernigan Capital was founded by Dean Jernigan, former CEO of CubeSmart and Storage USA.
        The company aims to refinance riskier loans that are coming due with high-yield structured deals.
        The REIT should generate better than average returns, given the risk adjustment,
        Overview
Jernigan Capital (Pending:JCAP) is tendering 5 million shares in its initial public offering, which is set for the week of March 23. The stock is priced in the range of $19-$21 per share, and is expected to raise $100 million in capital. Jernigan is formed as a mortgage-based REIT focused on lending to Self Storage facilities. Net proceeds from the IPO will go towards structure loan products to finance Self Storage facilities. The final market cap of the company will be around $200 million. Jernigan is an interesting investment because of its founder, Dean Jernigan, a successful name in Self Storage REITs. Investors looking to get in early on another success story should consider adding Jernigan to their portfolio.
Dean Jernigan
Most reviews of REITs will start off by examining and analyzing capital structure, investment prospects, and yield outlook, but this stock is different. The most important factor for Jernigan is Dean Jernigan. Dean is a veteran of the industry, and served as CEO of both CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) and Storage USA, which was purchased by GE Capital (NYSE:GE). In his latest venture, the goal is not to launch or build a self-storage company, rather he is lending money to unit owner/operators.
The primary driver behind the new business is the $10 billion in commercial mortgage-backed security loans that come due within the next five years. Refinancing these loans will present a great opportunity for experienced lenders who could create value not only though loan interest but also providing industry expertise. The company will focus on lending to a market niche: units in the large metro areas with higher loan-to-value ratios. These units typically struggle to finance loans with traditional lenders.

Current Prospects
Proceeds from the IPO have already been spent. Not literally, however Jernigan has been working since October to secure term sheets with several project sites. The following list shows prospective candidates for financing.

The REIT
Current term sheets appear to consistently carry an interest rate of 6.9%, with many deals also including 50% equity participation. These deals should translate to excellent cash flow for the company. The question will be how will the market value this company once the cash flow starts coming in. At 6.9% interest rate, and half of the company owner by insiders, the market would command about a 3.4%-3.5% dividend yield, assuming ownership interest covers the company's operating expenses. If the company can produce excess equity cash flow, it may push current yield up slightly toward 4%.

Market Risks
The big question is how will the rest of the market respond to Jernigan. Right now a 4% yield on self storage REITs is above average. However, Jernigan is lending to a riskier subset of the market, therefore risk adjusted yield appears to be in-line with expectations. Nevertheless, investors might not see it that way. There are two other possibilities. First, they may find a tremendous amount of confidence in Jernigan and drive the yield down by inflating the stock price compared to the current offering. The other option is investors may not know how to price the risk and drive yield up, and stock price down until the company has some proven operating history.

In any event the investment prospect is solid. In scenario 1, investors get an outstanding dividend with limited price movement in the underlying stock - Win. In scenario 2, stock price is driven up; investors can take short-term gains and wait for stabilization - Win. And in scenario 3, investors can cost average the purchase price of the stock after a dip, command a higher interest rate and wait for stabilization - Win - with or without eventual stabilization.
Summary
Jernigan is structured to be a very attractive REIT, and it clearly has very knowledgeable and proven leadership behind it. The Self Storage industry has been booming over the past decade, outperforming most other REIT categories. Adding Jernigan to any REIT portfolio is an excellent investment play.

There is a lot of data coming online soon to track new supply. Companies like STR, Reis, and Yardi are making good progress in this area.

Biggest threat to JCAP is overbuilding, but we believe demand remains sufficient to absorb new supply in all but a few major markets.

Former CubeSmart CEO Dean Jernigan jumps into self-storage lending business
Alexander Harris
January 9, 2014
1





Dean Jernigan might have retired recently from the top spot at CubeSmart LP, but the industry veteran isn’t finished working in the self-storage sector. In fact, he’s looking to lend millions of dollars to self-storage operators.
Following his long-planned exit as CEO of publicly traded self-storage REIT CubeSmart, Jernigan just launched his new venture: Jernigan Capital LLC.
“I’m still a young guy,” the 67-year-old Jernigan told The Storage Facilitator. “I stay very active and have no interest in retiring. Storage has been my life for 30 years now.”
From Borrower to Lender
Jernigan Capital, based in Miami Beach, FL, is a merchant bank and advisory firm catering solely to the self-storage industry. Jernigan said he’s investing his own money to back the loans. He’s also recruiting an institutional joint venture partner to contribute capital.
“I decided that all the things I’ve learned over the years being a borrower, I’d like to use as a lender,” Jernigan said. “I think I have a unique perspective to offer many people out there looking to build, buy or refinance a facility.”
Jernigan entered the self-storage business in 1985 after building his first facility in Memphis, TN. The company Jernigan founded, Storage USA, went on to become the first publicly traded storage REIT. After GE Capital bought that company, Jernigan started a development firm. But it was only a few years later, in 2006, that he was recruited as CEO of U-Stor-It, now known as CubeSmart.
With his latest venture, Jernigan will be looking to issue loans to operators starting at $1 million for single-asset acquisitions. He said most loans should be in the $8 million to $10 million range.
Jernigan expects to start signing deals in March. In the meantime, Jernigan is working on hiring staff. He already has assembled an advisory board to help vet deals.

Spurred by CMBS
One motivating factor Jernigan cites for entering the lending side of the business is the $10 billion in self-storage CMBS loans that are coming due over the next five years.
“Many of these people will struggle to refinance their existing loan amounts,” Jernigan said.
Why? Many self-storage properties built between 2005 and 2008 didn’t perform as well as forecast, he said, and aren’t able to borrow much under traditional refinancing programs.
“My plan is to be a source for those people,” Jernigan said.
Jernigan Capital will be considering deals in the top 50 metro areas with higher loan-to-value ratios than typical lenders would.
The firm also will provide loans for acquisitions and development projects.
“We are coming back into a development cycle, and banks that have traditionally been lenders for people who are developing storage facilities are fairly hamstrung nowadays with all kinds of regulatory requirements,” Jernigan said.
For development loans, Jernigan will focus only on the top 20 metro areas.
Keeping an Eye on Interest Rates
Jernigan is monitoring the effect that rising interest rates will have on the self-storage industry. Rates are creeping up, and he said that’s likely to prevent the volume of acquisitions like the industry saw in 2013.
“Potential sellers out there are going to have to adjust their expectations on values because the cost of capital is going up,” said Jernigan, citing news that the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering above 3 percent.
A rise in interest rates will push up cap rates, which will diminish the appetite for large portfolios, Jernigan said. However, he still expects the industry to keep consolidating.
One- and two-facility deals “will continue in a pretty big way,” Jernigan said.

Jernigan Capital: The Self-Storage Development REIT - Jernigan Capital (NYSE:JCAP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Jernigan Capital: The Self-Storage Development REITNov.22.16 | About: Jernigan Capital (JCAP) Tom Flannigan REITs, Real Estate Investing, Self Storage, brick & mortar retailAvalanche Storage GroupSummaryJernigan Capital is a self-storage lending REIT led by a team of industry experts funding attractive development opportunities.The company lends at 6.9% and retains 49.9% equity in each development.JCAP's shares appear to be significantly undervalued.

 Source: Jernigan Capital Jernigan Capital (NYSE:JCAP) is a lender that is classified as a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust). Jernigan Capital began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2015. Shares of the REIT performed poorly in late 2015 and early 2016. Similar to National Storage Affiliates (NYSE:NSA), I believe there is a buying opportunity right now for shares of JCAP. My last article mentioned JCAP and focused on National Storage Affiliates. In this article, I will dive into the benefits and caveats of owning JCAP's shares. What is Jernigan Capital? To answer questions about the self-storage lending REIT, it helps to know about Dean Jernigan. Who is Dean Jernigan? 

 Source: Jernigan Capital Dean Jernigan knows storage. Dean knows lending. Dean knows what it takes to build a team of professionals that create value. Back in 1984, Mr. Jernigan started with a single property that grew into more than 570 properties at its peak. If you invested in Storage USA, you know that the company returned over 17% compounded annual return while Dean was at the helm. Storage USA was eventually sold to GE (NYSE:GE) Capital. While most wealthy individuals would hang it up after a smashing success like Storage USA, Dean forged ahead and accepted another challenge.
 In 2006, Dean Jernigan was asked to lead a $2 billion REIT in need of rebuilding and rebranding. Dean accepted the position of CEO at U-Store-It and the company became CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE). As I referenced in my previous article, CubeSmart performed very well coming out of the great recession and Dean's lasting impact continues to be a theme for CUBE and storage industry. When Mr. Jernigan left CUBE, the company had grown to a $4 billion market capitalization. Considering the Storage USA and CubeSmart track record, Mr. Jernigan seems to have the Midas touch in the industry. 

 Source: CubeSmart With Mr. Jernigan leading the way, Jernigan capital was formed in 2013. It is laser focused on lending to self-storage developers. A significant amount of its value proposition is based on its expertise. Mr. Jernigan has passed his knowledge to a team of hard working professionals who are truly committed to their partners, the industry and to their shareholders. JCAP went public in early 2015 and raised over $100 million of funds to commit to storage developers. How does the Jernigan Capital lending platform operate? A typical self-storage developer needs capital and expertise. While industrial and multifamily developers can easily obtain capital and expertise in their respective areas, a self-storage developer doesn't have the same luxury. Municipalities tend to frown upon storage developers because they don't create as many jobs or as much tax revenue compared to an industrial plant or a multifamily apartment. In addition, banks are less excited about funding self storage. For today, I will focus more on the lending aspect of a self-storage development. 


 Source: Jernigan Capital Lending 101 in the 1990s was described as such: Borrow capital at 3%, lend at 6%, and tee off at the golf course by 2pm. Shares of bank stocks ripped higher and ample self-storage supply came to market. While self-storage industry leader Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) grew relatively slowly in the '90s, banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) performed very well. Following the global financial crisis, the "invisible hand" moved capital away from banks and into stable growers and dividend payers. For example, shares of JPM showed very little growth from 2007 to 2014. Meanwhile, a lack of self-storage supply allowed storage REITs such as PSA to fill units, raise rents, and provide an excellent return to shareholders. 

 The rules have changed. Banks are no longer excited about lending to tech startups or first-time self-storage developer as they once were. The tech bubble burst and the real estate market crashed. Bankers are no longer hanging out it in hot tubs with Newt Gingrich, Janeane Garofalo, and Scottie Pippen. 

 Source: Simpsonsworld.com The great recession and the concurrent global financial crisis created new rules for lenders. The Basel Accords, Dodd-Frank, and other various regulations have altered the banking landscape. In short, it is more difficult for a developer to get capital for their projects. Solution: Borrow from Jernigan Capital A developer in Colorado needs a line of credit to develop a state-of-the-art self-storage facility. The facility is climate controlled and has all the necessary entitlements, building permits, and cumbersome details figured out. The developer wants a development partner with deep pockets. The developer knows Dean Jernigan because nearly everyone in the storage industry has heard his name. So Jernigan Capital provides an $11 million development loan to fund the investment in Colorado. The multi-story 879 unit facility will deliver 86,657 net rentable square feet of climate-controlled storage to a high-income underserved area of suburban Denver.
 

 The same story has played out with Jernigan Capital providing a credit line earning 6.9% interest in addition to origination and underwriting fees paid to the company. While the 6.9% interest rate is commensurate with the risk Jernigan Capital is taking, there is an added bonus: equity. For every development that JCAP funds, a 49.9% equity interest in the development is given to it. This is a very important concept for a JCAP shareholder to understand. Essentially, Jernigan Capital is loaning capital to become co-owners in high-quality facilities. According to my model, JCAP has more than $6 of book value per share that is not accounted for in the current book value. Until a facility sells, the equity that Jernigan Capital retains will not be reflected on the company's reported book value. Given the opportunity to deliver quality product to undersupplied markets, developers have jumped on the opportunity to partner with Jernigan Capital. 

 Source: Jernigan Capital The lending model appeals to developers who need capital and expertise. Thus far, Jernigan Capital has funded developments across the country in undersupplied markets. There is not a single facility that has been funded without a rigorous analysis by Mr. Jernigan's team of experts. In fact, I have personally presented many funding opportunities to Mr. Jernigan's team and found it is extremely cautious. It wants to fund high-quality developments and so far it is doing just that.
 Similar to the growth model used by National Storage Affiliates, Jernigan is carving a niche in the storage world. Where NSA is taking advantage of the opportunity to acquire or partner with regional storage operators, JCAP is taking advantage of the opportunity to develop. Mr. Jernigan has spoken highly of National Storage Affiliates on conference calls, and there could be a potential transaction between the two in the future. As NSA continues to grow, high-quality JCAP properties will become acquisition targets for NSA and the other storage REITs. JCAP's shares appear to be undervalued based on the company's improving fundamentals. Additional access to capital has been obtained by JCAP and should allow the company to grow quite quickly. Initially, expenses at Jernigan Capital were higher than most sell-side analysts anticipated. This was addressed earlier in the year, and for now, expenses seem to be in line. The Jernigan Capital lending model appears to be valid based on early results. As the company has made progress on developments, shares have turned around. After hitting an all-time low earlier in the year, JCAP's shares are now trading above $18. Valuation REITs and banks often trade above "book" value. For example, many banks in the S&P 500 bank index (NYSEARCA:XLF) trade above 1.5x book value. Considering the heightened risk that a developer has and the size of Jernigan Capital, I believe JCAP should trade at a more modest 1.2x book value. Currently, my model has JCAP achieving book value of $19 in 2017. Note that this does not include the projected $6 of added book value that JCAP retains today. All things considered, I believe JCAP should trade at $23 per share.

After retiring from the role of CEO of CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) in 2013, he founded Jernigan Capital as the only direct lender focused exclusively on the self storage industry.

During its life as a public company and under his leadership as Chairman and CEO, the company returned a 17.5% compounded annual return to its investors. Following the sale of the company to GE Capital, he formed Jernigan Property Group which assembled a portfolio of 17 properties in a short 18 months seizing upon the opportunity of a short acquisition cycle that presented itself.
In 2006, Jernigan accepted the challenge of rebuilding and rebranding U-Store-It which became CubeSmart. During his tenure as CEO, the company’s market capitalization more than doubled from approximately $2B to more than $4B. With extensive experience and knowledge in more than 100 US markets as a developer, owner and manager of self storage facilities, Dean has earned his reputation as an industry innovator, leader and icon.
