People's Securities, Inc.


                  People's Securities' primary investment strategies used in servicing client accounts are a long-term investment approach, asset allocation, and diversification. The firm generally provides investment advisory services to clients through two methods.One method is People's Securities' Managed Advisory Portfolio Program (MAP). It is a model-based approach in which the firm employs outside sub-advisors to manage multiple client accounts using standardized portfolios containing open-end mutual funds, ETFs, and ‘stock basket portfolios’. Neither People's Securities nor any of their associated persons exercises discretion regarding specific transactions in these portfolios. Rather, the firm delegates their responsibility for selecting particular securities transactions in these portfolios to one or more managers which provide these services. In the MAP, all or a portion of a client’s assets may be allocated to one or more of the following programs: the SEI Program; the SEI Managed Account Program and the SEI Integrated Managed Account Program; the Morningstar Managed Portfolios Program; and the PFA Program (which is closed to new clients).The other method is a a fee-only investment management service providing discretionary or non-discretionary account management through Olson Mobeck Investment Advisors (OMIA), a division of People’s Securities. The OMIA Program is based on OMIA staff providing continuous advice to, and OMIA personnel making investment recommendations for, each client based on the individual needs of that client. OMIA, in conjunction with the client, develops the client’s personal investment policy based on a client’s individual goals, objectives and circumstances.
