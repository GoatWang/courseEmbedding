  Mike Rhodin is Senior Vice President for Watson, one of IBM's most significant innovations in the company's 100-year history. Watson is charged with accelerating a new class of software, services and apps that think, learn and will fuel a diverse cloud-based ecosystem of enterprises, tech companies and entrepreneurs.
  Before heading up Watson, Mike led the Software Solutions Group delivering industry-specific solutions in high-growth areas such as Business Analytics, Smarter Commerce, Smarter Cities and Social Business.
  Mike's 30-year career at IBM has been infused with a passion for helping clients extract value from their technology investments, improving their business performance, and simplifying the way people work.

  Mike has also held a number of general management positions across IBM, including the Software business where he led the introduction of IBM's social business platform, which IDC has deemed #1 for four years in a row.
  Mike has been instrumental in helping build our globally integrated enterprise when he was the leader of IBM Northeast Europe, which included Germany, UK, Switzerland, Austria and the Nordics.
  Mike joined IBM in 1984 after he graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
