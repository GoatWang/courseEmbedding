* Not from the offering secured funds (Director loaned)

The above figures represent only estimated costs. Maksim Charniak, our president
and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds if needed. Loan
agreement with Mr. Charniak is non- binding and discretionary. These loans would
be necessary if the proceeds from this offering are not sufficient to implement
our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC 
Electronic Bulletin Board. Mr. Charniak will not be paid any compensation from
the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the
funds advanced by Mr. Charniak. Mr. Charniak will be repaid from revenues of
operations if and when we generate sufficient revenues to pay the obligation.


We expect to face increasing competition in the online and offline legal 
services markets from law firms, solo attorneys, online legal document services,
national legal plans and other service providers, and our failure to effectively
compete with these providers may adversely affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition and future prospects.

Among other, we intend to provide legal documents service. The online legal
document services market is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly 
competitive. Other companies that focus on the online legal document services
market, and law firms that may elect to pursue the online legal document 
services market, could directly compete with us. Law firms and solo attorneys,
who provide in-person consultations and are able to provide direct legal advice
that we cannot offer due to laws and regulations regarding UPL, compete with us
offline and have and may develop competing online legal services. Many of the
potential competitors have focused on employer-sponsored markets or have 
acquired customers through in-person multi-level marketing.

Our competitors, whether they are online legal document providers, legal advice
providers, law firms or solo attorneys, may also be developing innovative and
cost-effective services that target our and potential customers. Therefore, we
expect to face increasing competition from offline and online legal services
providers in our market.

Some aspects of our business may operate, somewhat, similar to that of a 
McKenzie Friend, in England, which is a service that provides moral support to
litigants, takes notes and help with case papers and quietly would also advice
on point of law and procedure and issues litigants may wish to raise in court.
These McKenzie friends also attend court with clients.

A McKenzie friend assists a litigant in person in a court of law in England and
Wales. Their personnel does not need to be legally qualified. The crucial point
is that litigants in person are entitled to have assistance, lay or 
professional, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

We have identified a number of well established U.S. firms that we are likely to
be competing againstâthese are: LegalZoom, Rocketlawyer, Lawinfo, Avvo and 
Lawtrade.


Company Description
Glolex, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on March 2, 2016. We are a development
stage company and the purpose of our business is to have an easy to use, web
based, round-the-clock, online, legal, consulting advice service [chargeable].
However, the first session will be free of charge, to attract


 new customers, but
further consulting services will come with a fee. The intention is to provide
advice, answers, mentoring and blank legal forms (templates) to customers who
are seeking legal information. The website will cover business law, corporate
law and general law.

The second aspect of our business will be a telephone app. This app will provide
telephone communication with a speaking solicitor who can cite the laws and 
normative acts selected by the user, and explain their rights within any 
specified subject matter. A user enters the application, and selects the subject
matter âcustomersâ rightsâ, then they choose the relevant section and click a
key. An attractive lawyer appears on the screen and reads their rights, which
may later be downloaded onto their phone/computer as a separate file.

The second feature of the app will be a lawyer quick search. This is
comprehensive list of lawyers and attorneys, in the districts closest to your
own location with their area of expertise specified; from housing law to 
misdemeanors from artistic copyright law to crime. This will be a useful app for
emergencies, for example if you find yourself under arrest but with your âone
phone call,â you could use this app to secure legal representation. This app
will be called âBackmeupâ.

The app will be free for both lawyers and consumers because we will design it to
make money from advertising.

We are not a law firm, and we do not provide legal advice. We provide self-help
legal information at our customers' specific direction and general information
on legal issues generally encountered. Independent, licensed attorneys will
participate in our attorney network to provide services to our customers through
our platforms.

Furthermore, the Company will also provide corporate consulting services. We
will provide a range of services to individuals and organisations, with
particular emphasis on:

Company registraion/incorporation, sole propriotor registration/consulatation,
strategic business planning, communication with the government institutions.

Specific services will be provided either by Glolex, Inc. or via our networked
of other consultants with particular expertise.

While we intend to engage in aforementioned business activity, there is no
actual assurance that we will be successful in developing our products and
services.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and âbest-effortsâ basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $100,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will
receive any proceeds from the offering.

* Not from the offering secured funds (Director loaned)

The above figures represent only estimated costs. Maksim Charniak, our president
and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds if needed. Loan
agreement with Mr. Charniak is non- binding and discretionary. These loans would
be necessary if the proceeds from this offering are not sufficient to implement
our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC 
Electronic Bulletin Board. Mr. Charniak will not be paid any compensation from
the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the
funds advanced by Mr. Charniak. Mr. Charniak will be repaid from revenues of
operations if and when we generate sufficient revenues to pay the obligation.


We expect to face increasing competition in the online and offline legal 
services markets from law firms, solo attorneys, online legal document services,
national legal plans and other service providers, and our failure to effectively
compete with these providers may adversely affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition and future prospects.

Among other, we intend to provide legal documents service. The online legal
document services market is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly 
competitive. Other companies that focus on the online legal document services
market, and law firms that may elect to pursue the online legal document 
services market, could directly compete with us. Law firms and solo attorneys,
who provide in-person consultations and are able to provide direct legal advice
that we cannot offer due to laws and regulations regarding UPL, compete with us
offline and have and may develop competing online legal services. Many of the
potential competitors have focused on employer-sponsored markets or have 
acquired customers through in-person multi-level marketing.

Our competitors, whether they are online legal document providers, legal advice
providers, law firms or solo attorneys, may also be developing innovative and
cost-effective services that target our and potential customers. Therefore, we
expect to face increasing competition from offline and online legal services
providers in our market.

Some aspects of our business may operate, somewhat, similar to that of a 
McKenzie Friend, in England, which is a service that provides moral support to
litigants, takes notes and help with case papers and quietly would also advice
on point of law and procedure and issues litigants may wish to raise in court.
These McKenzie friends also attend court with clients.

A McKenzie friend assists a litigant in person in a court of law in England and
Wales. Their personnel does not need to be legally qualified. The crucial point
is that litigants in person are entitled to have assistance, lay or 
professional, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

We have identified a number of well established U.S. firms that we are likely to
be competing againstâthese are: LegalZoom, Rocketlawyer, Lawinfo, Avvo and 
Lawtrade.


Company Description
Glolex, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on March 2, 2016. We are a development
stage company and the purpose of our business is to have an easy to use, web
based, round-the-clock, online, legal, consulting advice service [chargeable].
However, the first session will be free of charge, to attract


 new customers, but
further consulting services will come with a fee. The intention is to provide
advice, answers, mentoring and blank legal forms (templates) to customers who
are seeking legal information. The website will cover business law, corporate
law and general law.

The second aspect of our business will be a telephone app. This app will provide
telephone communication with a speaking solicitor who can cite the laws and 
normative acts selected by the user, and explain their rights within any 
specified subject matter. A user enters the application, and selects the subject
matter âcustomersâ rightsâ, then they choose the relevant section and click a
key. An attractive lawyer appears on the screen and reads their rights, which
may later be downloaded onto their phone/computer as a separate file.

The second feature of the app will be a lawyer quick search. This is
comprehensive list of lawyers and attorneys, in the districts closest to your
own location with their area of expertise specified; from housing law to 
misdemeanors from artistic copyright law to crime. This will be a useful app for
emergencies, for example if you find yourself under arrest but with your âone
phone call,â you could use this app to secure legal representation. This app
will be called âBackmeupâ.

The app will be free for both lawyers and consumers because we will design it to
make money from advertising.

We are not a law firm, and we do not provide legal advice. We provide self-help
legal information at our customers' specific direction and general information
on legal issues generally encountered. Independent, licensed attorneys will
participate in our attorney network to provide services to our customers through
our platforms.

Furthermore, the Company will also provide corporate consulting services. We
will provide a range of services to individuals and organisations, with
particular emphasis on:

Company registraion/incorporation, sole propriotor registration/consulatation,
strategic business planning, communication with the government institutions.

Specific services will be provided either by Glolex, Inc. or via our networked
of other consultants with particular expertise.

While we intend to engage in aforementioned business activity, there is no
actual assurance that we will be successful in developing our products and
services.
