                                    The idea was to just run VDI on Nutanix, but because we saw such perfect performance we started migrating other workloads. We're now running our SQL environment, Sharepoint, Exchange, our entire production on Nutanix.

Nutanix, Inc. Key Developments

Nutanix Reboots The Hybrid Cloud With Single OS for the Multi-cloud Era
Jun 28 17
Nutanix announced at its .NEXT Conference 2017 that the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS will be delivered as a full software stack with new multi-cloud capabilities in Nutanix CalmTM and a new cloud service called Nutanix XiTM Cloud Services. The new offerings take a fresh approach to hybrid cloud, empowering customers to use Nutanix Enterprise Cloud Software throughout their multi-cloud deployments, including on-premises with platforms from IBM ", Dell EMCTM, Lenovo ", Cisco " and HPE ", in the cloud via AWSTM, Google Cloud PlatformTM and AzureTM, or natively with Nutanix Xi Cloud Services. In the multi-cloud era, data and applications are dispersed not just across enterprise private and public clouds, but also distributed remote office/branch office (ROBO) and disaster recovery (DR) environments, as well as edge computing use cases. The current enterprises want to build these diverse deployment options into their end-to-end cloud designs, without disjointed IT operations or lock-in to any one virtualization or cloud stack. A single software OS brings a new approach to unifying these multiple clouds " across the full compute, storage and network stack " which dramatically simplifies operations with common IT tooling, enabling application mobility across clouds, while remaining open to any hardware, hypervisor, or cloud. Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS Software: Delivered as software, the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS supports a variety of hardware platforms, form factors and third-party vendors, ensuring that a single software fabric with unified management can run across all enterprise environments. The Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS extends beyond Nutanix-branded appliances, OEM offerings from Dell EMC and Lenovo and systems from partner IBM to flexible subscriptions and enterprise license agreements (ELAs) on Cisco and HPE platforms. For consumption as a service, IT leaders will be able to leverage Nutanix software as a native cloud-delivered solution via Xi Cloud Services - seamlessly extending the boundaries of their enterprise datacenter while preserving a consistent, simple one-click experience. Nutanix Xi Cloud Services: Xi Cloud Services will empower customers to instantly provision and consume Nutanix infrastructure on demand as a native extension of the enterprise datacenter, delivering a turnkey cloud service built from the same infrastructure stack with the same tooling and SLAs as the core Nutanix Enterprise Cloud Platform. The first available Xi Cloud Service will enable Nutanix customers to set up, manage and test a complete cloud-based DR service in just minutes. Using the same Prism management interface, Nutanix customers can instantly protect their applications and data inline with existing workflows as part of their routine IT operations, avoiding the expense and complexity of a separate DR solution. Nutanix will partner with strategic cloud providers to deliver Xi Cloud Services globally, and to meet the data provenance requirements governing multiple industries and use cases. Nutanix Calm: Building and operating a multi-cloud architecture requires that applications can be easily defined, instantiated and scaled independent of the cloud environment. Nutanix Calmabstracts application environments from the underlying infrastructure and recommends the right cloud for the right workload while harmonizing cloud operations. Nutanix Calm will allow applications to be defined via easy-to-use blueprints, which can be provisioned, managed and scaled into different cloud environments. The solution includes a powerful, integrated marketplace so that application designs can be shared across the organization to speed the time to production for new business initiatives. Calm leverages the full stack capabilities of the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS across network, compute and storage to holistically converge enterprise infrastructures on AHV, ESXi, Hyper-V, extended to Xi Cloud Services, as well as public clouds including AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Azure. Product Availability: The Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS is now available as a software-only offering for popular platforms from Cisco and HPE. Nutanix Calm is planned to be available for sale by calendar fourth quarter of 2017. Nutanix Xi Cloud Services for disaster recovery are planned to be offered for early access by calendar first quarter of 2018.


Nutanix Teams Up with Google Cloud to Fuse Cloud Environments for Enterprise Apps
Jun 28 17
Nutanix announced a strategic alliance with Google Cloud at the Nutanix .NEXT Conference 2017. As a result of the partnership, joint customers will be able to deploy and manage both cloud-based and traditional enterprise applications as a unified public cloud service, while blending the Nutanix environment with Google Cloud Platform™ (GCP).Google and Nutanix will work together to address the technology opportunities for building and operating hybrid clouds that combine the best of private cloud architectures and scalable public cloud environments. Enterprise customers will be able to leverage the combined power of Nutanix and the Google Cloud Platform for: - One-Click Hybrid Operations with Nutanix Calm™ for GCP enabling a single control plane for managing applications between GCP and Nutanix cloud environments. Traditional and cloud-native applications can be provisioned into GCP or Nutanix cloud environments with a single click, and migrated between the two cloud environments seamlessly. With Nutanix Calm, applications are modeled as simple, repeatable application blueprints that can be triggered with a single click and easily migrated across Nutanix and GCP environments. - Nutanix Xi™ Cloud Services on GCP enabling Nutanix customers to natively extend their datacenter environment into GCP and providing a unified fabric that will be able to deliver both traditional Mode 1 and modern Mode 2 applications to make lift-and-shift operations between private and public clouds easier. For example, enterprises could leverage a Xi Cloud Services Disaster Recovery running in GCP, and then run BigQuery analytics against the full application data set without expensive, repetitive data migration operations. - Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS with built-in support for Kubernetes® enabling container-based applications to be deployed, managed and scaled in a Nutanix Enterprise Cloud. A joint solution combining Kubernetes, Google Container Engine (GKE) and Acropolis Container Services (ACS) can provide an enterprise-grade environment for containers, including scalable persistent storage services for stateful application workloads. Cloud managers can quickly self-provision Kubernetes via a pre-defined application blueprint with Nutanix Calm, and instantiate containerized applications in either Google Cloud or a Nutanix-powered environment. In addition, Google and Nutanix have agreed to collaborate on Internet of Things (IoT) use-cases marrying real-time edge intelligence with core cloud computing. Customers can leverage Nutanix as an “intelligent edge” for GCP-based IoT applications by deploying TensorFlow for edge processing, while training machine learning models and running analytics on the processed metadata in GCP. A concept demo of this IoT platform will be unveiled at the Nutanix .NEXT conference at the session entitled “VS101: IoT and Edge Computing”. The integration of Nutanix Calm and Google Cloud Platform will be available in the first quarter of calendar year 2018. Other features are in development, and pricing details will be announced closer to the release.


Netmagic Partners with Nutanix to Offer Managed Enterprise Cloud Services
Jun 19 17
Nutanix announced its partnership with Netmagic, a subsidiary of NTT Communications. This partnership will enable Netmagic to offer Private Cloud Services built upon the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud Platform, to customers who either run their own datacenters or using Netmagic's dedicated datacenters based in India. Along with other recent partnerships, Nutanix has extended its reach exponentially across India, and is now placed to support the extensive digital transformation currently underway in the country.

It allows customers to deploy applications faster and scale rapidly as they grow. In addition, this partnership will enhance the security, scalability, reliability and flexibility for enterprises and provide them a tailor-made solution without compromising on the control of their IT infrastructure. The entire private hosted cloud service by Netmagic will be built on the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud Platform.

Cloud computing stocks can be great growth plays, but they can also quickly collapse on concerns about slowing sales growth, widening losses, and lofty valuations. That's exactly what happened to two recent cloud IPOs -- Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX). 
Twilio went public at $15 per share last June, soared to nearly $70 three months later, then fell back to the mid-$20s. Nutanix went public at $16 per share last September, peaked in the mid-$40s in early October, then stumbled back to the mid-teens.

Let's discuss what happened to these two recent IPOs, and whether or not investors should consider them potential turnaround plays at current prices.
What do Twilio and Nutanix do?
Twilio's cloud service delivers voice calls, SMS messages, videos, and other content for mobile apps. If developers want users to call or text each other from within their apps, they subscribe to Twilio's service and integrate its API into their apps. This is generally cheaper and more scalable than creating comparable features from scratch. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), for example, uses Twilio's API to enable WhatsApp and Messenger users to add other users via phone numbers. Twilio has also been gradually adding additional video, security, and enterprise administration features to this platform to boost its revenues per user. 
Nutanix is the market leader in hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) appliances and software-defined storage solutions. These products bundle traditional silos of server, storage, networking, virtualization, and data center management into a single turnkey solution. 
Nutanix claims that collapsing all those product categories into a single "converged" enterprise cloud platform will gradually make data center infrastructure "invisible." This can be a cost-effective solution for younger companies which haven't installed on-site infrastructure yet, and it can help older companies pivot away from on-site private cloud models toward more flexible "hybrid" cloud models that straddle both the private and public clouds.
How fast are Twilio and Nutanix growing?
Twilio's sales surged 66% to $277.3 million in fiscal 2016. Its "base" revenue -- which excludes revenue from "Variable Customer Accounts" (large customers which haven't signed 12-month minimum revenue commitment contracts) jumped 79% to $245.5 million.

However, Twilio expects just 28%-31% sales growth this year, partly due to waning business from its top customer, Uber. During its first quarter earnings report, Twilio disclosed that Uber -- which contributed 12% of Twilio's sales during the period -- plans to use other internal or third-party platforms for its calls and texts in the future.
That bombshell caused Twilio shares to plummet 26% on May 3. That development was also troubling because another Twilio customer, Lyft, recently announced that it would start testing Vonage's (NYSE:VG) Nexmo platform as an alternative to Twilio's service.
Nutanix's sales soared 85% to $444.9 million in fiscal 2016 on growing demand for HCI solutions. Wall Street expects sales to rise another 66% this year. Those numbers look solid, but a slowdown in sequential growth last quarter indicates that sales could peak this year. Moreover, Nutanix faces tough questions regarding Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's (NYSE:HPE) recent acquisition of its rival SimpliVity. 
That $650 million buyout is troubling because it makes HPE -- which already has a massive presence in enterprise hardware, software, and services -- the second largest player in the HCI market after Nutanix. HPE will inevitably bundle SimpliVity's services with its other enterprise products -- which could render Nutanix obsolete.
The short of it is that both businesses could lose customers in the near future.





How profitable are Twilio and Nutanix?
Twilio and Nutanix are both unprofitable, and analysts don't see them achieving either non-GAAP or GAAP profitability anytime soon. That's because the cost of running cloud servers, securing new customers, and offering competitive prices doesn't leave much room for profits -- unless the companies scale up dramatically. 
Twilio posted a non-GAAP net loss of $0.16 per share in 2016. Due to the gradual loss of Uber, the company expects that loss to widen to $0.27-$0.30 per share this year. That bottom line decline won't be good for its cash flow -- the company's cash and equivalents already dropped 61% sequentially to just $118.4 million last quarter. This raises the troubling possibility of another secondary offering in the near future.
Nutanix's net loss in fiscal 2016 is unknown. But the company's quarterly net loss nearly tripled last quarter, and it's expected to post a non-GAAP net loss of $1.49 per share this year. On the bright side, Nutanix's cash cushion remains strong, with its cash and equivalents staying nearly flat sequentially at $226 million last quarter.
The valuations and verdict
Twilio trades at 4.8 times sales, which is slightly lower than its industry average of 5.6. Nutanix's P/S ratio of 3.6 is also lower than the industry average of 5.5. Nonetheless, investors probably shouldn't consider either stock "cheap" due to their top line challenges and lack of profitability. 
Both stocks remain highly speculative plays, but I'd still pick Twilio over Nutanix because it dominates a valuable niche service and faces less direct competition. Nutanix is well-poised to profit from growing demand for HCI solutions, but I have doubts that it can survive competition from HPE and other tech giants which are all aggressively expanding into the same market.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
