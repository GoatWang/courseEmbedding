One401k

Policy form # IVA-2002 and policy form # FPIVA99 may not be available in all states.

Note: The One401k plan is funded by investing in an individual variable annuity contract issued by AUL.
Variable annuity contracts issued by American United Life Insurance Company® (AUL) are distributed by OneAmerica Securities, Inc., Member FINRA, SIPC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AUL. Both are located at One American Square, Indianapolis, IN 46282, (317) 285-1877. For a current prospectus that contains more complete information, including all charges, expenses, risks and limitations, please call or write us. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money. Certain products and/or investment options may not be available in all states. Certain contracts' features may differ depending on the state regulations under which the contract is governed.
AUL qualified plans are funded with group variable annuity contracts. While a contract owner may benefit from tax deferral under a qualified plan without the use of a group variable annuity contract, group variable annuities may provide additional investment flexibility and annuity-related benefits to contract owners and participants.
The investment return and principal value of the variable investment options will fluctuate so that the value of the investor's unit when redeemed may be worth more or less than its original cost. Investment return is not guaranteed and subject to market risk.
Dollar cost averaging does not ensure a profit and does not protect against loss in declining markets. Investors should consider their financial ability to continue investing in declining markets when the value of their investments may also be declining.
Withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and may incur a withdrawal charge. In addition, withdrawals made prior to age 59-1/2 may be subject to a 10 percent IRS tax penalty.
The death benefit guarantee is based on the claim-paying ability of American United Life Insurance Company®.
Variable annuities are not deposits or other obligations and are not guaranteed by any bank or credit union and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate (FDIC), the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) or any other federal entity. Variable annuities may lose value and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the principal amount invested.

     This  Prospectus  describes  individual  variable  annuity  contracts  (the
"Contracts")  offered by American United Life Insurance Company(R) ("AUL" or the
"Company").  AUL  designed  the  Contracts  for use in  connection  with non-tax
qualified  retirement  plans and  deferred  compensation  plans for  individuals
("Non-Qualified  Plans").   Contract  Owners  may  also  use  the  Contracts  in
connection  with  retirement  plans that meet the  requirements of Sections 401,
403(b), 408, 408A, or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code.                         

     This Prospectus describes two variations of Contracts:  Contracts for which
Premiums  may vary in amount  and  frequency,  subject  to  certain  limitations
("Flexible  Premium  Contracts"),  and Contracts for which  Premiums may vary in
amount and frequency only in the first Contract Year ("One Year Flexible Premium
Contracts").  Both Contracts  provide for the accumulation of values on either a
variable  basis,  a fixed basis,  or both.  The Contracts  also provide  several
options for fixed annuity payments to begin on a future date.                   

     A Contract  Owner may  allocate  Premiums  designated  to  accumulate  on a
variable basis to one or more of the Investment  Accounts of a separate  account
of AUL. The separate  account is named the AUL  American  Individual  Unit Trust
(the  "Variable  Account").  Each  Investment  Account of the  Variable  Account
invests in shares of one of the following mutual fund portfolios:               

OneAmerica Asset Director                    Fidelity(R) VIP Contrafund(R)      
OneAmerica Investment Grade Bond             Fidelity(R) VIP Equity-Income      
OneAmerica Money Market                      Fidelity(R) VIP Growth             
OneAmerica Value                             Fidelity(R) VIP High Income        
Alger American Growth                        Fidelity(R) VIP Index 500          
American Century(R) VP Capital Appreciation  Fidelity(R) VIP Overseas           
American Century(R) VP International         PBHG Insurance Series Growth II    
Calvert Social Mid Cap Growth                PBHG Insurance Series Technology   
                                & Communications
Fidelity(R) VIP Asset Manager(SM)            T. Rowe Price Equity Income        

     Premiums  allocated to an Investment  Account of the Variable  Account will
increase or decrease in dollar value depending on the investment  performance of
the corresponding mutual fund portfolio in which the Investment Account invests.
These  amounts are not  guaranteed.  In the  alternative,  a Contract  Owner may
allocate Premiums to AUL's Fixed Account. Such allocations will earn interest at
rates that are paid by AUL as described in "The Fixed Account."                 

     This Prospectus  concisely sets forth  information  about the Contracts and
the Variable Account that a prospective  investor should know before  investing.
Certain  additional  information  is  contained in a  "Statement  of  Additional
Information," dated March 25, 2005, which has been filed with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC").  The Statement of Additional  Information  is
incorporated  by reference  into this  Prospectus.  A  prospective  investor may
obtain a copy of the  Statement  of  Additional  Information  without  charge by
calling or writing to AUL at the telephone number or address  indicated above. A
postage pre-paid envelope is provided for this purpose. The table of contents of
the  Statement  of  Additional  Information  is  located  at  the  end  of  this
Prospectus.                                                                     

     Neither the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  nor any state  securities
commission has approved or  disapproved  of these  securities or passed upon the
adequacy or accuracy of the prospectus.  Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offense.                                                               

     This prospectus  should be accompanied by the current  prospectuses for the
fund or funds  being  considered.  Each of  these  prospectuses  should  be read
carefully and retained for future reference.                                    

   The date of this Prospectus is March 25, 2005

 SUMMARY

     This  summary  is  intended  to  provide  a  brief  overview  of  the  more
significant  aspects of the Contracts.  Later sections of this  Prospectus,  the
Statement of Additional  Information,  and the Contracts provide further detail.
Unless the context indicates  otherwise,  the discussion in this summary and the
remainder of the  Prospectus  relates to the portion of the Contracts  involving
the Variable Account.  The pertinent Contract and "The Fixed Account" section of
this Prospectus briefly describe the Fixed Account.                             

PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACTS 

     AUL  offers  the  individual   variable  annuity  contracts   ("Contracts")
described in this  Prospectus  for use in connection  with taxable  contribution
retirement plans and deferred  compensation plans for individuals  (collectively
"non-Qualified  Plans"). AUL also offers the Contracts for use by individuals in
connection  with  retirement  plans that meet the  requirements of Sections 401,
403(b),  457, 408, or 408A of the Internal  Revenue  Code,  allowing for pre-tax
contributions  (collectively  "Qualified  Plans").  While a  Contract  Owner may
benefit from tax deferral  under a Qualified  Plan without the use of a variable
annuity  contract,  variable  annuities may provide  additional  investment  and
insurance or annuity-related  benefits to individual Contract Owners. A variable
annuity contract  presents a dynamic concept in retirement  planning designed to
give Contract  Owners  flexibility  in attaining  investment  goals.  A Contract
provides for the  accumulation  of values on a variable basis, a fixed basis, or
both,  and  provides  several  options for fixed  annuity  payments.  During the
Accumulation  Period,  a Contract  Owner can  allocate  Premiums  to the various
Investment  Accounts of the Variable  Account or to the Fixed Account.  See "The
Contracts."

TYPES OF CONTRACTS 

     AUL  offers  two  variations  of  contracts  that  are  described  in  this
Prospectus. With Flexible Premium Contracts, Premium payments may vary in amount
and  frequency,  subject  to the  limitations  described  below.  With  One Year
Flexible  Premium  Contracts,  Premium payments may vary in amount and frequency
only during the first Contract Year.  Premium payments may not be made after the
first Contract Year.                                                            

THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT AND THE FUNDS 

     AUL will allocate Premiums  designated to accumulate on a variable basis to
the Variable Account.  See "Variable Account." The Variable Account is currently
divided into  subaccounts  referred to as Investment  Accounts.  Each Investment
Account invests  exclusively in shares of one of the portfolios of the following
mutual funds:

     Each of the Funds has a different  investment  objective.  A Contract Owner
may allocate Premiums to one or more of the Investment  Accounts available under
a Contract. Premiums allocated to a particular Investment Account will increase 
or decrease in dollar value  depending  upon the  investment  performance of the
corresponding  mutual fund  portfolio in which the Investment  Account  invests.
These amounts are not  guaranteed.  The Contract Owner bears the investment risk
for amounts allocated to an Investment Account of the Variable Account.         

FIXED ACCOUNT 

     The Contract  Owner may allocate  Premiums to the Fixed  Account,  which is
part of AUL's  General  Account.  Amounts  allocated  to the Fixed  Account earn
interest at rates periodically  determined by AUL.  Generally,  any current rate
that exceeds the guaranteed rate will be effective for the Contract for a period
of at least  one year.  These  rates are  guaranteed  to be at least  equal to a
minimum  effective annual rate ranging from 1% to 4%, depending on the Contract.
See "The Fixed Account."

P-->49710th�Page�of�35TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
PREMIUMS 

     For Flexible  Premium  Contracts,  the Contract  Owner may vary Premiums in
amount and frequency.  The minimum  Premium  payment is $50. For the first three
Contract Years,  Premiums must total, on a cumulative  basis, at least $300 each
Contract Year. For One Year Flexible Premium  Contracts,  the Contract Owner may
pay Premiums only during the first Contract  Year.  The minimum  Premium is $500
with a minimum  total  first year  Premium of $5,000.  See  "Premiums  under the
Contracts."

TRANSFERS 

     A Contract  Owner may transfer his or her Variable  Account Value among the
available  Investment  Accounts  or to the Fixed  Account at any time during the
Accumulation  Period.  The Contract  Owner may transfer part of his or her Fixed
Account Value to one or more of the  available  Investment  Accounts  during the
Accumulation  Period,  subject to certain  restrictions.  The  minimum  transfer
amount from any one Investment Account or from the Fixed Account is $500. If the
Contract Value in an Investment Account or the Fixed Account prior to a transfer
is less than $500,  then the minimum  transfer  amount is the  Contract  Owner's
remaining Contract Value in that Account. If, after any transfer,  the remaining
Contract  Value in an  Investment  Account or in the Fixed Account would be less
than  $500,  then AUL will  treat  that  request  for a  transfer  of the entire
Contract Value in that Investment Account.                                      

     If we  determine  that the  transfers  made by or on  behalf of one or more
Owners are to the  disadvantage  of other Owners,  we may restrict the rights of
certain  Owners.  We also reserve the right to limit the size of  transfers  and
remaining  balances,  to limit the number and  frequency  of  transfers,  and to
discontinue telephone, interactive voice response or internet based transfers.  

     Amounts  transferred from the Fixed Account to an Investment Account cannot
exceed  20% of the  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value as of the  beginning  of that
Contract Year. See "Transfers of Account Value."

WITHDRAWALS 

     The Contract Owner may surrender the Contract or take a withdrawal from the
Contract  Value at any time before the Annuity Date.  Withdrawals  and surrender
are  subject  to  the  limitations  under  any  applicable  Qualified  Plan  and
applicable  law.  The minimum  withdrawal  amount is $200 for  Flexible  Premium
Contracts and $500 for One Year Flexible Premium Contracts.                     

     Certain  retirement  programs,  such as 403(b)  Programs,  are  subject  to
constraints on withdrawals and surrenders.  See "403(b)  Programs-Constraints on
Withdrawals."  See  "Cash  Withdrawals"  for  more  information,  including  the
possible charges and tax consequences of a surrender and withdrawals.           

THE DEATH BENEFIT 

     If a Contract  Owner dies during the  Accumulation  Period,  AUL will pay a
death  benefit to the  Beneficiary.  The amount of the death benefit is equal to
the Death  Proceeds.  A death benefit will not be payable if the Contract  Owner
dies on or after the Annuity Date,  except as may be provided  under the Annuity
Option elected. See "The Death Proceeds" and "Annuity Period."

CHARGES 

     AUL will deduct  certain  charges in  connection  with the operation of the
Contracts and the Variable  Account.  These charges include a withdrawal  charge
assessed upon  withdrawal or surrender,  a mortality and expense risk charge,  a
premium tax  charge,  and an  administrative  fee.  In  addition,  the Funds pay
investment  advisory fees and other expenses.  For further  information on these
charges and expenses, see "Charges and Deductions."

FREE LOOK PERIOD 

     The  Contract  Owner has the right to return  the  Contract  for any reason
within ten days of receipt (or a longer period if required by state law). If the
Contract Owner  exercises  this right,  AUL will treat the Contract as void from
its inception.  AUL will refund to the Contract Owner the greater of (1) Premium
payments,  or (2) the Contract  Value minus amounts  deducted for premium taxes.

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING 

     Owners may purchase  units of an  Investment  Account over a period of time
through the Dollar Cost  Averaging  ("DCA")  Program.  Under a DCA Program,  the
Owner  authorizes  AUL to transfer a specific  dollar amount from the OneAmerica
Money Market  Investment  Account into one or more other Investment  Accounts at
the unit values  determined  on the dates of the  transfers.  An Owner may elect
monthly,  quarterly,  semi-annual, or annual DCA transfers. These transfers will
continue  automatically until AUL receives notice to discontinue the Program, or
until  there is not  enough  money in the  OneAmerica  Money  Market  Investment
Account to continue the Program.  To participate in the program,  AUL requires a
minimum  transfer amount of $500, and a minimum deposit of $10,000.  For further
information, see the explanation under "Dollar Cost Averaging Program."

CONTACTING AUL 

     Individuals should direct all written requests, notices, and forms required
under these Contracts, and any questions or inquiries to AUL's Variable Products
Service Office shown in the front of this Prospectus.

EXAMPLE 

     The Example is intended  to help you compare the cost of  investing  in the
contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity  contracts.  These
costs include  contract owner  transaction  expenses,  contract  fees,  separate
account annual expenses, and Fund fees and expenses.                            

     The Example  assumes  that you invest  $10,000 in the contract for the time
periods indicated. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return
each  year and  assumes  the  maximum  fees and  expenses  of any of the  funds.
Although your actual costs may be higher or lower,  based on these  assumptions,
your costs would be:

INFORMATION ABOUT AUL, THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT, AND THE FUNDS

AMERICAN UNITED LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY(R) 

     AUL is a stock  insurance  company  existing under the laws of the State of
Indiana.  It was originally  incorporated as a fraternal  society on November 7,
1877, under the laws of the federal  government,  and reincorporated as a mutual
insurance  company  under the laws of the State of Indiana in 1933.  On December
17, 2000,  AUL converted  from a mutual life  insurance  company to a stock life
insurance  company  ultimately  controlled by a mutual holding company, American
United Mutual Insurance Holding Company ("MHC").                                

After  conversion,  the insurance  company issued voting stock to a newly-formed
stock holding company,  OneAmerica Financial Partners,  Inc. (the "Stock Holding
Company").  The Stock Holding Company may, at some future time,  offer shares of
its stock publicly or privately;  however, the MHC must always hold at least 51%
of the voting stock of the Stock Holding Company, which in turn owns 100% of the
voting  stock of AUL.  No plans  have been  formulated  to issue  any  shares of
capital  stock of the Stock  Holding  Company  at this time.  The Stock  Holding
Company issued $200 million  aggregate  principal  amount of its 7% senior notes
due 2033 in 2003.                                                               

AUL conducts a conventional life insurance and annuity business. At December 31,
2003, the OneAmerica  Financial  Partners,  Inc.  enterprise,  in which AUL is a
partner, had assets of $14,040.8 million and had equity of $1,161.1 million.    

     The principal underwriter for the Contracts is OneAmerica Securities, Inc.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of AUL. One America Securities,  Inc. is registered as
a broker-dealer with the SEC.                                                   

VARIABLE ACCOUNT 

     AUL  American  Individual  Unit Trust was  established  by AUL on April 14,
1994,  under  procedures  established  under Indiana law. The income,  gains, or
losses of the Variable  Account are credited to or charged against the assets of
the Variable  Account  without regard to other income,  gains, or losses of AUL.
Assets  in  the  Variable  Account   attributable  to  the  reserves  and  other
liabilities under the Contracts are not chargeable with liabilities arising from
any other  business  that AUL  conducts.  AUL owns the  assets  in the  Variable
Account and is required to maintain sufficient assets in the Variable Account to
meet all Variable Account  obligations under the Contracts.  AUL may transfer to
its General Account assets that exceed  anticipated  obligations of the Variable
Account.  All  obligations  arising under the  Contracts  are general  corporate
obligations of AUL. AUL may invest its own assets in the Variable  Account,  and
may  accumulate  in the Variable  Account  proceeds  from  Contract  charges and
investment results applicable to those assets.                                  

     The Variable Account is currently divided into sub-accounts  referred to as
Investment  Accounts.  Each Investment Account invests  exclusively in shares of
one of the Funds.  Premiums may be allocated to one or more Investment  Accounts
available  under  a  Contract.  AUL  may  in  the  future  establish  additional
Investment  Accounts  of  the  Variable  Account,  which  may  invest  in  other
securities, mutual funds, or investment vehicles.                               

     The Variable  Account is registered with the SEC as a unit investment trust
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). Registration with the
SEC does not involve  supervision by the SEC of the administration or investment
practices of the Variable Account or of AUL.                                    

THE FUNDS 

     Each of the Funds is a diversified,  open-end management investment company
commonly referred to as a mutual fund, or a portfolio thereof. Each of the Funds
is  registered  with the SEC  under  the 1940 Act.  Such  registration  does not
involve  supervision  by the SEC of the  investments  or investment  policies or
practices of the Fund. Each Fund has its own investment  objective or objectives
and policies.  The shares of a Fund are  purchased by AUL for the  corresponding
Investment  Account at the Fund's net asset value per share,  i.e.,  without any
sales load.  All dividends and capital gain  distributions  received from a Fund
are automatically  reinvested in such Fund at net asset value,  unless otherwise
instructed    by   AUL.   AUL   has   entered   into    agreements    with   the
Distributors/Advisors  of Alger Management,  Inc.,  American Century(R) Variable
Portfolios,  Inc.,  Calvert  Variable  Series,  Inc.,  Fidelity(R)  Investments,
Pilgrim Baxter & Associates,  and T. Rowe Price Equity Series,  Inc. under which
AUL has agreed to render certain services and to provide information about these
funds to its  Contract  Owners  and/or  Participants  who invest in these funds.
Under  these   agreements  and  for  providing  these  services,   AUL  receives
compensation  from the  Distributor/Advisor  of these  funds,  ranging from zero
basis  points  until a certain  level of Fund assets have been  purchased  to 25
basis points on the net average aggregate deposits made.                        

     The  investment  advisors of the Funds are identified on page 6. All of the
investment advisors are registered with the SEC as investment advisors.         

     A  summary  of the  investment  objective  or  objectives  of each  Fund is
provided  below.  There  can be no  assurance  that any Fund  will  achieve  its
objective  or  objectives.   More  detailed  information  is  contained  in  the
Prospectus for the Funds, including information on the risks associated with the
investments and investment techniques of each Fund.

GENERAL

 PREMIUMS AND CONTRACT VALUES DURING THE ACCUMULATION PERIOD

APPLICATION FOR A CONTRACT 

     Any person or, in the case of Qualified Plans, any qualified  organization,
wishing to purchase a Contract must submit an application and an initial Premium
to AUL,  and provide any other form or  information  that AUL may  require.  AUL
reserves the right to reject an application  or Premium for any reason,  subject
to AUL's underwriting standards and guidelines.                                 

PREMIUMS UNDER THE CONTRACTS 

     Premium payments under Flexible  Premium  Contracts may be made at any time
during  the  Contract  Owner's  life and  before the  Contract's  Annuity  Date.
Premiums for Flexible  Premium  Contracts  may vary in amount and  frequency but
each Premium  payment must be at least $50.  Premiums must accumulate a total of
at least $300 each Contract Year for the first three  Contract  Years.  Premiums
may not total more than $12,000 in any one Contract Year unless otherwise agreed
to by AUL.                                                                      

     For One Year Flexible  Premium  Contracts,  Premiums may vary in amount and
frequency except that additional Premiums will only be accepted during the first
Contract Year.  Each such Premium  payment must be at least $500;  Premiums must
total at least $5,000 in the first  Contract  Year for  non-qualified  plans and
$2,000 in the first Contract Year for qualified plans, and all Premiums combined
may not exceed $1,000,000 unless otherwise agreed to by AUL.                    

     If the minimum Premium amounts under Flexible  Premium or One Year Flexible
Premium  Contracts  are not met, AUL may,  after 60 days notice,  terminate  the
Contract  and pay an  amount  equal to the  Contract  Value  as of the  close of
business  on the  effective  date of  termination.  AUL may change  the  minimum
Premiums permitted under a Contract,  and may waive any minimum required Premium
at its discretion.                                                              

     Annual Premiums under any Contract purchased in connection with a Qualified
Plan will be subject to maximum limits imposed by the Internal  Revenue Code and
possibly by the terms of the  Qualified  Plan.  See the  Statement of Additional
Information for a discussion of these limits or consult the pertinent  Qualified
Plan document. Such limits may change without notice.                           

     Initial  Premiums  must be  credited to a Contract no later than the end of
the second  Business Day after it is received by AUL at its Home Office if it is
preceded  or  accompanied  by a  completed  application  that  contains  all the
information  necessary  for issuing the  Contract  and  properly  crediting  the
Premium.  If AUL does not  receive a complete  application,  AUL will notify the
applicant that AUL does not have the necessary  information to issue a Contract.
If the  necessary  information  is not provided to AUL within five Business Days
after the Business Day on which AUL first receives an initial  Premium or if AUL
determines  it cannot  otherwise  issue a Contract,  AUL will return the initial
Premium to the  applicant,  unless  consent is  received  to retain the  initial
Premium until the application is made complete.                                 

     Subsequent  Premiums  (other than initial  Premiums) are credited as of the
end of the  Valuation  Period  in  which  they are  received  by AUL at its Home
Office.                                                                         

FREE LOOK PERIOD 

     The Owner has the right to return the  Contract  for any reason  within the
Free Look Period which is a ten day period beginning when the Owner receives the
Contract.  If a  particular  state  requires  a longer  Free Look  Period,  then
eligible  Owners in that state will be allowed  the longer  statutory  period to
return the  Contract.  The  returned  Contract  will be deemed void and AUL will
refund the greater of (1) Premium  payments or (2) the Contract  Value as of the
end of the Valuation Period in which AUL receives the Contract.                 

ALLOCATION OF PREMIUMS 

     Initial  Premiums will be allocated  among the  Investment  Accounts of the
Variable  Account or to the Fixed Account as  instructed by the Contract  Owner.
Allocation  to the  Investment  Accounts  and the Fixed  Account must be made in
increments of 1%.                                                               

     A  Contract  Owner may change the  allocation  instructions  at any time by
giving Proper Notice of the change to AUL at its Home Office and such allocation
will  continue  in  effect  until  subsequently  changed.  Any  such  change  in
allocation  instructions  will  be  effective  upon  receipt  of the  change  in

17

P-->49721st�Page�of�35TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
allocation  instructions by AUL at its Home Office. Changes in the allocation of
future Premiums have no effect on Premiums that have already been applied.  Such
amounts,  however,  may be  transferred  among the  Investment  Accounts  of the
Variable  Account or the Fixed Account in the manner  described in "Transfers of
Account Value."

TRANSFERS OF ACCOUNT VALUE 

     All or part of an  Owner's  Contract  Value  may be  transferred  among the
Investment  Accounts of the Variable Account or to the Fixed Account at any time
during the  Accumulation  Period upon receipt of a proper written request by AUL
at its Home  Office.  The minimum  amount that may be  transferred  from any one
Investment Account is $500 or, if less than $500, the Owner's remaining Contract
Value in the Investment Account, provided however, that amounts transferred from
the Fixed Account to an Investment Account during any given Contract Year cannot
exceed  20% of the  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value as of the  beginning  of that
Contract Year. If, after any transfer,  the Owner's remaining  Contract Value in
an Investment Account or in the Fixed Account would be less than $500, then such
request  will be treated  as a request  for a  transfer  of the entire  Contract
Value.                                                                          

     Currently,  there are no  limitations  on the number of  transfers  between
Investment  Accounts  available  under  a  Contract  or the  Fixed  Account.  In
addition,  no charges are  currently  imposed upon  transfers.  AUL reserves the
right,  however,  at a future  date,  to change the  limitation  on the  minimum
transfer, to assess transfer charges, to change the limit on remaining balances,
to limit the number and  frequency  of  transfers,  and to suspend any  transfer
privileges.  If we determine  that the transfers  made by or on behalf of one or
more Owners are to the  disadvantage of other Owners,  the transfer right may be
restricted.  We also  reserve  the  right to limit  the  size of  transfers  and
remaining  balances,  to limit the number and  frequency  of  transfers,  and to
discontinue  telephone,  interactive voice response or internet based transfers.
Any  transfer  from an  Investment  Account  of the  Variable  Account  shall be
effected as of the end of the  Valuation  Date in which AUL receives the request
in proper form.  AUL has  established  procedures  to confirm that  instructions
communicated by telephone or via the internet are genuine, which include the use
of personal identification numbers and recorded telephone calls. Neither AUL nor
its agents  will be liable for acting upon  instructions  believed by AUL or its
agents to be genuine, provided AUL has complied with its procedures.            

     Part of a Contract Owner's Fixed Account Value may be transferred to one or
more Investment  Accounts of the Variable Account during the Accumulation Period
subject to certain limitations as described in "The Fixed Account."

ABUSIVE TRADING PRACTICES 

LATE TRADING 

     Some investors attempt to profit from trading in Investment  Accounts after
the close of the  market,  but before the  Variable  Account has  actually  been
priced.  Because the market has closed, these investors have actual knowledge of
the price of the  securities  prior to its  calculation.  They  are,  therefore,
executing trades with information that was not readily  available to the market,
thereby   benefiting   financially   to  the   detriment  of  other  Owners  and
Participants.                                                                   

     AUL prohibits late trading in its Investment Accounts. The Variable Account
dates and time  stamps all trades  from  whatever  source and allows  only those
trades  received  prior to the close of the  market to  receive  that day's unit
value.  All  trades  received  after  this  point  will  receive  the next day's
calculated unit value.                                                          

MARKET  TIMING 

     Some  investors  attempt to profit  from  various  short-term  or  frequent
trading  strategies  commonly  known as market timing.  Excessive  purchases and
redemptions  disrupt  underlying  portfolio  management,  hurt  underlying  fund
performance and drive underlying fund expenses higher.  These costs are borne by
all Owners, including long-term investors who do not generate these costs.      

     AUL  discourages  market  timing and  excessive  trading.  If you intend to
engage in such practices,  do not invest in the Variable  Account.  AUL reserves
the right to reject any request to purchase or redeem units which it  reasonably
determines  to be in connection  with market  timing or excessive  trading by an
investor or by accounts of investors under common control (for example,  related
contract owners, or a financial advisor with discretionary trading authority for
multiple accounts).                                                             

     AUL does not always know and cannot always  reasonably detect such trading.
AUL's policies and procedures  only address market timing after the fact and are
not  prophylactic  measures;  they will only prevent market timing going forward
once  discovered.  However,  AUL does monitor for  excessive  short term trading
within its separate accounts. A report is run daily to identify,  at the omnibus
level,  net  trades by  Investment  Account.  Omnibus  trades  in an  individual
Investment  Account that exceed a certain  dollar amount or percentage of assets
will  identify   potential  abusive  trading.   The  dollar  amounts  and  asset
percentages  are  determined  by a market  timing task force,  and are  enforced
against all  participants/policyholders  consistently.  Once a possible abuse is
flagged,  the  individual  trades  for the  previous  ten days are  reviewed  to
determine if a similar trade amount was executed in the opposite  direction over
that period.                                                                    

     If a  purchase/redemption  match is found,  then the  blotters  for the two
trade dates are analyzed to determine if the same  policyholder/participant  has
ordered the  purchase  and  redemption.  If an  individual  is  identified,  the
administrative  area is notified.  Policyholder/participant  trading  history is
reviewed to  determine  if the trading  activity  is indeed  abusive  short term
trading.  This  procedure  is enforced  against  all  participants/policyholders
consistently.                                                                   

     In the case of an Individual  policy,  if it is determined that the trading
activity   violates  AUL's  policy,   then  the   policyholder  is  notified  of
restrictions  on their  account.  The  policyholder's  access  to  internet  and
interactive  voice  response  trades are  turned  off and they are  limited to a
specific  number of trades per  month,  as  determined  by the Task  Force.  The
threshold   established  by  the  Task  Force  will  be  enforced   against  all
policyholders/participants   consistently.   While  these  procedures  are  only
triggered  in the  event  that the  omnibus  level  limit is met,  there  are no
exceptions to these procedures and they are followed  uniformly once the omnibus
level triggers are met.                                                         

     In the case of group  variable  annuities,  the plan sponsor is notified of
the trading  activity and encouraged to communicate to the  participant to cease
and desist the activity in question. If the activity continues, the participants
trading  privileges may be restricted,  as described  above.  As with Individual
policies,  while  these  procedures  are only  triggered  in the event  that the
omnibus level limit is met, there are no exceptions to these procedures and they
are followed uniformly once the omnibus level triggers are met.                 

     AUL will not enter into any  agreement  with any  individual,  corporation,
Plan or other  entity that would  permit  such  activity  for that entity  while
discouraging it for other Owners.                                               

     Some funds may  charge a  redemption  fee for short  term  trading in their
fund.  Furthermore,  some funds monitor trading at the omnibus level and enforce
their own policies and procedures  based on suspected  abusive  trading.  Please
consult the funds'  prospectus  for more details.  AUL will cooperate and assist
the fund in enforcing any fund specific policies and procedures.                

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAM 

     Owners who wish to purchase units of an Investment Account over a period of
time may do so through the Dollar Cost Averaging ("DCA") Program.  The theory of
dollar  cost  averaging  is that  greater  numbers  of  Accumulation  Units  are
purchased at times when the unit prices are  relatively  low than are  purchased
when the prices are higher.  This has the  effect,  when  purchases  are made at
different  prices,  of reducing the aggregate average cost per Accumulation Unit
to less than the average of the  Accumulation  Unit prices on the same  purchase
dates.  However,  participation  in the Dollar Cost  Averaging  Program does not
assure a Contract Owner of greater profits from the purchases under the Program,
nor will it prevent or necessarily  alleviate losses in a declining market.  For
example,  assume  that a  Contract  Owner  requests  that  $1,000  per  month be
transferred from the OneAmerica Money

Market Investment  Account ("MMIA") to the OneAmerica Value Investment  Account.
The following  table  illustrates the effect of dollar cost averaging over a six
month period.                                                                   

                                                                [Download Table]

              Transfer          Unit            Units  
Month          Amount           Value         Purchased
-----          ------           -----         ---------

                                                       
  1            $1,000            $20             50    
  2            $1,000            $25             40    
  3            $1,000            $30             33.333
  4            $1,000            $40             25    
  5            $1,000            $35             28.571
  6            $1,000            $30             33.333

The average  price per unit for these  purchases is the sum of the prices ($180)
divided by the number of monthly  transfers  (6) or $30.  The  average  cost per
Accumulation Unit for these purchases is the total amount  transferred  ($6,000)
divided by the total number of Accumulation Units purchased (210.237) or $28.54.
THIS TABLE IS FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE
RESULTS.                                                                        

     Under a DCA Program,  the owner  deposits  Premiums  into the MMIA and then
authorizes  AUL to transfer a specific  dollar  amount from the MMIA into one or
more other Investment Accounts at the unit values determined on the dates of the
transfers.  This may be done  monthly,  quarterly,  semi-annually,  or annually.
These  transfers  will  continue  automatically  until  AUL  receives  notice to
discontinue  the  Program,  or until  there is not  enough  money in the MMIA to
continue the Program, whichever occurs first.                                   

     Currently,  the minimum required amount of each transfer is $500,  although
AUL  reserves the right to change this  minimum  transfer  amount in the future.
Transfers to or from the Fixed Account are not  permitted  under the Dollar Cost
Averaging Program. At least seven days advance written notice to AUL is required
before the date of the first proposed transfer under the DCA Program. AUL offers
the  Dollar  Cost  Averaging  Program  to  Contract  Owners at no charge and the
Company reserves the right to temporarily discontinue,  terminate, or change the
Program at any time.  Contract  Owners may change  the  frequency  of  scheduled
transfers, or may increase or decrease the amount of scheduled transfers, or may
discontinue participation in the Program at any time by providing written notice
to AUL,  provided that AUL must receive written notice of such a change at least
five days before a previously scheduled transfer is to occur.                   

     Contract Owners may initially elect to participate in the DCA Program,  and
if this  election is made at the time the  Contract is applied  for, the Program
will  take  effect  on the  first  monthly,  quarterly,  semi-annual,  or annual
transfer  date  following  the Premium  receipt by AUL at its Home  Office.  The
Contract Owner may select the  particular  date of the month,  quarter,  or year
that the  transfers  are to be made and such  transfers  will  automatically  be
performed on such date,  provided  that such date  selected is a day that AUL is
open for business and provided  further that such date is a Valuation  Date.  If
the date  selected is not a Business  Day or is not a Valuation  Date,  then the
transfer will be made on the next  succeeding  Valuation Date. To participate in
the Program, a minimum deposit of $10,000 is required.                          

CONTRACT OWNER'S VARIABLE ACCOUNT VALUE 

ACCUMULATION UNITS 

     Premiums  allocated to the Investment  Accounts  available under a Contract
are credited to the Contract in the form of  Accumulation  Units.  The number of
Accumulation  Units to be credited is  determined  by dividing the dollar amount
allocated to the particular  Investment  Account by the Accumulation  Unit value
for the particular  Investment  Account as of the end of the Valuation Period in
which the Premium is credited.  The number of Accumulation  Units so credited to
the  Contract  shall not be  changed by a  subsequent  change in the value of an
Accumulation  Unit, but the dollar value of an  Accumulation  Unit may vary from
Valuation Date to Valuation Date depending upon the investment experience of the
Investment Account and charges against the Investment Account.                  

ACCUMULATION UNIT VALUE 

     AUL determines the Accumulation  Unit value for each Investment  Account of
the Variable Account on each Valuation Date. The Accumulation Unit value for the
MMIA was initially set at $1 and $5 for each of the other  Investment  Accounts.
Subsequently,  on each  Valuation  Date,  the  Accumulation  Unit value for each
Investment  Account is  determined  by  multiplying  the Net  Investment  Factor
determined as of the end of the  Valuation  Date for the  particular  Investment
Account  by the  Accumulation  Unit value for the  Investment  Account as of the
immediately  preceding  Valuation  Period.  The Accumulation Unit value for each
Investment  Account may increase,  decrease,  or remain the same from  Valuation
Period to Valuation Period in accordance with the Net Investment Factor.        

NET INVESTMENT FACTOR 

     The Net Investment Factor is used to measure the investment  performance of
an Investment  Account from one Valuation Period to the next. For any Investment
Account for a Valuation  Period,  the Net  Investment  Factor is  determined  by
dividing (a) by (b) and then subtracting (c) from the result where:             

(a)  is equal to:                                                     

          (1)  the net asset value per share of the Fund in which the Investment
               Account  invests,  determined  as of the  end  of  the  Valuation
Period, plus                                      

          (2)  the per share  amount of any dividend or other  distribution,  if
              any, paid by the Fund during the Valuation Period, plus or minus

          (3)  a credit  or  charge  with  respect  to  taxes,  if any,  paid or
               reserved by AUL during the Valuation  Period that are  determined
               by AUL to be  attributable  to the  operation  of the  Investment
               Account  (although no Federal income taxes are  applicable  under
    present law and no such charge is currently assessed);

     (b)  is the net asset value per share of the Fund  determined as of the end
of the preceding Valuation Period; and                      

     (c)  is a daily charge factor determined by AUL to reflect the fee assessed
          against the assets of the  Investment  Account for the  mortality  and
expense risk charge.

 CASH WITHDRAWALS AND THE DEATH PROCEEDS

CASH WITHDRAWALS 

     During the lifetime of the  Annuitant,  at any time before the Annuity Date
and  subject  to  the  limitations  under  any  applicable  Qualified  Plan  and
applicable  law, a Contract may be surrendered or a withdrawal may be taken from
a Contract. A surrender or withdrawal request will be effective as of the end of
the Valuation Date that a proper written  request in a form acceptable to AUL is
received by AUL at its Home Office.                                             

     A surrender of a Contract  Owner's  Variable Account Value will result in a
withdrawal payment equal to the Owner's Contract Value allocated to the Variable
Account as of the end of the Valuation  Period during which AUL receives  Proper
Notice,  minus any applicable  withdrawal  charge. A withdrawal may be requested
for a specified  percentage or dollar  amount of an Owner's  Contract  Value.  A
request  for a  withdrawal  will  result in a payment by AUL equal to the amount
specified in the withdrawal  request.  Upon payment,  the Owner's Contract Value
will be reduced by an amount equal to the payment and any applicable  withdrawal
charge. Requests for a withdrawal that would leave a Contract Value of less than
$5000 for a  non-qualified  One Year  Flexible  Premium  Contract  ($2,000 for a
qualified contract) and less than the required cumulative minimum for a Flexible
Premium Contract will be treated as a request for a surrender. AUL may change or
waive this provision at its discretion.                                         

     The minimum amount that may be withdrawn from a Contract  Owner's  Contract
Value is $200 for  Flexible  Premium  Contracts  and $500 for One Year  Flexible
Premium Contracts. If the remaining Contract Value is less than these amounts, a
request for a  withdrawal  will be treated as a surrender  of the  Contract.  In
addition,  the  Contracts may be issued in  connection  with certain  retirement
programs that are subject to constraints on withdrawals and surrenders.         

     The amount of a withdrawal  will be taken from the Investment  Accounts and
the  Fixed  Account  as  instructed,  and if the  Owner  does  not  specify,  in
proportion to the Owner's Contract Value in the various Investment  Accounts and
the Fixed Account.  A withdrawal will not be effected until proper  instructions
are received by AUL at its Home Office.                                         

     A surrender  or a  withdrawal  may result in the  deduction of a withdrawal
charge and may be subject to a premium tax charge for any tax on  Premiums  that
may be imposed by various  states.  See  "Premium  Tax  Charge." A surrender  or
withdrawal that results in receipt of proceeds by a Contract Owner may result in
receipt of taxable  income to the Contract Owner and, in some  instances,  a tax
penalty. In addition,  distributions under certain Qualified Plans may result in
a tax penalty.  See "Tax Penalty For All Annuity Contracts." Owners of Contracts
used in  connection  with a  Qualified  Plan  should  refer to the  terms of the
applicable   Qualified  Plan  for  any   limitations  or  restrictions  on  cash
withdrawals.  The tax  consequences  of a  surrender  or  withdrawal  under  the
Contracts should be carefully considered. See "Federal Tax Matters."

THE DEATH PROCEEDS 
     If a  Contract  Owner  dies at or after  age 76,  the  amount  of the Death
Proceeds is equal to the Contract  Owner's  Contract  Value as of the end of the
Valuation  Period  in which due  proof of death is  received  by AUL at its Home
Office.  If a Contract Owner or, as described  below, an Annuitant,  dies before
age 76, the Death  Proceeds will be the greater of the Contract  Value as of the
end of the  Valuation  Period  in which  due  proof of  death  and  instructions
regarding  payment are  received by AUL at its Home Office or the value given by
(a)-(b)-(c)+(d)  where:  (a) is the net Premiums;  (b) is any amounts  withdrawn
(including  any  withdrawal  charges)  prior to death;  (c) is the  annual  fees
assessed prior to death; and (d) is the interest earned on (a)-(b)-(c), credited
at an annual effective rate of 4% until the date of death.                      

DEATH OF THE OWNER 

     If the Contract  Owner dies before the Annuity Date and the  Beneficiary is
not the Contract Owner's  surviving  spouse,  the Death Proceeds will be paid to
the  Beneficiary.  Such Death  Proceeds  will be paid in a lump-sum,  unless the
Beneficiary  elects to have this value applied under a settlement  option.  If a
settlement  option is elected,  the Beneficiary  must be named the Annuitant and
payments must begin within one year of the Contract  Owner's  death.  The option
also must have payments  which are payable over the life of the  Beneficiary  or
over  a  period  which  does  not  extend  beyond  the  life  expectancy  of the
Beneficiary.                                                                    

     If the Contract  Owner dies before the Annuity Date and the  Beneficiary is
the Contract Owner's surviving spouse,  the surviving spouse will become the new
Contract  Owner.  The Contract will  continue  with its terms  unchanged and the
Contract  Owner's  spouse will assume all rights as Contract  Owner.  Within 120
days of the original  Contract  Owner's death,  the Contract  Owner's spouse may
elect to receive  the Death  Proceeds  or  withdraw  any of the  Contract  Value
without any early withdrawal charge. However,  depending upon the circumstances,
a tax penalty may be imposed upon such a withdrawal.                            

     Any  amount  payable  under a  Contract  will not be less than the  minimum
required by the law of the state where the Contract is delivered.               

DEATH OF THE ANNUITANT 

     If the Annuitant dies before the Annuity Date and the Annuitant is not also
the Contract  Owner,  then: (1) if the Contract Owner is not an individual,  the
Death Proceeds will be paid to the Contract  Owner in a lump-sum;  or (2) if the
Contract Owner is an  individual,  a new Annuitant may be named and the Contract
will  continue.  If a new  Annuitant  is  not  named  within  120  days  of  the
Annuitant's death, the Contract Value, less any withdrawal charges, will be paid
to the Contract Owner in a lump-sum.                                            

20

P-->49724th�Page�of�35TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
     Death  Proceeds  will be paid to the  Beneficiary  or  Contract  Owner,  as
appropriate, in a single sum or under one of the Annuity Options, as directed by
the Contract Owner or as elected by the  Beneficiary.  If the  Beneficiary is to
receive  annuity  payments  under an Annuity  Option,  there may be limits under
applicable law on the amount and duration of payments that the  Beneficiary  may
receive, and requirements respecting timing of payments. A tax advisor should be
consulted in considering payout options.                                        

PAYMENTS FROM THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT 

     Payment of an amount from the Variable Account  resulting from a surrender,
withdrawal,  transfer from an Owner's  Contract Value  allocated to the Variable
Account,  or payment of the Death  Proceeds,  normally will be made within seven
days from the date a proper  request is received at AUL's Home Office.  However,
AUL can  postpone  the  calculation  or  payment of such an amount to the extent
permitted  under  applicable  law, which is currently  permissible  only for any
period:  (a)  during  which the New York  Stock  Exchange  is closed  other than
customary weekend and holiday closings; (b) during which trading on the New York
Stock  Exchange is  restricted,  as  determined  by the SEC; (c) during which an
emergency,  as  determined by the SEC,  exists as a result of which  disposal of
securities held by the Variable Account is not reasonably practicable,  or it is
not reasonably  practicable to determine the value of the assets of the Variable
Account;  or (d) for such other periods as the SEC may, by order, permit for the
protection of investors.  For information  concerning  payment of an amount from
the Fixed Account, see "The Fixed Account."

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS

PREMIUM TAX CHARGE 

     Various  states impose a tax on Premiums  received by insurance  companies.
Whether or not a premium tax is imposed  will depend upon,  among other  things,
the  Owner's  state  of  residence,  the  Annuitant's  state of  residence,  the
insurance  tax laws,  and AUL's  status in a  particular  state.  AUL assesses a
premium tax charge to reimburse  itself for premium  taxes that it incurs.  This
charge will be deducted as premium  taxes are incurred by AUL,  which is usually
when an annuity is effected.  Premium tax rates currently range from 0% to 3.5%,
but are subject to change.                                                      

WITHDRAWAL CHARGE 

     No  deduction  for sales  charges  is made from  Premiums  for a  Contract.
However,  if a cash  withdrawal  is made or the Contract is  surrendered  by the
Owner,  then depending on the type of Contract,  a withdrawal  charge (which may
also be referred to as a contingent  deferred sales charge),  may be assessed by
AUL on the amount  withdrawn if the  Contract  has not been in  existence  for a
certain period of time. An amount  withdrawn  during a Contract Year referred to
as the Free  Withdrawal  Amount will not be subject to an  otherwise  applicable
withdrawal  charge.  The Free Withdrawal  Amount is 12% of the Contract Value at
the time of the first withdrawal in any Contract Year in which the withdrawal is
being  made.  Any  transfer  of  Contract  Value  from the Fixed  Account to the
Variable  Account  will  reduce  the  Free  Withdrawal   Amount  by  the  amount
transferred.  The chart below  illustrates  the amount of the withdrawal  charge
that applies to both  variations of Contracts  based on the number of years that
the Contract has been in existence.

     In no event will the  amount of any  withdrawal  charge,  when added to any
withdrawal  charges  previously  assessed  against any amount  withdrawn  from a
Contract,  exceed 8.5% of the total Premiums paid on a Flexible Premium Contract
or 8% of the total  Premiums paid on a One Year Flexible  Premium  Contract.  In
addition,  no withdrawal  charge will be imposed upon payment of Death  Proceeds
under the Contract.                                                             

     A withdrawal charge may be assessed upon annuitization of a Contract. For a
Flexible Premium Contract, no withdrawal charge will apply if the Contract is in
its fifth  Contract  Year or later and a life  annuity or  survivorship  annuity
option is selected.  For a One Year  Flexible  Premium  Contract,  no withdrawal
charge will apply if a life  annuity or  survivorship  option is selected and if
the Contract is in its fourth Contract Year or later and the fixed income option
for a period of 10 or more years is chosen.  Otherwise,  the  withdrawal  charge
will apply.                                                                     

     The withdrawal  charge will be used to recover certain expenses relating to
sales of the Contracts,  including commissions paid to sales personnel and other
promotional costs. AUL reserves the right to increase or decrease the withdrawal
charge  for any  Contracts  established  on or after the  effective  date of the
change,  but the  withdrawal  charge will not exceed 8.5% of the total  Premiums
paid on a Flexible  Premium  Contract or 8% of the total  Premiums paid on a One
Year Flexible Premium Contract.

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE 

     AUL deducts a daily charge from the assets of each  Investment  Account for
mortality  and expense  risks  assumed by AUL.  The charge is equal to an annual
rate of 1.25% of the average daily net assets of each Investment  Account.  This
amount is intended to compensate AUL for certain mortality and expense risks AUL
assumes in  offering  and  administering  the  Contracts  and in  operating  the
Variable Account.                                                               

     The  expense  risk is the risk that AUL's  actual  expenses  in issuing and
administering the Contracts and operating the Variable Account will be more than
the charges  assessed for such expenses.  The mortality risk borne by AUL is the
risk that the Annuitants,  as a group, will live longer than AUL's actuarial    
tables  predict.  AUL may  ultimately  realize a profit  from this charge to the
extent it is not needed to address mortality and  administrative  expenses,  but
AUL may realize a loss to the extent the charge is not  sufficient.  AUL may use
any  profit  derived  from this  charge for any lawful  purpose,  including  any
distribution expenses not covered by the withdrawal charge.                     

ANNUAL CONTRACT FEE 

     AUL deducts an Annual  Contract fee from each Owner's  Contract Value equal
to the lesser of 2.0% of the Contract Value or $30 per year. The fee is assessed
every  year  on a  Contract  if  the  Contract  is in  effect  on  the  Contract
Anniversary,  and is assessed only during the  Accumulation  Period.  The Annual
Contract fee is waived on each Contract  Anniversary when the Contract Value, at
the time the charge would otherwise have been imposed,  exceeds $50,000.  When a
Contract  Owner  annuitizes  or  surrenders  on any day  other  than a  Contract
Anniversary,  a pro rata portion of the charge for that portion of the year will
not be assessed. The charge is deducted  proportionately from the Contract Value
allocated  among the Investment  Accounts and the Fixed Account.  The purpose of
this fee is to reimburse AUL for the expenses  associated with administration of
the  Contracts  and  operation of the Variable  Account.  AUL does not expect to
profit from this fee.                                                           

OTHER CHARGES 

     AUL may charge the  Investment  Accounts  of the  Variable  Account for the
federal,  state, or local income taxes incurred by AUL that are  attributable to
the Variable  Account and its Investment  Accounts.  No such charge is currently
assessed.                                                                       

VARIATIONS IN CHARGES 

     AUL  may  reduce  or  waive  the  amount  of  the  withdrawal   charge  and
administrative charge for a Contract where the expenses associated with the sale
of the Contract or the  administrative  costs  associated  with the Contract are
reduced. For example, the withdrawal and/or administrative charge may be reduced
in connection  with  acquisition of the Contract in exchange for another annuity
contract  issued by AUL. AUL may also reduce or waive the withdrawal  charge and
administrative  charge on Contracts sold to the directors or employees of AUL or
any of its affiliates or to directors or any employees of any of the Funds.     

GUARANTEE OF CERTAIN CHARGES 

     AUL  guarantees  that the  mortality  and  expense  risk  charge  shall not
increase.  AUL may  increase  the Annual  Contract  fee,  but only to the extent
necessary  to  recover  the  expenses  associated  with  administration  of  the
Contracts and operations of the Variable Account.                               

EXPENSES OF THE FUNDS 

     Each Investment Account of the Variable Account purchases shares at the net
asset  value  of the  corresponding  Fund.  The net  asset  value  reflects  the
investment  advisory fee and other expenses that are deducted from the assets of
the Fund. The advisory fees and other expenses are not fixed or specified  under
the terms of the Contract and are described in the Funds' Prospectuses.         

ANNUITY PERIOD
GENERAL                                                                         

     On the Annuity Date, the adjusted  value of the Owner's  Contract Value may
be applied to provide an annuity under one of the options  described in "Annuity
Options." The adjusted value will be equal to the value of the Owner's  Contract
Value as of the  Annuity  Date,  reduced  by any  applicable  Premium or similar
taxes, and any applicable withdrawal charge. For a Flexible Premium Contract, no
withdrawal  charge will apply if the Contract is in its fifth  Contract  Year or
later and a life annuity or survivorship  annuity option is selected.  For a One
Year  Flexible  Premium  Contract,  no  withdrawal  charge  will apply if a life
annuity or survivorship annuity option is selected or if the Contract is in its 
fourth  Contract Year or later and the fixed income option for a period of 10 or
more years is chosen. Otherwise, the withdrawal charge will apply.              

     The Contracts  provide for three Annuity  Options,  any one of which may be
elected, except as otherwise noted. A lump-sum distribution may also be elected.
Other Annuity  Options may be available  upon request at the  discretion of AUL.
All Annuity  Options are fixed and the annuity  payments  are based upon annuity
rates that vary with the Annuity  Option  selected and the age of the  Annuitant
(as adjusted),  except that in the case of Option 1, age is not a consideration.
The  annuity  rates are based upon an assumed  interest  rate of 3%,  compounded
annually.  Generally,  if no  Annuity  Option has been  selected  for a Contract
Owner,  annuity  payments  will be made to the  Annuitant  under  Option  2. For
Contracts used in connection  with certain  Employee  Benefit Plans and employer
sponsored 403(b)  programs,  annuity payments to Contract Owners who are married
will be made under  Option 3, with the  Contract  Owner's  spouse as  contingent
Annuitant,  unless the Contract  Owner  otherwise  elects and obtains his or her
spouse's consent.                                                               

22

P-->49726th�Page�of�35TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
     Annuity  payments will begin as of the Annuity Date. Once annuity  payments
have commenced, a Contract Owner cannot surrender his or her annuity and receive
a lump-sum  settlement in lieu thereof and cannot change the Annuity Option. If,
under any option, monthly payments are less than $100 each, AUL has the right to
make either a lump-sum  settlement or to make larger payments on a less frequent
basis. AUL also reserves the right to change the minimum payment amount.        

     A Contract Owner may designate an Annuity Date, Annuity Option,  contingent
Annuitant,  and Beneficiary on an Annuity Election Form that must be received by
AUL at its  Home  Office  prior  to the  Annuity  Date.  AUL  may  also  require
additional  information before annuity payments commence.  If the Contract Owner
is an individual,  the Annuitant may be changed at any time prior to the Annuity
Date. The Annuitant  must also be an individual and must be the Contract  Owner,
or someone chosen from among the Contract  Owner's  spouse,  parents,  brothers,
sisters, and children.  Any other choice requires AUL's consent. If the Contract
Owner is not an  individual,  a change in the  Annuitant  will not be  permitted
without AUL's consent.  The Beneficiary,  if any, may be changed at any time and
the Annuity Date and Annuity Option may also be changed at any time prior to the
Annuity Date. For Contracts used in connection with a Qualified Plan,  reference
should  be made to the terms of the  Qualified  Plan for  pertinent  limitations
regarding annuity dates and options.  To help ensure timely receipt of the first
annuity payment, a transfer of a Contract Owner's Contract Value in the Variable
Account  should be made to the  Fixed  Account  at least two weeks  prior to the
Annuity Date.                                                                   

ANNUITY OPTIONS 

OPTION 1 - INCOME FOR A FIXED PERIOD 

     An annuity  payable  monthly for a fixed period (not more than 20 years) as
elected,  with the guarantee  that if, at the death of the  Annuitant,  payments
have been made for less than the selected fixed period, annuity payments will be
continued during the remainder of said period to the Beneficiary.               

OPTION 2 - LIFE ANNUITY 

     An annuity  payable  monthly during the lifetime of the Annuitant that ends
with the last  monthly  payment  before  the death of the  Annuitant.  A minimum
number of  payments  can be  guaranteed  such as 120 or the  number of  payments
required to refund the proceeds applied.                                        

OPTION 3 - SURVIVORSHIP ANNUITY 

     An annuity  payable monthly during the lifetime of the Annuitant and, after
the death of the Annuitant, an amount equal to 50%, or 100% (as specified in the
election) of such annuity, will be paid to the contingent Annuitant named in the
election if and so long as such contingent Annuitant lives.                     

     An  election  of this  option is  automatically  cancelled  if  either  the
Contract  Owner or the  contingent  Annuitant  dies  before  the  Annuity  Date.

SELECTION OF AN OPTION 
Contract  Owners  should  carefully  review the Annuity  Options with their
financial or tax  advisors.  For Contracts  used in connection  with a Qualified
Plan, reference should be made to the terms of the applicable Qualified Plan for
pertinent limitations  respecting the form of annuity payments, the commencement
of  distributions,  and other matters.  For instance,  annuity  payments under a
Qualified  Plan  generally must begin no later than April 1 of the calendar year
following the calendar  year in which the Contract  Owner reaches age 70 1/2 and
is no longer  employed.  For Option 1, the period elected for receipt of annuity
payments under the terms of the Annuity  Option  generally may be no longer than
the joint life  expectancy of the Annuitant and Beneficiary in the year that the
Annuitant reaches age 70 1/2 and must be shorter than such joint life expectancy
if the  Beneficiary  is not the  Annuitant's  spouse  and is more  than 10 years
younger than the Annuitant.  Under Option 3, if the contingent  Annuitant is not
the Annuitant's spouse and is more than 10 years younger than the Annuitant, the
100% election specified above may not be available.                             

 THE FIXED ACCOUNT

     Contributions  or  transfers  to the  Fixed  Account  become  part of AUL's
General Account. The General Account is subject to regulation and supervision by
the Indiana  Insurance  Department as well as the insurance laws and regulations
of other  jurisdictions in which the Contracts are  distributed.  In reliance on
certain  exemptive and exclusionary  provisions,  interests in the Fixed Account
have not been  registered as securities  under the  Securities  Act of 1933 (the
"1933  Act") and the Fixed  Account  has not been  registered  as an  investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Accordingly, neither the Fixed
Account nor any interests therein are generally subject to the provisions of the
1933 Act or the 1940 Act. AUL has been advised that the staff of the SEC has not
reviewed the disclosure in this Prospectus  relating to the Fixed Account.  This
disclosure,  however, may be subject to certain generally applicable  provisions
of the federal  securities  laws  relating to the accuracy and  completeness  of
statements  made in the  Prospectus.  This  Prospectus is generally  intended to
serve as a  disclosure  document  only for aspects of a Contract  involving  the
Variable  Account and contains  only  selected  information  regarding the Fixed
Account.  For more  information  regarding the Fixed  Account,  see the Contract
itself.                                                                         

INTEREST 

     A Contract  Owner's Fixed Account Value earns  interest at fixed rates that
are paid by AUL. The Account Value in the Fixed Account earns interest at one or
more interest rates  determined by AUL at its discretion and declared in advance

23

P-->49727th�Page�of�35TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
("Current  Rate"),  which are guaranteed to be at least an annual effective rate
of 3% ("Guaranteed  Rate"). AUL will determine a Current Rate from time to time,
and any Current  Rate that exceeds the  Guaranteed  Rate will be in effect for a
period of at least one year.  If AUL  determines a Current Rate in excess of the
Guaranteed  Rate,  Premiums  allocated or transfers to the Fixed Account under a
Contract  during the time the Current Rate is in effect are  guaranteed  to earn
interest at that particular Current Rate for at least one year.                 

     Amounts  contributed  or  transferred to the Fixed Account earn interest at
the Current Rate then in effect.  If AUL changes the Current Rate,  such amounts
contributed  or  transferred  on or after the effective  date of the change earn
interest at the new Current Rate;  however,  amounts  contributed or transferred
prior to the effective date of the change may earn interest at the prior Current
Rate or other  Current Rate  determined  by AUL.  Therefore,  at any given time,
various  portions  of a  Contract  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value may be earning
interest at different  Current  Rates for different  periods of time,  depending
upon when such portions were originally  contributed or transferred to the Fixed
Account. AUL bears the investment risk for Contract Owner's Fixed Account Values
and for paying  interest at the Current  Rate on amounts  allocated to the Fixed
Account.                                                                        

WITHDRAWALS 

     A Contract Owner may make a surrender or a withdrawal from his or her Fixed
Account  Value  subject to the  provisions  of the  Contract.  A surrender  of a
Contract  Owner's Fixed Account Value will result in a withdrawal  payment equal
to the  value of the  Contract  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value as of the day the
surrender is effected,  minus any applicable withdrawal charge. A withdrawal may
be requested for a specified percentage or dollar amount of the Contract Owner's
Fixed Account Value.  For a further  discussion of surrenders and withdrawals as
generally  applicable  to a Contract  Owner's  Variable  Account Value and Fixed
Account Value, see "Cash Withdrawals."

TRANSFERS 

     A Contract  Owner's Fixed Account Value may be  transferred  from the Fixed
Account to the  Variable  Account  subject to certain  limitations.  The minimum
amount that may be  transferred  from the Fixed Account is $500 or, if the Fixed
Account Value is less than $500, the Contract  Owner's  remaining  Fixed Account
Value.  If the amount  remaining in the Fixed Account after a transfer  would be
less than $500, the remaining  amount will be  transferred  with the amount that
has been  requested.  The  maximum  amount  that may be  transferred  in any one
Contract Year is the lesser of 20% of a Contract  Owner's Fixed Account Value as
of the last Contract Anniversary  preceding the request, or the Contract Owner's
entire  Fixed  Account  Value if it would be less than $500 after the  transfer.
Transfers  and  withdrawals  of a Contract  Owner's  Fixed Account Value will be
effected  on a  last-in  first-out  basis.  For a  discussion  of  transfers  as
generally  applicable  to a Contract  Owner's  Variable  Account Value and Fixed
Account Value, see "Transfers of Account Value."

CONTRACT CHARGES 

     The withdrawal charge will be the same for amounts surrendered or withdrawn
from a Contract  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value as for  amounts  surrendered  or
withdrawn  from a Contract  Owner's  Variable  Account Value.  In addition,  the
annual  fee  will be the  same  whether  or not an  Owner's  Contract  Value  is
allocated to the Variable Account or the Fixed Account. The charge for mortality
and  expense  risks will not be  assessed  against  the Fixed  Account,  and any
amounts  that AUL pays for income taxes  allocable to the Variable  Account will
not be charged against the Fixed Account.  In addition,  the investment advisory
fees and  operating  expenses  paid by the Funds  will not be paid  directly  or
indirectly by Contract  Owners to the extent the Contract  Value is allocated to
the Fixed Account;  however,  such Contract  Owners will not  participate in the
investment experience of the Variable Account. See "Charges and Deductions."

PAYMENTS FROM THE FIXED ACCOUNT 

     Surrenders,  withdrawals,  and transfers from the Fixed Account and payment
of Death  Proceeds  based upon a Contract  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value may be
delayed for up to six months after a written  request in proper form is received
by AUL at its Home  Office.  During  the  period of  deferral,  interest  at the
applicable  interest  rate or rates will continue to be credited to the Contract
Owner's Fixed Account Value.                                                    

MORE ABOUT THE CONTRACTS

DESIGNATION AND CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY 

     The Beneficiary  designation  contained in an application for the Contracts
will remain in effect until  changed.  The interests of a  Beneficiary  who dies
before the Contract  Owner will pass to any  surviving  Beneficiary,  unless the
Contract Owner specifies otherwise.  Unless otherwise provided, if no designated
Beneficiary  is living upon the death of the Contract Owner prior to the Annuity
Date, the Contract Owner's estate is the Beneficiary. Unless otherwise provided,
if no designated Beneficiary under an Annuity Option is living after the Annuity
Date,  upon the death of the  Annuitant,  the Owner is the  Beneficiary.  If the
Contract Owner is not an individual, the Contract Owner will be the Beneficiary.

     Subject  to  the  rights  of an  irrevocably  designated  Beneficiary,  the
designation  of a  Beneficiary  may be  changed or revoked at any time while the
Contract Owner is living by filing with AUL a written beneficiary designation or
revocation in such form as AUL may require. The change or revocation will not be
binding upon AUL until it is received by AUL at its Home  Office.  When it is so
received, the change or revocation will be effective as of the date on which the
beneficiary  designation or revocation was signed,  but the change or revocation
will be without                                                                 

24

P-->49728th�Page�of�35TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
prejudice  to AUL if any  payment  has been made or any action has been taken by
AUL prior to receiving the change or revocation.                                

     For Contracts issued in connection with Qualified  Plans,  reference should
be  made  to the  terms  of the  particular  Qualified  Plan,  if  any,  and any
applicable  law  for  any  restrictions  on  the  beneficiary  designation.  For
instance,  under an  Employee  Benefit  Plan,  the  Beneficiary  (or  contingent
Annuitant) must be the Contract Owner's spouse if the Contract Owner is married,
unless the spouse  properly  consents to the  designation  of a Beneficiary  (or
contingent Annuitant) other than the spouse.                                    

ASSIGNABILITY 

     A Contract  Owner may  assign a  Contract,  but the rights of the  Contract
Owner and any  Beneficiary  will be secondary to the  interests of the assignee.
AUL assumes no responsibility for the validity of an assignment.  Any assignment
will not be binding upon AUL until  received in writing at its Home  Office.  An
assignment  may be a taxable  event,  so Contract  Owners  should  consult a tax
advisor as to the tax consequences resulting from such an assignment.           

     However,  under certain  Qualified  Plans,  no benefit or privilege under a
Contract may be sold, assigned,  discounted, or pledged as collateral for a loan
or as security for the  performance of an obligation or for any other purpose to
any person or entity other than AUL.                                            

PROOF OF AGE AND SURVIVAL 

     AUL may require  proof of age, sex, or survival of any person on whose life
annuity payments depend.                                                        

MISSTATEMENTS 

     If the  age or  sex  of an  Annuitant  or  contingent  Annuitant  has  been
misstated,  the  correct  amount  paid or  payable  by AUL  shall be such as the
Contract would have provided for the correct age and sex.                       

ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PREMIUMS 

     AUL  reserves  the right to refuse to accept new Premiums for a Contract at
any time.                                                                       

 FEDERAL TAX MATTERS
INTRODUCTION                                                                    

     The  Contracts  described  in  this  Prospectus  are  designed  for  use in
connection with non-tax  qualified  retirement plans for individuals and for use
by  individuals  in connection  with  retirement  plans under the  provisions of
Sections 401,  403(b),  457, 408 or 408A of the Internal  Revenue Code ("Code").
The  ultimate  effect of federal  income  taxes on values  under a Contract,  on
annuity payments, and on the economic benefits to the Owner, the Annuitant,  and
the  Beneficiary or other payee,  may depend upon the type of Qualified Plan for
which  the  Contract  is  purchased  and a  number  of  different  factors.  The
discussion  contained  herein and in the Statement of Additional  Information is
general in nature.  It is based upon AUL's  understanding of the present federal
income  tax  laws as  currently  interpreted  by the  Internal  Revenue  Service
("IRS"),  and is not intended as tax advice. No representation is made regarding
the likelihood of  continuation of the present federal income tax laws or of the
current  interpretations  by the IRS.  Future  legislation  may  affect  annuity
contracts  adversely.  Moreover,  no attempt is made to consider any  applicable
state or other laws.  Because of the  inherent  complexity  of such laws and the
fact that tax results will vary according to the terms of the Qualified Plan and
the   particular   circumstances   of  the  individual   involved,   any  person
contemplating the purchase of a Contract,  or receiving annuity payments under a
Contract, should consult a qualified tax advisor.                               

AUL DOES NOT MAKE ANY GUARANTEE  REGARDING THE TAX STATUS OF ANY CONTRACT OR ANY
TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE CONTRACTS. CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR.                  

DIVERSIFICATION STANDARDS 

     Treasury Department  regulations under Section 817(h) of the Code prescribe
asset  diversification  requirements  which  are  expected  to  be  met  by  the
investment companies whose shares are sold to the Investment  Accounts.  Failure
to meet these requirements would jeopardize the tax status of the Contracts. See
the Statement of Additional Information for additional details.                 

     In   connection   with   the   issuance   of  the   regulations   governing
diversification  under  Section  817(h) of the  Code,  the  Treasury  Department
announced  that it would issue  future  regulations  or rulings  addressing  the
circumstances in which a variable contract owner's control of the investments of
a separate  account may cause the  contract  owner,  rather  than the  insurance
company, to be treated as the owner of the assets held by the separate account. 

     If the variable  contract  owner is considered  the owner of the securities
underlying the separate  account,  income and gains produced by those securities
would be included currently in a contract owner's gross income. It is not clear,
at present,  what these regulations or rulings may provide.  It is possible that
when the  regulations  or  rulings  are  issued,  the  Contracts  may need to be
modified  in order to remain  in  compliance.  AUL  intends  to make  reasonable
efforts to comply  with any such  regulations  or rulings so that the  Contracts
will be  treated as annuity  contracts  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  and
reserves  the  right  to make  such  changes  as it deems  appropriate  for that
purpose.

TAXATION OF ANNUITIES IN GENERAL - NON-QUALIFIED PLANS 

     Section  72 of the Code  governs  taxation  of  annuities.  In  general,  a
Contract  Owner is not taxed on  increases  in value  under an annuity  contract
until  some form of  distribution  is made  under  the  contract.  However,  the
increase in value may be subject to tax currently  under certain  circumstances.
See "Contracts Owned by Non-Natural Persons" and "Diversification Standards".   

1. Surrenders or Withdrawals Prior to the Annuity Date                      

     Code  Section  72  provides  that  amounts  received  upon a  surrender  or
withdrawal  from a contract  prior to the annuity date generally will be treated
as gross  income to the extent that the cash value of the  Contract  (determined
without regard to any surrender charge in the case of a withdrawal or surrender)
exceeds the  "investment  in the contract." In general,  the  "investment in the
contract" is that  portion,  if any, of Premiums  paid under a contract less any
distributions  received previously under the contract that are excluded from the
recipient's  gross income.  The taxable  portion is taxed at ordinary income tax
rates.  For  purposes  of this rule,  a pledge or  assignment  of a contract  is
treated  as a payment  received  on  account of a  withdrawal  from a  contract.
Similarly,  loans under a contract generally are treated as distributions  under
the contract.                                                                   

2. Surrenders or Withdrawals on or after the Annuity Date                 

     Upon  receipt of a lump-sum  payment,  the  recipient  is taxed if the Cash
Value of the contract exceeds the investment in the contract.                   

3. Amounts received as an Annuity                                         

     For amounts received as an Annuity,  the taxable portion of each payment is
determined by using a formula known as the "exclusion  ratio," which establishes
the ratio that the investment in the contract bears to the total expected amount
of annuity payments for the term of the contract.  That ratio is then applied to
each payment to determine the non-taxable portion of the payment. That remaining
portion of each payment is taxed at ordinary  income rates.  Once the excludible
portion of annuity  payments to date equals the investment in the contract,  the
balance of the annuity payments will be fully taxable.                          

     Withholding  of federal income taxes on all  distributions  may be required
unless a recipient who is eligible  elects not to have any amounts  withheld and
properly  notifies AUL of that  election.  Special rules apply to withholding on
distributions from Employee Benefit Plans and 403(b) arrangements.              

4. Penalty Tax on Certain Surrenders and Withdrawals                        

     With  respect to amounts  withdrawn  or  distributed  before the  recipient
reaches age 59 1/2, a penalty tax is imposed equal to 10% of the portion of such
amount which is  includible  in gross  income.  However,  the penalty tax is not
applicable to withdrawals: (1) made on or after the death of the owner (or where
the owner is not an  individual,  the death of the "primary  annuitant,"  who is
defined as the individual the events in whose life are of primary  importance in
affecting  the  timing  and  amount  of the  payout  under  the  contract);  (2)
attributable to the recipient's  becoming totally disabled within the meaning of
Code Section 72(m)(7);  or (3) which are part of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life
expectancy) of the recipient, or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of
the  recipient  and his  beneficiary.  The 10%  penalty  also  does not apply in
certain other circumstances described in Code Section 72.                       

     If the penalty tax does not apply to a surrender or  withdrawal as a result
of  the  application  of  item  (3)  above,  and  the  series  of  payments  are
subsequently modified (other than by reason of death or disability), the tax for
the first year in which the  modification  occurs will be increased by an amount
(determined in accordance with IRS regulations) equal to the tax that would have
been imposed but for item (3) above,  plus interest for the deferral period,  if
the  modification  takes place (a) before the close of the period  which is five
years from the date of the first payment and after the recipient  attains age 59
1/2, or (b) before the recipient reaches age 59 1/2.                            

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 

1. Distribution-at-Death Rules                                              

     In order to be treated as an annuity contract,  a contract must provide the
following two distribution  rules: (a) if the owner dies on or after the Annuity
Commencement  Date,  and before the entire  interest  in the  contract  has been
distributed,  the remaining  interest must be distributed at least as quickly as
the method in effect on the owner's death;  and (b) if the owner dies before the
Annuity Date, the entire  interest in the contract must generally be distributed
within  five  years  after the date of death,  or, if  payable  to a  designated
beneficiary, must be distributed over the life of that designated beneficiary or
over a period not  extending  beyond the life  expectancy  of that  beneficiary,
commencing  within  one  year  after  the date of  death  of the  owner.  If the
designated beneficiary is the spouse of the owner, the contract may be continued
in the name of the spouse as owner.                                             

     For purposes of determining the timing of distributions under the foregoing
rules, where the owner is not an individual, the primary annuitant is considered
the owner.  In that case, a change in the primary  annuitant  will be treated as
the  death  of  the  owner.   Finally,   in  the  case  of  joint  owners,   the
distribution-at-death  rules will be applied by treating  the death of the first
owner  as the  one  to be  taken  into  account  in  determining  how  generally
distributions  must commence,  unless the sole  surviving  owner is the deceased
owner's  spouse.  The  endorsement  that allows for joint  ownership  applies to
spouses only.

2. Gift of Annuity Contracts                                                

     Generally, gifts of contracts (not purchased in connection with a Qualified
Plan) before the Annuity  Commencement  Date will trigger income tax on the gain
on the  contract,  with the donee  getting  a  stepped-up  basis for the  amount
included  in the  donor's  income.  This  provision  does not  apply to  certain
transfers  incident  to a  divorce.  The  10%  penalty  tax  on  pre-age  59 1/2
withdrawals and distributions and gift tax also may be applicable.              

3. Contracts Owned by Non-Natural Persons                                   

     If the contract is held by a non-natural person (for example, a corporation
in connection with its non-tax qualified deferred  compensation plan) the income
on that  contract  (generally  the Account  Value less the Premium  payments) is
includible  in taxable  income each year.  Other taxes (such as the  alternative
minimum tax and the  environmental  tax imposed under Code Section 59A) may also
apply. The rule does not apply where the contract is acquired by the estate of a
decedent, where the contract is held by certain types of retirement plans, where
the contract is a qualified funding asset for structured settlements,  where the
contract is purchased on behalf of an employee upon  termination  of an Employee
Benefit Plan, and in the case of a so-called immediate annuity. Code Section 457
(deferred  compensation)  plans for employees of state and local governments and
tax-exempt organizations are not within the purview of the exceptions.  However,
the income of state and local governments and tax-exempt organizations generally
is exempt from federal income tax.                                              

4. Multiple Contract Rule                                                   

     For  purposes  of  determining  the amount of any  distribution  under Code
Section 72(e)  (amounts not received as  annuities)  that is includable in gross
income,  all annuity  contracts  issued by the same insurer to the same contract
owner during any calendar year must be  aggregated  and treated as one contract.
Thus,  any  amount  received  under any such  contract  prior to the  contract's
Annuity  Commencement  Date,  such as a withdrawal,  dividend,  or loan, will be
taxable  (and  possibly  subject  to the 10%  penalty  tax) to the extent of the
combined income in all such contracts.  In addition, the Treasury Department has
broad  regulatory  authority in applying this provision to prevent  avoidance of
the purposes of this new rule.                                                  

QUALIFIED PLANS 

     The Contract may be used with certain types of Qualified Plans as described
under  "The  Contracts."  The  tax  rules  applicable  to  participants  in such
Qualified  Plans vary according to the type of plan and the terms and conditions
of the plan  itself.  No attempt is made  herein to  provide  more than  general
information  about the use of the Contract  with the various  types of Qualified
Plans. Contract Owners,  Annuitants,  and Beneficiaries,  are cautioned that the
rights of any person to any benefits under such Qualified  Plans will be subject
to the terms  and  conditions  of the plans  themselves  and may be  limited  by
applicable law, regardless of the terms and conditions of the Contract issued in
connection therewith.  For example, AUL may accept beneficiary  designations and
payment  instructions  under the  terms of the  Contract  without  regard to any
spousal consents that may be required under the Code or the Employee  Retirement
Income  Securities  Act of 1974  ("ERISA").  Consequently,  a  Contract  Owner's
Beneficiary designation or elected payment option may not be enforceable.       

   The  following  are brief  descriptions  of the various  types of Qualified
Plans and the use of the Contract therewith:                                    

1. Individual Retirement Annuities                                          

     Code  Section  408  permits an  eligible  individual  to  contribute  to an
individual  retirement  program  through the purchase of  Individual  Retirement
Annuities ("IRAs"). The Contract may be purchased as an IRA. IRAs are subject to
limitations  on the  amount  that may be  contributed,  the  persons  who may be
eligible,  and on the time when distributions must commence.  Depending upon the
circumstances  of the  individual,  contributions  to an IRA  may be  made  on a
deductible or non-deductible basis. IRAs may not be transferred, sold, assigned,
discounted, or pledged as collateral for a loan or other obligation.  The annual
Premium for an IRA may not exceed $3,000.  Any refund of Premium must be applied
to payment  of future  Premiums  or the  purchase  of  additional  benefits.  In
addition,  distributions  from  certain  other types of  Qualified  Plans may be
placed on a tax-deferred basis into an IRA.                                     

2. Roth IRA                                                                 

     Effective  January 1, 1998, a Roth IRA under Code Section 408A is available
for retirement  savings for individuals with earned income.  The Contract may be
purchased  as  a  Roth  IRA.   Roth  IRA  allows  an  individual  to  contribute
non-deductible  contributions for retirement purposes,  with the earnings income
tax-deferred,  and the potential  ability to withdraw the money income  tax-free
under certain circumstances.  Roth IRAs are subject to limitations on the amount
that may be  contributed,  the  persons who may be  eligible,  and the time when
distributions must commence.  Roth IRAs may not be transferred,  sold, assigned,
discounted, or pledged as collateral for a loan or other obligation.  The annual
Premium  for a  Roth  IRA  may  not  exceed  a  certain  limit,  reduced  by any
contribution  to that  individual's  IRA. In  addition,  a taxpayer may elect to
convert an IRA to a Roth IRA,  accelerating  deferred  income  taxes on previous
earnings in the IRA to a current year.                                          

3. Corporate Pension and Profit Sharing Plans                               

     Code Section 401(a) permits corporate  employers to establish various types
of  retirement  plans  for  their  employees.  For this  purpose,  self-employed
individuals  (proprietors or partners operating a trade or business) are        

27

P-->49731st�Page�of�35TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
treated as employees  eligible to  participate  in such plans.  Such  retirement
plans may permit the purchase of Contracts to provide benefits thereunder.      

     In order for a retirement plan to be "qualified" under Code Section 401, it
must: (1) meet certain minimum standards with respect to participation, coverage
and vesting;  (2) not discriminate in favor of "highly  compensated"  employees;
(3) provide  contributions  or benefits that do not exceed certain  limitations;
(4)  prohibit  the use of plan  assets for  purposes  other  than the  exclusive
benefit  of the  employees  and their  beneficiaries  covered  by the plan;  (5)
provide  for  distributions  that  comply  with  certain  minimum   distribution
requirements;  (6) provide for certain spousal survivor benefits; and (7) comply
with numerous other qualification requirements.                                 

     A  retirement  plan  qualified  under  Code  Section  401 may be  funded by
employer  contributions,  employee  contributions or a combination of both. Plan
participants are not subject to tax on employer contributions until such amounts
are  actually  distributed  from  the  plan.  Depending  upon  the  terms of the
particular plan,  employee  contributions  may be made on a pre-tax or after-tax
basis. In addition,  plan  participants  are not taxed on plan earnings  derived
from  either  employer  or  employee   contributions  until  such  earnings  are
distributed.                                                                    

4. Tax-Deferred Annuities                                                   

     Section 403(b) of the Code permits the purchase of "tax-deferred annuities"
by public schools and organizations  described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code,
including certain charitable,  educational and scientific  organizations.  These
qualifying  employers  may pay Premiums  under the  Contracts for the benefit of
their  employees.  Such  Premiums are not  includable in the gross income of the
employee until the employee receives distributions from the Contract. The amount
of Premiums to the  tax-deferred  annuity is limited to certain maximums imposed
by the Code. Furthermore,  the Code sets forth additional restrictions governing
such items as transferability, distributions, nondiscrimination and withdrawals.
Any employee  should  obtain  competent  tax advice as to the tax  treatment and
suitability of such an investment.                                              

5.  Deferred Compensation Plans                                             

     Section 457 of the Code permits  employees  of state and local  governments
and units and  agencies  of state and local  governments  as well as  tax-exempt
organizations  described in Section  501(c)(3) of the Code to defer a portion of
their compensation  without paying current taxes.  Distributions  received by an
employee from a 457 Plan will be taxed as ordinary income.                      

QUALIFIED PLAN FEDERAL TAXATION SUMMARY 

     The  above  description  of the  federal  income  tax  consequences  of the
different types of Qualified  Plans which may be funded by the Contract  offered
by this  Prospectus  is only a brief  summary and is not intended as tax advice.
The rules governing the provisions of Qualified Plans are extremely  complex and
often  difficult to  comprehend.  Anything  less than full  compliance  with the
applicable  rules,  all of which are  subject to change,  may have  adverse  tax
consequences.  A prospective  Contract Owner considering adoption of a Qualified
Plan and purchase of a Contract in connection  therewith  should first consult a
qualified  and  competent  tax  advisor  with regard to the  suitability  of the
Contract as an investment vehicle for the Qualified Plan.                       

     Periodic  distributions (e.g.,  annuities and installment  payments) from a
Qualified  Plan that will last for a period of ten or more  years are  generally
subject  to  voluntary  income tax  withholding.  The  amount  withheld  on such
periodic  distributions  is  determined  at the rate  applicable  to wages.  The
recipient of a periodic distribution may generally elect not to have withholding
apply.                                                                          

     Nonperiodic  distributions  (e.g.,  lump-sums and annuities or  installment
payments  of less than 10 years)  from a  Qualified  Plan  (other than IRAs) are
generally  subject  to  mandatory  20%  income  tax  withholding.   However,  no
withholding is imposed if the  distribution  is transferred  directly to another
eligible  Qualified  Plan  or  IRA.  Nonperiodic  distributions  from an IRA are
subject to income tax  withholding  at a flat 10% rate.  The recipient of such a
distribution may elect not to have withholding apply.                           

403(b) PROGRAMS - CONSTRAINTS ON WITHDRAWALS 

     Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code permits public school employees
and employees of  organizations  specified in Section  501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code, such as certain types of charitable,  educational,  and scientific
organizations,   to  purchase   annuity   contracts,   and  subject  to  certain
limitations,  to exclude the amount of purchase  payments  from gross income for
federal  tax  purposes.   Section   403(b)  imposes   restrictions   on  certain
distributions from  tax-sheltered  annuity contracts meeting the requirements of
Section 403(b) that apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 1989.   

     Section   403(b)   requires   that   distributions   from  Section   403(b)
tax-sheltered  annuities that are  attributable to employee  contributions  made
after December 31, 1988 under a salary reduction  agreement not begin before the
employee reaches age 59 1/2, separates from service,  dies, becomes disabled, or
incurs a hardship. Furthermore, distributions of income or gains attributable to
such contributions accrued after December 31, 1988 may not be made on account of
hardship.  Hardship,  for this purpose, is generally defined as an immediate and
heavy  financial need,  such as paying for medical  expenses,  the purchase of a
principal residence, or paying certain tuition expenses.                        

     An Owner of a Contract  purchased as a tax-deferred  Section 403(b) annuity
contract will not, therefore,  be entitled to exercise the right of surrender or
withdrawal,  as  described  in this  Prospectus,  in order to receive his or her
Contract Value attributable to Premiums paid under a salary reduction  agreement
or any income or gains credited to such Contract                                

28

P-->49732nd�Page�of�35TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
Owner under the Contract unless one of the  above-described  conditions has been
satisfied,  or unless the  withdrawal is otherwise  permitted  under  applicable
federal tax law. In the case of transfers of amounts  accumulated in a different
Section 403(b)  contract to this Contract under a Section  403(b)  Program,  the
withdrawal constraints described above would not apply to the amount transferred
to the Contract  attributable  to a Contract  Owner's  December 31, 1988 account
balance under the old contract,  provided that the amounts  transferred  between
contracts  meets  certain  conditions.  An  Owner's  Contract  may be able to be
transferred  to certain  other  investment or funding  alternatives  meeting the
requirements  of Section 403(b) that are available  under an employer's  Section
403(b) arrangement.                                                             

 OTHER INFORMATION

VOTING OF SHARES OF THE FUNDS 

     AUL is the legal owner of the shares of the Portfolios of the Funds held by
the Investment  Accounts of the Variable Account. In accordance with its view of
present  applicable  law, AUL will exercise  voting rights  attributable  to the
shares of the Funds  held in the  Investment  Accounts  at regular  and  special
meetings  of the  shareholders  of the Funds on  matters  requiring  shareholder
voting  under the 1940 Act.  AUL will  exercise  these  voting  rights  based on
instructions  received from persons having the voting interest in  corresponding
Investment Accounts of the Variable Account and consistent with any requirements
imposed on AUL under contracts with any of the Funds,  or under  applicable law.
However, if the 1940 Act or any regulations  thereunder should be amended, or if
the present interpretation thereof should change, and as a result AUL determines
that it is  permitted  to vote the shares of the Funds in its own right,  it may
elect to do so.                                                                 

     The person  having the voting  interest  under a Contract  is the  Contract
Owner.  AUL or the  pertinent  Fund shall send to each  Contract  Owner a Fund's
proxy materials and forms of instruction by means of which  instructions  may be
given to AUL on how to exercise voting rights attributable to the Fund's shares.

     Unless otherwise required by applicable law or under a contract with any of
the Funds,  with  respect to each of the Funds,  the number of Fund shares as to
which  voting  instructions  may be given to AUL is  determined  by dividing the
value of all of the Accumulation  Units of the corresponding  Investment Account
attributable to a Contract on a particular date by the net asset value per share
of that Fund as of the same date.  Fractional votes will be counted.  The number
of votes as to which voting  instructions  may be given will be determined as of
the  date  coinciding  with  the  date  established  by a Fund  for  determining
shareholders eligible to vote at the meeting of the Fund. If required by the SEC
or under a contract  with any of the Funds,  AUL reserves the right to determine
in a different fashion the voting rights attributable to the shares of the Fund.
Voting instructions may be cast in person or by proxy.                          

     Voting  rights  attributable  to the  Contracts  for which no timely voting
instructions  are received  will be voted by AUL in the same  proportion  as the
voting  instructions  which are  received in a timely  manner for all  Contracts
participating in that Investment Account. AUL will vote shares of any Investment
Account, if any, that it owns beneficially in its own discretion, except that if
a Fund offers it shares to any  insurance  company  separate  account that funds
variable life insurance  contracts or if otherwise required by applicable law or
contract,  AUL will vote its own  shares in the same  proportion  as the  voting
instructions that are received in a timely manner for Contracts participating in
the Investment Account.                                                         
     Neither the Variable Account nor AUL is under any duty to inquire as to the
instructions  received  or the  authority  of Owners or others to  instruct  the
voting of shares of any of the Funds.                                           

SUBSTITUTION OF INVESTMENTS 

     AUL  reserves  the  right,  subject to  compliance  with the law as then in
effect, to make additions to, deletions from, substitutions for, or combinations
of the  securities  that  are held by the  Variable  Account  or any  Investment
Account or that the Variable Account or any Investment Account may purchase.  If
shares of any or all of the Funds should become  unavailable for investment,  or
if, in the judgment of AUL's management,  further investment in shares of any or
all of the Funds  should  become  inappropriate  in view of the  purposes of the
Contracts,  AUL may  substitute  shares  of  another  fund  for  shares  already
purchased,  or to be purchased in the future under the  Contracts.  AUL may also
purchase,  through the Variable  Account,  other securities for other classes of
contracts,  or permit a conversion  between classes of contracts on the basis of
requests made by Contract Owners or as permitted by Federal law.                

     Where  required  under  applicable  law, AUL will not substitute any shares
attributable  to a Contract  Owner's  interest in an  Investment  Account or the

INDIVIDUAL FLEXIBLE PREMIUM DEFERRED VARIABLE ANNUITY                           

Supplement Dated February 20, 2001                                              
To The Prospectus Dated May 1, 2000                                             

Page 8 of the  Prospectus  of  Individual  Flexible  Premium  Deferred  Variable
Annuity  is  revised  to  add  the  following   language  after  the  "Portfolio
Rebalancing Program" paragraph:                                                 

"Bonus Programs                                                                 

     "AUL may  offer,  under  certain  circumstances,  potential  customers  the
opportunity  to exchange  their non-AUL  contracts for contracts  offered herein
with an additional bonus-up of qualifying first year premium ("Exchange Offer").
AUL,  from  its  general   account,   will  provide  a  4%  bonus  to  each  new
contractholder  who  accepts  the  offer,  which is  based  on the  value of the
contract surrendered (the "Exchanged Contract") in exchange for the AUL contract
(the "New  Contract").  The Bonus will be applied to the New Contract  after the
expiration of the Right to Examine Period.  (For purposes of determining the end
of the Right to Examine  Period,  solely as it relates to the application of the
Bonus, we assume that receipt of this policy occurs five calendar days after the
contract date. See "Right to Examine Period.")                                  

     "This Exchange Offer is not available to current AUL customers  desiring to
exchange  their  current AUL contracts for a new AUL contract with a bonus-up of
Account  Value.  Furthermore,  the  Exchange  Offer may only be  available  with
certain  plans.  For  example,  the  Enhanced  Averaging  Fixed  Account  is not
available to contracts  purchased  through the Exchange  Offer.  The  Guaranteed
Minimum Annuitization Benefit is likewise unavailable.                          

     "Potential   customers  should  be  advised  that  the  Exchange  Offer  is
specifically  designed for those  customers who intend to continue to hold their
contracts as long-term investment  vehicles.  The Exchange Offer is not intended
for all potential  customers and is especially not  appropriate for any customer
who anticipates  surrendering all or a significant part (i.e., more than the 12%
Free  Withdrawal  Amount on an annual  basis) of his or her contract  before the
expiration of the ten year withdrawal  period. The Exchange Offer will result in
the  imposition of a new Withdrawal  Charge period  regardless of the customer's
current withdrawal charge period of the Exchanged Contract.                     

     "AUL  reserves  the right to withdraw or modify the  Exchange  Offer at any
time."                                                                          

Page 14 of the  prospectus is revised to contain the  following  language at the
end of the first paragraph:                                                     

     "The  following  tables  should be read in  conjunction  with the  Variable
Account's  financial  statements,  which are included in the Variable  Account's
Semi-Annual Report dated as of June 30, 2000."                                  

Page 18,  paragraphs two and three under "American United Insurance  Company(R)"
should be replaced with the following language:                                 

     "On December 17, 2000, AUL converted  from a mutual life insurance  company
to a stock life  insurance  company  ultimately  controlled by a mutual  holding
company ("Mutual Holding Company").  This transaction is intended to result in a
corporate structure that provides, among other things, better access to external
sources of capital.  Upon the  conversion,  the insurance  company issued voting
stock to a newly-formed stock holding company ("Stock Holding  Company").  It is
anticipated that the Stock Holding Company could,  subsequent to the conversion,
offer shares of its stock  publicly or privately;  however,  the Mutual  Holding
Company must always hold at least 51% of the voting  stock of the Stock  Holding
Company,  which in turn would own 100% of the voting stock of AUL. No plans have
been  formulated to issue any shares of capital stock or debt  securities of the
Stock Holding Company at this time.                                             

     "Since  AUL  was  previously  a  mutual  life  insurance  company,   owners
("policyholders")  of  AUL's  annuity  contracts  and  life  insurance  policies
("policies") had certain membership  interests in AUL consisting  principally of
the right to vote on the election of the Board of Directors and on other matters
and certain rights upon  liquidation or dissolution of AUL. Upon the conversion,
policyholders  continue to be policyholders in the same insurance  company,  but
they no longer have a  membership  interest in the  insurance  company;  rather,
policyholders  have membership  interests in the Mutual Holding  Company.  These
interests  in the  Mutual  Holding  Company  are  substantially  the same as the
membership  interests  that  policyholders  had in AUL prior to the  conversion,
consisting  principally  of the  right to vote on the  election  of the Board of
Directors  and  on  other  matters  and  certain  rights  upon   liquidation  or
dissolution of the Mutual Holding  Company.  After the  conversion,  persons who
acquire  policies from AUL would  automatically be members in the Mutual Holding
Company.  The  conversion  will not, in any way,  increase  premium  payments or
reduce  policy  benefits,  values,  guarantees  or other policy  obligations  to
policyholders.  The  conversion has been approved by AUL  policyholders  and the
Insurance Commissioner of Indiana.  Under the conversion,  the insurance company
name did not change.  The Mutual Holding  Company name is American United Mutual
Insurance  Holding  Company.  The  Stock  Holding  Company  Name  is  OneAmerica
Financial Partners, Inc."                                                       

Page 24, add the following  language after the "Portfolio  Rebalancing  Program"
paragraph:                                                                      

"BONUS PROGRAMS                                                                 

     "AUL may  offer,  under  certain  circumstances,  potential  customers  the
opportunity  to exchange  their non-AUL  contracts for contracts  offered herein
with an additional bonus-up of qualifying first year premium ("Exchange Offer").
AUL,  from  its  general   account,   will  provide  a  4%  bonus  to  each  new
contractholder  who  accepts  the  offer,  which is  based  on the  value of the
contract surrendered (the "Exchanged Contract") in exchange for the AUL contract
(the "New  Contract").  The Bonus will be applied to the New Contract  after the
expiration of the Right to Examine Period.  (For purposes of determining the end
of the Right to Examine  Period,  solely as it relates to the application of the
Bonus, we assume that receipt of this policy occurs five calendar days after the
contract date. See "Right to Examine Period.")                                  

     "After   expiration  of  the  New  Contract's   Right  to  Examine  Period,
withdrawals  will be governed by the terms of the New  Contract  for purposes of
calculating any contingent  deferred sales charges  ("Withdrawal  Charges";  see
"Withdrawal  Charge").  The  Exchange  Offer will be  communicated  to potential
clients  by  providing  them with a  prospectus  for the New  Contracts  and the
SelectPoint Bonus Program disclosure form.                                      

     "This Exchange Offer is not available to current AUL customers  desiring to
exchange  their  current AUL contracts for a new AUL contract with a bonus-up of
Account  Value.  Furthermore,  the  Exchange  Offer may only be  available  with
certain  plans.  For  example,  the  Enhanced  Averaging  Fixed  Account  is not
available to contracts  purchased  through the Exchange  Offer.  The  Guaranteed
Minimum Annuitization Benefit is likewise unavailable.                          

     "The  Exchange  Offer may be  available  to  customers,  both  current  and
potential,  paying  cash  rather  than  exchanging  account  value  into the New
Contract.                                                                       

     "Potential   customers  should  be  advised  that  the  Exchange  Offer  is
specifically  designed for those  customers who intend to continue to hold their
contracts as long-term investment  vehicles.  The Exchange Offer is not intended
for all potential  customers and is especially not  appropriate for any customer
who anticipates  surrendering all or a significant part (i.e., more than the 12%
Free  Withdrawal  Amount on an annual  basis) of his or her contract  before the
expiration of the ten year withdrawal  period. The Exchange Offer will result in
the  imposition of a new Withdrawal  Charge period  regardless of the customer's
current withdrawal charge period of the Exchanged Contract.                     

     "If a contract is surrendered  during the new Withdrawal Charge period, the
4% bonus  may be more than  offset by the  Withdrawal  Charge;  and a  potential
customer may be worse off than if he had not made the  exchange.  The  potential
customer  should also compare the Mortality and Expense Risk charges,  and other
charges,  of the Exchanged  Contract and the New Contract to be certain that the
New Contract does not deduct higher charges,  thus offsetting the benefit of the
bonus paid.                                                                     

     "The  Exchange  Program  bonus  will only  apply to  qualifying  first year
premium.  Initial  deposits  of $10,000 or more will  qualify  for a bonus.  Any
initial deposit of less than $10,000 will not be eligible for a bonus;  however,
initial  deposits  of less  than  $10,000  will be  aggregated  with  subsequent
deposits of premium in the first  Contract  Year and AUL will pay a bonus on the
aggregated  amount  at  the  end  of  the  first  Contract  Year  provided  such
aggregation totals $10,000 by the end of the first Contract Year.               

     "To  accept  the  Exchange  Offer,  the  potential  client  must  sign  the
"SelectPoint  Plus Bonus Program"  disclosure  form in addition to any customary
applications and paperwork.                                                     

     "AUL  reserves  the right to withdraw or modify the  Exchange  Offer at any
time."

    Enterprise FAQs
  



	Mutual Organization: More Than a Structure

	At OneAmerica, "mutual" is more than a structure. It’s a philosophy and a business model that supports our promise to be there when our customers need us most.

	In 2000, the companies of OneAmerica reorganized to a mutual holding company structure. As a mutual organization, our first priority is the customer, not Wall Street. Policyholders elect our board of directors; we have no external shareholders. Because we don’t have the short-term distractions of quarterly earnings calls, stock prices and the other pressures felt by public companies, our mutual structure lets us focus on providing long-term value for our customers by creating and protecting their assets.

	The mutual structure supports growth by giving us the flexibility to bring other mutual insurance companies into the organization. And it lets us be more efficient in our capital structure, to support growth and financial strength over the long term.

	Is OneAmerica part of a mutual insurance organization?

	Yes, OneAmerica and its operating companies (including American United Life Insurance Company®, The State Life Insurance Company and Pioneer Mutual Life Insurance Company) are part of a mutual holding company group. All companies are ultimately owned by American United Mutual Insurance Holding Company (AUMIHC).

	When I look up OneAmerica, AUL, State Life and Pioneer, it says they are stock companies. How can you be a mutual organization when you have stock companies?

	These stock companies are ultimately owned by the mutual holding company parent, American United Mutual Insurance Holding Company (AUMIHC). There are no external shareholders. AUMIHC owns all of the stock of OneAmerica, and OneAmerica owns all of the stock of AUL, State Life and Pioneer.

	When a customer purchases a policy at AUL, State Life or Pioneer, they become a member of the holding company (AUMIHC) and gain certain rights, including the right to vote for the AUMIHC board of directors. Being a family of companies ultimately controlled by its policyholders makes OneAmerica® a mutual organization.

	Who controls OneAmerica and its operating companies?

	Policyholders. Eligible policyholders of our insurance subsidiaries elect the board of directors of the holding company that ultimately provides the direction and guidance to the enterprise.

	Are there outside shareholders who influence or control OneAmerica and its companies?

	No. There are no external shareholders.

	Does OneAmerica plan to issue stock to external shareholders or "go public?"

	We plan to remain a mutual organization and to continue to manage the company for the benefit of our policyholders rather than for the benefit of external shareholders.

	Why did the company convert to a mutual holding company structure?

	The mutual holding company structure lets us add other like-minded mutual companies to the structure. Policyholders benefit from the increased scale, financial strength and resources of the combined organization. And the holding company structure lets us manage capital more efficiently and effectively.

	Why is mutuality so important?

	As a financial services organization, we make long-term promises. Benefits often don’t come due for 20 or 30 years, and a lot can happen in that time frame. So a long-term view is vital. We believe mutuality is a superior form of ownership because it supports long-term thinking. And our performance during the recent downturn is a testament to our financial strength and conservative risk management over the long term.

	Is OneAmerica a mutual or stock company?

	We are organized as a mutual holding company. Our operating subsidiaries are stock companies ultimately owned by a mutual holding company parent. Policyholders, not public shareholders, guide all aspects of our operation through the board of directors they elect.

** Disclaimer: Investors should consider
				carefully the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of
				the fund before investing. The prospectus contains this and other
				information about the fund. The AUL American Unit Trust prospectus
				and the underlying fund prospectuses may be accessed at www.eretirement.aul.com
				or by calling American United Life Insurance Company at
				1-800-403-4173.
 1 The total return
				figures shown are net of the ordinary operating expenses for each
				fund, but do not reflect a deduction for any contract related
				charges and fees such as mortality & expense risk charges,
				administrative expenses, premium tax charges, maintenance fees or
				other expenses that might be incurred under a group variable annuity
				contract. If included in these total return figures, any such
				charges would lower the performance shown. For a complete
				description of the charges, expenses or fees that apply to your
				contract, please contact your Employer or Plan Administrator. For a
				more complete description of the performance calculation and other
				important information, see "Things You Should Know About Your
				Investments" at www.eretirement.aul.com or write to AUL at P.O.
				Box 6148, Indianapolis, Indiana 46206-6148.
The above returns are historical and past
				performance does not guarantee future results. Current performance
				may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. The investment
				return and principal value of the Investment Accounts will
				fluctuate, so that a participant's units when redeemed may be
				worth more or less than their original cost.
				Any performance reported before AUL first offered
				an investment option is hypothetical and was calculated by adjusting
				the underlying fund's performance by current applicable contract
				charges.
				Unit values given in this statement are based on
				net asset values provided by the funds and are not independently
				verified by AUL. If AUL receives inaccurate information, the unit
				value may be affected accordingly. If an error is subsequently
				discovered by any fund and reported to AUL, a participant's
				account will be recalculated to reflect the correct fund value,
				provided that the error was material under federal securities laws.




















				
				Diversification cannot eliminate the risk of
				investment losses.
 2 Lesser of 10
				years or since inception.
 3 An investment in
				high yield securities may be subject to more credit risks than
				higher quality securities.
 4 Sector funds may
				experience greater short-term price volatility than more diversified
				equity funds, and are most suitable for the aggressive portion of an
				investment portfolio.
 5 There are
				additional risks associated with international investing, such as
				currency fluctuations, economic and political factors, etc. not
				associated with investing exclusively in the U.S.
 6 The inception
				date of each T. Rowe Price R share class fund is September 30, 2002.
				Performance reported prior to this date was calculated by adjusting
				the underlying fund's performance for any asset-based charge
				specific to the R share class.
 7 Micro-, Small-
				and Mid-Cap company stocks are more volatile than large company
				stocks.
 8 Investors cannot
				invest directly in any index.
 9 Allianz/PIMCO
				funds are distributed by Allianz Global Investors Distributors LLC.
				The PIMCO Funds: Multi-Manager Series (MMS) stock funds have been
				renamed the Allianz Funds. The PIMCO Funds: Pacific Investment
				Management Series (PIMS) bond funds will remain the PIMCO Funds.
 10 The inception
				date of each Allianz/PIMCO R Share Class fund is December 31, 2002.
				The performance numbers show performance of a fund's
				Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the distribution
				and/or service (12b-1) fees, administrative fees and
				other expenses paid by Class R shares. Although Institutional Class
				and Class R shares would have similar annual returns (because all of
				a fund's shares represent interests in the same portfolio of
				securities). Class R performance would be lower than Institutional
				Class performance because of the lower expenses paid by
				Institutional Class shares.
 11 The Franklin
				Flex Cap Growth Fund invests primariliy in California companies'
				equity securities, and events and conditions in California are
				likely to affect the fund's investments and its performance.
				These events may include changes in the economic and political
				conditions within that state, which are unpredictable and can change
				at any time. It also invests in technology stocks, which can be
				highly volatile.
