Carl B. McGowan Jr.https://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/Recent works by Carl B. McGowan Jr.en-usCopyright (c) 2017 All rights reserved.Wed, 26 Jul 2017 17:21:05 -00003600The impact of family complexity on the attitudes toward an international career of Russian nationalshttps://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/11/<p>This paper examines attitudes of Russian MBA students toward international careers and finds that family complexity impacts responses. Respondents who have complex family situations were slightly favorable toward international careers with average survey response values of about 2.50. The average response values for survey respondents who were not in complex family situations were neutral (3.00) toward an international career. The results of this survey indicate that Russian MBA students are, on average, only slightly favorable toward international careers. The average response values were not different based on gender since the average response value for males was 2.65 and the average response value for females was 2.71. These results contrast with an earlier study that found a stronger preference for international careers among Russian MBA students. Current MBA students in Moscow have more career opportunities than before. The results are based on the responses of twenty-seven Russian students in an AACSB accredited MBA program in Moscow who speak both Russian and English and work for an international company or agency.</p>
H. W.

In the case of Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia has successfully implemented a merger program for Malaysian banks in order to face the onslaught of the imminent financial deregulation brought about by globalization. The purpose of this paper is to provide additional insights into the improvement of a bank’s financial situation, i.e. commercial banks, because of the recent series of bank mergers in Malaysia. This paper also presents an application of a model for financial analysis of a bank based on the DuPont system presented in Saunders (2000). Bank return on equity is decomposed into net profit margin, total asset turnover and the equity multiplier. This model is applied to the Hong Leong Bank Berhad. Hong Leong Bank is one of the ten anchor banks in Malaysia that must satisfy the requirement of having a minimum RM2 billion shareholders’ fund and a minimum total assets of RM25 billion.</p>
https://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/2/No Subject AreaGender and attitude toward an international career: a survey of Russian nationalshttps://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/9/<p>This paper examines attitudes of Russian MBA students toward international careers and finds that gender is not an issue but that respondents with family constraints were less favorable toward an international career. Respondents who are male, single, or with no children were slightly favorable toward international careers. Women and respondents with spouses without a career were neutral toward international careers. Respondents who were married, respondents with children, and respondents with a spouse with a career, were slightly unfavorable toward an international career. The results of this survey indicate that Russian MBA students are, on average, only slightly favorable toward international careers. These results contrast with an earlier study that found a stronger preference for international careers among Russian MBA students. Current MBA students in Moscow have more career opportunities than before. The results are based on the responses of twenty-nine Russian students in an AACSB accredited MBA program in Moscow who speak both Russian and English and work for an international company or agency.</p>
https://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/9/No Subject AreaPlagiarism: let the policy fix the crimehttps://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/1/<p>Plagiarism is considered to be an unacceptable act, a crime, in today’s University. This is reinforced by the Latin and Greek origins of the word, i.e., meaning to ‘plunder’ or ‘kidnap’. An Australian Vice-Chancellor was recently asked to resign following public allegations and findings of his plagiarism. Universities adopt and publicise policies to illustrate what they expect from their students. We posit that while some students plagiarise for reasons endogenous to those students, others do so as a result of poorly designed and constructed assignments and assessment tasks. From a simple example involving the use of the plagiarism detection software program, “Turnitin” and 50, 2nd year Accounting students’ essays, we find the demonstrated level of ‘originality’ and ‘research’ as acceptable for the task the students had been set. However, we conclude that those responsible for formulating and setting assessment tasks require greater consideration of issues of cognitive development and complexity.</p>
https://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/1/No Subject AreaEvaluating the impact of a rapidly changing economic environment of bank financial performance using the DuPont system of financial analysishttps://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/4/<p>This paper presents a model for the financial analysis of a bank in a rapidly changing environment based on the DuPont system of financial analysis. The DuPont system of financial analysis is based on analysis of return on equity which is disaggregated into net profit margin, total asset turnover and the equity multiplier. AFFIN Bank Malaysia is one of the largest banks in Malaysia and is one of the core banks from the consolidation process of the banking industry in response to the Southeast Asian economic crisis in 1997-98. The analysis covers begins in 1999 which is the year that AFFIN Bank was formed until 2006. The DuPont system of financial analysis shows the impact of the Asian financial crisis and the restructuring of the banking industry in Malaysia on the financial performance of AFFIN Bank and the gradual recovery of AFFIN Bank to return to steady performance over the past eight years.</p>
https://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/4/No Subject AreaUsing accounting information for financial institution analysis in an evolving environmenthttps://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/6/<p>Return on equity analysis provides a system for planning as well as analyzing financial institution performance. In the case of Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia has successfully implemented a merger program for Malaysian banks in order to compete in the face of financial deregulation brought about by globalization. The purpose of this paper is to provide additional insights into the improvement of a bank’s financial situation, i.e. commercial banks, due to the recent series of bank mergers in Malaysia. This paper presents an application of the model for the financial analysis of a bank based on the DuPont system of financial analysis presented in Saunders (2000). Bank return on equity is decomposed into net profit margin, total asset turnover and the equity multiplier. This model is applied to Maybank in Malaysia which is one of the ten anchor banks in Malaysia that must satisfy the requirement of having a minimum RM2 billion shareholders fund and a minimum total assets of RM25 billion. Over the period of study from 1998 to 2003, during which substantial financial difficulties existed, Maybank’s assets rose gradually. Both income and expenses dropped during the study period with unusually large decreases in expenses in 2000 because decreases in both interest expense and loan loss and provision. This combination leads to an increase in net profit margin and a subsequent increase in return on equity leading to an increase in the stock price. Maybank appears to have benefited from the financial crisis in Malaysia and the subsequent restructuring of the banking industry.</p>
https://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/6/No Subject AreaAn example of the use of financial ratio analysis: the case of Motorolahttps://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/7/<p>In this paper, we demonstrate the use of actual financial data for financial ratio analysis. We construct a financial and industry analysis for Motorola Corporation. The objective is to show students exactly how to compute ratios for an actual company. This paper demonstrates the difficulties in applying the principles of financial ratio analysis when the data are not homogeneous as is the case in textbook examples. We use Motorola as an example because the firm has several segments, two of which account for the majority of sales and represent two industries (semi-conductor and communications) that have different characteristics. The case illustrates the complexity of financial analysis.</p>
https://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/7/No Subject AreaComputing the divisional cost of capital using the pure play methodhttps://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/8/The Cost of Capital Model is used to calculate the net present value of projects within a multi-unit corporation but may provide incorrect answers for projects that have a level of risk that differs from the overall average risk level for the corporation.  We demonstrate the use of the Pure Play Method for calculating the required rate of return for a division of a corporation that has risk characteristics that differ from the risk characteristics of the overall corporation.  We apply this methodology to the Integrated Electronic Systems Segment of the Motorola Corporation.  We find that the IESS division cost of capital of is 9.3% rather than the 12.3% cost of capital for the corporation as a whole.https://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/8/No Subject AreaFinancial analysis of financial institutions in an evolving environmenthttps://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/10/<p>This paper presents a model for the financial analysis of a bank based on the DuPont system of financial analysis. The bank return on equity is decomposed into net profit margin, total asset turnover and the equity multiplier. This model is applied to AFFIN Bank Malaysia of which is one of the largest banks in Malaysia for the period from 1999 to 2005. The DuPont system of financial analysis shows the impact of the Asian financial crisis on the financial performance of AFFIN Bank that affected the region in 1997-98. The impact of the financial crisis on AFFIN Bank share prices is clearly visible.</p>
https://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/10/No Subject AreaThe last discrimination: Gay men and lesbians in the classroomhttps://works.bepress.com/carl_b_mcgowan_jr/3/A democracy can only be strong when the rights of all the people are protected. If given the opportunity; individuals or groups that promote intolerance, hate, and bigotry will in time deny rights to all. Discrimination is at least as old as recorded history. The Roman Empire and Classical Greek society created a class system. Some were citizens; males only of course as women were treated more like property; others were slaves and traded and owned by others. Some were free men. However, during the early centuries of the Roman Empire and during virtually all of the Classical Greek period, same sex male / male relationships and conduct appear to have been the norm and these relationships accepted and acknowledged (perhaps even ignored) by the population and the governments. The Egyptians also believed in a class like social structure. India had a caste system that justified discrimination between groups of people. Only recently has this categorization been addressed, but traces of the old social and cultural biases remain in segments of the populations.H. W.
