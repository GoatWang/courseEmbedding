Larry Mizel: An empire built on real estate and faith He turned $18,000 into millions By Lisa Ryckman






Published: 2016.02.19 03:11 AM




THEN
Larry Mizel’s real estate empire started in 1966 with an $18,000 investment in 10 percent of just over an acre of land near Mexico and Colorado Boulevard.
“I went all in,” he says. “When my grandfather passed away, he left me $24,000. My father, under very careful money management, took that to $20,000. So I had $18,000 for one deal and $2,000 to live on, which in those days, was more than enough. During that period of time, I learned how to be a builder.”
From there, Mizel’s business grew. He graduated from the University of Denver Law School in 1967, and five years later, he founded the Mizel Development Corp., now known as M.D.C. Holdings Inc. Along the way, he says he learned the hard lessons of the real estate business.
“There’s no such thing as an easy deal,” Mizel says. “Over the years, having developed different types of properties, when the market is right, construction’s a problem, when construction’s not a problem, the market’s going in different directions.
“Real estate is always bad except for short periods of time when it’s good,” he says. “It’s really hard, it’s not quick, it’s not easy. And you shouldn’t do it unless you’re planning on making a long career out of it.”
In 1986, Mizel founded and served as the inaugural chairman of Colorado Concern, an organization committed to promoting sustainable business growth and advancing the economic well-being of Colorado.
During the 1990s, Mizel founded and served as board chair of real estate investment trusts Asset Investors Corp. and Commercial Assets Inc. He also was board chair of Omnibank, a multibank holding company, until its sale to KeyCorp in 1995. In 1996, Mizel was named Honorary Dean of the University of Denver’s Burns School of Real Estate and Construction Management.
 “Looking at Larry, I think, here’s a guy who’s going to get it done­ – no matter what happens,” says Dick Robinson, Mizel’s friend of 30 years. “He’s amazing in the way he focuses on the deal. He’s not afraid to take risks, but it’s calculated.”
Mizel has also dedicated his energy and money to honoring and preserving Jewish culture and history in Denver and elsewhere. Mizel is a founder of Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, which promotes tolerance around the world. He and his wife, Carol, founded the Mizel Museum in 1982, dedicated to celebrating Jewish culture.
“The museum is really designed to be an outreach to the broader community, and our focal point has been bridges of understanding, which is bringing people together of different races and different religions, to show mostly younger people in school what they have similar with each other,” Mizel says.
The Mizels also started The Mizel Arts and Culture Center at the Jewish Community Center in Denver, which features performing arts and other creative and cultural programs.
“When I came to Denver, I had a few friends from college, no relatives, no money and lots of time on my hands,” Mizel says. “I was fortunate enough that I found Denver was open to someone who was willing to work hard and give back."
NOW
Mizel serves as chairman and CEO of M.D.C. Holdings Inc., parent corporation of Richmond American Homes, which also includes HomeAmerican Mortgage Corp., American Home Insurance Agency Inc. and American Home Title and Escrow Co. Richmond American has built more than 180,000 homes, mostly in the Western U.S.
Colorado Concern, started by Mizel and 11 other businesspeople, is still going strong, with more than 110 private sector CEOs and civic leaders from across the state committing business leadership and financial resources to support business-friendly legislative candidates and statewide policies.
The Mizel Museum has expanded to include the Mizel Institute and The Counterterrorism Education Learning Lab (The CELL), a nonprofit dedicated to educating the public about the threat of global terrorism.
“In Colorado, there are very few organizations that we haven’t tried to be helpful to,” Mizel says. “Obviously, you can’t do everything, but you try to do a little in as many places as we can. We’ve tried to leverage what we do with others. And it’s been important.”

The Mizell Brothers were a record producing team in the 1970s, consisting of Larry Mizell (February 17, 1944, New York City, New York) and Alphonso "Fonce" Mizell (January 15, 1943, New York City, New York - July 5, 2011, Los Angeles, California).[1][2]

History[edit]
Larry earned a degree in engineering and Fonce Mizell earned a degree in music from Howard University. While there they formed and performed in a jazz vocal quartet, the Vanlords. In the early 1970s, Larry and Fonce Mizell moved to California to start their own company, Sky High Productions. They went on to produce albums for Blue Note Records that set the tone for jazz fusion and the era. The Mizell Brothers often used the same musicians on their albums, including Harvey Mason on drums, Mayuto Correa on percussion, Melvin "Wah Wah Watson" Ragin and David T. Walker on guitar, Chuck Rainey on bass and Jerry Peters on piano. Freddie Perren and Chuck Davis were sometimes involved as co-writers or co-producers.
Later hits of Sky High Productions include A Taste of Honey's platinum-selling roller-rink anthem of 1978 "Boogie Oogie Oogie", L.T.D.'s "Love Ballad", a number 1 R&B hit (#20 pop) in 1976 and Mary Wells' dance funk 12-inch "Gigolo" in 1982. Younger brother Rodney Mizell co-wrote some of their songs, although most material initially was written by Larry Mizell, later joined by Fonce. They also included a number of Motown hits on Donald Byrd's albums including Just My Imagination and Dancing in the Street. In the 1980s, the Mizell brothers retired from the record industry, but returned in the 2000s. Larry Mizell wrote and performed vocals on the song "Play with the Changes" on the 4Hero album of the same name in 2007.[3]
Larry[edit]
As an electrical engineer, Larry Mizell performed testing and reliability work on the Lunar Module for the NASA Apollo program. He was one of the first to do research on liquid crystals, which today are used for example in displays (LCD).
Alphonso[edit]
Alphonso Mizell was a member of The Corporation, the Motown hit-making production team that wrote and produced all of The Jackson 5's essential early hits from 1969 through 1971, including "I Want You Back," "ABC," "The Love You Save," "Mama's Pearl," and "Maybe Tomorrow." The Corporation also consisted of Motown founder Berry Gordy plus writer-producers Deke Richards, who brought Fonce to the company, and Freddie Perren, a classmate of the Mizells at Howard who also later worked for Sky High Productions.
When Motown moved to Los Angeles, the Mizells joined up with trumpet player Donald Byrd under whom they had studied while at Howard University. Their first album, Black Byrd on the Blue Note label, was the first of a string of albums together that would define jazz-funk and lay the foundation for acid jazz and neo soul. Alphonso died of heart failure on July 5, 2011 at age 68.[2]

Mizell Brothers

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Larry Mizell)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

The Mizell Brothers were a record producing team in the 1970s, consisting of Larry Mizell (February 17, 1944, New York City, New York) and Alphonso "Fonce" Mizell (January 15, 1943, New York City, New York - July 5, 2011, Los Angeles, California).[1][2]

History[edit]
Larry earned a degree in engineering and Fonce Mizell earned a degree in music from Howard University. While there they formed and performed in a jazz vocal quartet, the Vanlords. In the early 1970s, Larry and Fonce Mizell moved to California to start their own company, Sky High Productions. They went on to produce albums for Blue Note Records that set the tone for jazz fusion and the era. The Mizell Brothers often used the same musicians on their albums, including Harvey Mason on drums, Mayuto Correa on percussion, Melvin "Wah Wah Watson" Ragin and David T. Walker on guitar, Chuck Rainey on bass and Jerry Peters on piano. Freddie Perren and Chuck Davis were sometimes involved as co-writers or co-producers.
Later hits of Sky High Productions include A Taste of Honey's platinum-selling roller-rink anthem of 1978 "Boogie Oogie Oogie", L.T.D.'s "Love Ballad", a number 1 R&B hit (#20 pop) in 1976 and Mary Wells' dance funk 12-inch "Gigolo" in 1982. Younger brother Rodney Mizell co-wrote some of their songs, although most material initially was written by Larry Mizell, later joined by Fonce. They also included a number of Motown hits on Donald Byrd's albums including Just My Imagination and Dancing in the Street. In the 1980s, the Mizell brothers retired from the record industry, but returned in the 2000s. Larry Mizell wrote and performed vocals on the song "Play with the Changes" on the 4Hero album of the same name in 2007.[3]
Larry[edit]
As an electrical engineer, Larry Mizell performed testing and reliability work on the Lunar Module for the NASA Apollo program. He was one of the first to do research on liquid crystals, which today are used for example in displays (LCD).
Alphonso[edit]
Alphonso Mizell was a member of The Corporation, the Motown hit-making production team that wrote and produced all of The Jackson 5's essential early hits from 1969 through 1971, including "I Want You Back," "ABC," "The Love You Save," "Mama's Pearl," and "Maybe Tomorrow." The Corporation also consisted of Motown founder Berry Gordy plus writer-producers Deke Richards, who brought Fonce to the company, and Freddie Perren, a classmate of the Mizells at Howard who also later worked for Sky High Productions.
When Motown moved to Los Angeles, the Mizells joined up with trumpet player Donald Byrd under whom they had studied while at Howard University. Their first album, Black Byrd on the Blue Note label, was the first of a string of albums together that would define jazz-funk and lay the foundation for acid jazz and neo soul. Alphonso died of heart failure on July 5, 2011 at age 68.[2]
