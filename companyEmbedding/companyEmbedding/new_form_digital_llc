Online enrollment, sign up with digital forms and e-signatures | Adobe
















































Deliver the same great experience on every channel. Read The Digital Enrollment Imperative ›








 
 
Sign-ups made simple.
 
 








You want an enrollment experience that’s secure, compliant, and so painless that customers might actually find it refreshing. You also need to give them the flexibility to start on a mobile device, switch to another device, and then finish up wherever they are next. Today no one wants to deal with complicated paper-based forms. And everyone expects a great experience on every device. Going digital can save you time, money, and allow you to personalize enrollment so it works better.











 
Get your enrollment rolling.

















 




 
Your customers are on the move, so your enrollment experiences need to be too. If you have clunky web or paper-like experiences on mobile devices, your customers may switch to pricy in-person or telephone options — or give up altogether. But when you offer seamless, consistent experiences across all devices, enrollment is a breeze.










 




    



 Adobe can help. With Adobe Experience Manager, you can easily create the same engaging customer experiences for mobile, tablets, and desktops — and deliver them without writing code. Using the same content, Experience Manager creates mobile-optimized sites, pages, forms, and documents that automatically adjust for all devices. Customers can start a transaction on a smartphone, continue on a desktop, and then complete it on a tablet — picking up right where they left off. And if any of them drop off along the way, Adobe Campaign helps you re-engage them with targeted emails.
  



Learn about Experience Manager




Learn about Campaign ›
















 
Make your forms safe and sound.

















 




You’ve heard that electronic signatures can help make enrollment convenient and fast for your customers. Yet some departments still think paper forms and signatures are safer than digital. What they don’t realize is that e-signatures can streamline sign-ups and processing, saving you time and money while being completely secure and compliant.











 




    



 Adobe can help. With Experience Manager Forms and Adobe Sign, you can make your enrollment process paperless, compliant, and secure. You can simplify forms by prefilling data from existing customer or social media profiles. Meet the most stringent security and web accessibility requirements and support the highest level of signer authentication. Say goodbye to printing, scanning, and postage costs. Plus, you’ll find it easier to adapt to changing compliance requirements without reprinting anything.
  



Learn about Adobe Sign




Learn about Experience Manager Forms ›
 






 










 
Move from paper planes to digital jets.

















 




It’s time-consuming and costly to have developers create and update your forms — especially if you have multiple versions that have to work well on the web, in mobile, and in apps. You’d like to take control and have the ability to create and manage digital forms on your own more efficiently, getting you to market faster.











 








 Adobe can help. With Experience Manager Forms, you can quickly create and manage forms that are consistent on every device. The simple drag-and-drop tools make it easy to define and apply styles, colors, and fonts. Localize content and insert logic rules. Even set dynamic behavior — without coding. After forms are submitted, automated workflows connect them to back-end systems and save you processing time.
  



Learn about Experience Manager Forms
















 
Get up close and personal with your customers.

















 




It’s important to know exactly how your customers experience enrollment. Of course, you want to understand how long it takes to complete an application, which groups of customers are interacting at each step, and where they’re dropping off. These are the kinds of insights that will help you personalize the customer experience, increase conversion, and drive sales.











 




    



 Adobe can help. With Adobe Analytics, you can get real-time insights into how customers experience your enrollment. See where they’re engaged and learn where they drop off. Then use Adobe Target to test multiple versions of a form and encourage cross-selling with personalized approval letters, welcome kits, and promotions.

Streamlined enrollment. At your service.

















 




Today’s consumers want a streamlined sign-up process they can start and complete on any device. In many industries, customer interactions involve the exchange of a lot of information, including when customers sign up, onboard, and apply for services. Delivering the most modern enrollment experience requires the right combination of data, insights, and tools.











 




Why Adobe.



 Adobe gives you everything you need to deliver relevant, personalized enrollment experiences. Create them for desktops and mobile devices all in one location — without coding. Build easy-to-complete forms with legally binding electronic signatures thanks to integration with Adobe Sign. Identify your best content with easy-to-execute tests and get deep insights into your customers. With Adobe Experience Cloud, you can deliver the right experience to every customer, every time.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.

What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

What is an LLC?
Like a corporation, a limited liability company (or "LLC"), is a separate and distinct legal entity.  This means that an LLC can have its own tax identification number and bank account.  The primary advantage of an LLC is that its owners have "limited liability," meaning that, under most circumstances, the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the LLC.  For example, if an LLC is forced into bankruptcy, the owners will not be required to pay the LLC's debts with their own money.  If the assets of the LLC are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities, the creditors generally cannot look to the owners, managers or officers for relief.

An LLC can be taxed either as a "pass-through" entity, like a sole proprietorship or partnership, or as a regular corporation.  By default, an LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity, where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the LLC at their individual 
tax rates.  This is different from a regular C Corporation, which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders (the owners) as dividends.  When the corporation distributes profits, the stockholders 
also must pay income tax on these dividends.  Most LLC owners choose to have the profits pass-through so that taxes are only paid once on the profits.

When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.

For the definition and a complete list of  exceptions, see   RCW  82.04.192(3)(b). Also, for a  more detailed discussion on what a DAS, is see WAC  458-20-15503(203).
  What are data processing services? 
Data  processing services are primarily automated services provided to a business or  other organization where the primary object of the service is the systematic  performance of operations by the service provider, on data supplied in whole or  in part by the customer, to extract the required information in an appropriate  form or to convert the data to usable information. Data processing services  include check processing, image processing, form processing, survey processing,  payroll processing, claim processing, and similar activities. Charges for data  processing services are subject to service and other activities B&O tax as  a professional service (sales tax does not apply).
What are web site development services?
"Web  site development service" means the design and development of a web site  provided by a web site developer to a customer. Charges for web site  development services are subject to service and other activities B&O tax as  a professional service (sales tax does not apply).
What is digital data storage, hosting and back-up? 
"The  mere storage of digital products,  digital codes, computer software or master copies of software is excluded from  the definition of DAS. This exclusion  includes the provision of space on a server for web hosting or backing up data or  other information. Charges for digital storage, hosting and back-up services are subject to B&O  tax under the service and other activities classification (sales tax does not  apply).
What are online advertising services? 
"Advertising  services" means all services directly related to the creation,  preparation, production, or the dissemination of advertisements. Advertising  services include layout, art direction, graphic design, mechanical preparation,  production supervision, placement, and rendering advice to a client concerning  the best methods of advertising that client's products or services. Advertising  services also include search engine optimization, web campaign planning, the  acquisition of advertising space in the internet media, and the monitoring and  evaluation of web site traffic for purposes of determining the effectiveness of  an advertising campaign. Charges for online advertising services are subject to  B&O tax under the service and other activities classification (sales tax  does not apply).
 Services  that are primarily the result of human effort performed in response to a  customer request are not considered DAS.

Online marketplace related activities


    For  the definition and a complete list of exclusions, see RCW 82.04.192(3)(b). 
What are online marketplace related activities?
Online marketplace related  activities, which are services that allow the person receiving the services  to make online sales of products or services, digital or otherwise, using  either:

 (i) The  service provider's web site; or
(ii)  The service recipient's web site, but only when the service provider's  technology is used either to:
(A)  Create or host the service recipient's web site; or
(B)  Process orders from customers using the service recipient's web site.

What is remote access software  (RAS)?
RAS  is prewritten software provided remotely. In other words, the buyer pays  the seller for the right to access and use the prewritten software, which  resides on the seller’s server or the server of a third party. (An  Application Service Provider is an example of a business that may provide  RAS.) RAS is classified as a retail sale for B&O tax purposes and is  subject to sales or use tax. The purchase of prewritten software is exempt if  the purchaser uses the software to provide RAS.
What is a digital code and how  is it taxed?
Digital  code provides purchasers with the right to obtain one or more digital products.
 If  all the digital products available through the code are digital and have the  same tax treatment, the code is considered a digital code. Digital codes are taxed the  same way as the underlying digital product.
 If  the digital code provides the purchaser digital products that do not have the  same tax treatment, it is not a digital code.
 
 
How these laws apply
How are prewritten remote access  software keys or activation codes taxed?
The  sale of prewritten software subject to sales or use tax includes the sale or  charge made for a key or an enabling or activation code.
What is the value of the digital  product for use tax purposes?
The  value is the purchase price of the digital product. If the digital  product is acquired by means other than a purchase, the value of the digital  product is determined by the retail selling price of a similar digital  product.  
Are there any common digital  goods that are exempt from tax?
Yes.  Digital goods that are not offered for sale are exempt from tax when they are: 

Noncommercial  (such as personal e-mail communications). 
Created  solely for an internal audience. 
Created  solely for the business needs of the person who created the digital good and is  not the type of digital good that is offered for sale, such as business e-mail  communications.

When is a digital product,  digital code, or RAS used in the state of Washington for purposes of use tax?
A  digital good or digital code is used within this state when the consumer first  accesses, downloads, possesses, stores, opens, manipulates, or otherwise uses  it within this state. A DAS is used within this state when the consumer  first uses, enjoys, or otherwise receives the benefit of the service in this  state. RAS is used in this state when the consumer first accesses the  prewritten software in this state. 
How are sales of digital  products, digital codes, and remote access software sourced?
The  standard sourcing rules from the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement  (SSUTA) apply to the sourcing of digital products, digital codes, and RAS. Washington’s implementation of the SSUTA rule  is in RCW 82.32.730.
 The  sales of digital products, digital codes, and RAS are sourced the same as other  sales according to the following hierarchy:

The  seller’s place of business if the purchaser receives the digital product at the  seller’s place of business; 
If  not received at the seller’s place of business, the location where the  purchaser receives the digital product, digital code, or RAS; 
If  the location where the purchaser receives the digital product, digital code, or  RAS is not known, the purchaser’s address available in the seller’s business  records; 
If  no address is available in the seller’s business records, the purchaser’s  address obtained at the time of sale (e.g., purchaser’s payment instrument);  and 
If  no address is obtained at the time of sale, the address where the digital  product, digital code, or RAS is first made available for transmission by the  seller. 

Does placing digital products,  digital codes, or software on a server in Washington establish nexus?
Putting  a digital product on a server in Washington does not establish nexus. If an  out-of-state person owns, rents, or leases server equipment, then ownership  interest of the server equipment may be considered as a factor in determining  nexus.
How does B&O tax apply to  sales of digital products, digital codes, and RAS?
Taxpayers  with nexus in Washington who sell digital products, digital codes, or remote  access software sourced to Washington are subject to the B&O tax under the  Retailing classification on the gross proceeds of retail sales and the B&O  tax under the Wholesaling classification on the grossproceeds for wholesaling receipts. If digital products are  licensed to someone who is not an end user, then those gross receipts are  likely subject to the Royalties B&O tax. 
Is the production of digital  goods classified as manufacturing?
No.  The production of digital goods is not manufacturing.
 

Exclusions and exemptions
Exclusions, including telecommunications and internet  access, are not considered digital products even though they are transferred  electronically. These activities and items are excluded from the definition of  digital products. Their tax treatment is not changed by these laws. (See the Definition of Terms section above for more  examples of activities that are not considered digital goods and digital  automated services.) 
Digital products purchased for  resale or to become a part of a new product
Purchases  of digital products for resale or to be used as components of a new product for  sale are not subject to sales and use tax, but are subject to wholesaling  B&O tax on the seller. The purchaser must provide a reseller permit  or an exemption certificate.
Digital products given away for  free
There  is a use tax exemption for the recipient of digital products obtained free of  charge. There is also a sales and use tax exemption for the person purchasing  digital products, digital codes, or remote access software to give it away for  free. The purchaser must provide an exemption certificate to the seller. The  seller is also still subject to the Retailing B&O tax. 
Digital goods purchased for a  business purpose
If  a business purchases a digital good (only digital goods, NOT digital automated  services or remote access software) for business purposes, then the purchase is  exempt from sales tax. Digital codes can be purchased exempt from sales tax as  well, as long as only digital goods are obtained through the use of the code  and the digital goods will be used solely for business purposes. The seller is still subject to Retailing  B&O tax on these sales. Also, see our Special Notice on the sales tax  exemption for Purchases  of Standard Financial Information by Qualifying International Investment  Management Companies. 
For use within and outside  Washington 
Businesses  purchasing digital products that may be used concurrently within and outside  Washington are entitled to the multiple points of use (MPU) sales tax  exemption. The buyer must provide the exemption certificate and pay use tax as  explained below. The MPU exemption does not apply to purchases for  personal use. The seller is still subject to Retailing B&O tax on  sales.
 Based  on the buyer’s records, the buyer may apportion the use tax in proportion to  the in-state to out-of-state users.

Number of users (e.g.  employees or agents) in this state 
Divide it by the  number of users (e.g. employees or agents) everywhere.  Thus, even if  delivery of the product occurs in Washington, a person eligible for the MPU  exemption owes use tax only on the apportioned value. The Department may  authorize or require an alternative method of apportionment, supported by the  taxpayer’s records, that fairly reflects the proportion of in-state to  out-of-state use. 

Remote access software
There  is an exemption for the purchase of prewritten software by the person who will  provide the software remotely. The seller is still subject to Retailing B&O  tax on these sales. 
M&E exemption of digital  goods
“Machinery  and equipment” (M&E) includes digital goods. Digital goods used  directly in a manufacturing operation are exempt under the M&E exemptions,  provided all of the requirements of the exemption are met.
Television or radio broadcasts
Television  and radio broadcasts of regular programming are not subject to sales or use tax  and are subject to the Service & Other Activities B&O tax. However, if a broadcaster sells programming on a pay-per-program basis that  allows the buyer to access a library of programs at any time for a specific  charge, then sales tax and Retailing B&O tax applies.
 There  is an exemption for cable companies’ sales of pay-per-program programming if cable  companies are subject to a franchise fee on the gross revenue from the  sale. Satellite providers have a federal exemption only from the local portion  of the sales and use tax when they sell programming on a pay-per-program basis.  Satellite providers do not have a state sales and use tax exemption because  they do not pay franchise fees and therefore their sales are subject to the  state portion of the sales tax rate. RCW  82.04.192(11).

Online enrollment, sign up with digital forms and e-signatures | Adobe
















































Deliver the same great experience on every channel. Read The Digital Enrollment Imperative ›








 
 
Sign-ups made simple.
 
 








You want an enrollment experience that’s secure, compliant, and so painless that customers might actually find it refreshing. You also need to give them the flexibility to start on a mobile device, switch to another device, and then finish up wherever they are next. Today no one wants to deal with complicated paper-based forms. And everyone expects a great experience on every device. Going digital can save you time, money, and allow you to personalize enrollment so it works better.











 
Get your enrollment rolling.

















 




 
Your customers are on the move, so your enrollment experiences need to be too. If you have clunky web or paper-like experiences on mobile devices, your customers may switch to pricy in-person or telephone options — or give up altogether. But when you offer seamless, consistent experiences across all devices, enrollment is a breeze.










 




    



 Adobe can help. With Adobe Experience Manager, you can easily create the same engaging customer experiences for mobile, tablets, and desktops — and deliver them without writing code. Using the same content, Experience Manager creates mobile-optimized sites, pages, forms, and documents that automatically adjust for all devices. Customers can start a transaction on a smartphone, continue on a desktop, and then complete it on a tablet — picking up right where they left off. And if any of them drop off along the way, Adobe Campaign helps you re-engage them with targeted emails.
  



Learn about Experience Manager




Learn about Campaign ›
















 
Make your forms safe and sound.

















 




You’ve heard that electronic signatures can help make enrollment convenient and fast for your customers. Yet some departments still think paper forms and signatures are safer than digital. What they don’t realize is that e-signatures can streamline sign-ups and processing, saving you time and money while being completely secure and compliant.











 




    



 Adobe can help. With Experience Manager Forms and Adobe Sign, you can make your enrollment process paperless, compliant, and secure. You can simplify forms by prefilling data from existing customer or social media profiles. Meet the most stringent security and web accessibility requirements and support the highest level of signer authentication. Say goodbye to printing, scanning, and postage costs. Plus, you’ll find it easier to adapt to changing compliance requirements without reprinting anything.
  



Learn about Adobe Sign




Learn about Experience Manager Forms ›
 






 










 
Move from paper planes to digital jets.

















 




It’s time-consuming and costly to have developers create and update your forms — especially if you have multiple versions that have to work well on the web, in mobile, and in apps. You’d like to take control and have the ability to create and manage digital forms on your own more efficiently, getting you to market faster.











 








 Adobe can help. With Experience Manager Forms, you can quickly create and manage forms that are consistent on every device. The simple drag-and-drop tools make it easy to define and apply styles, colors, and fonts. Localize content and insert logic rules. Even set dynamic behavior — without coding. After forms are submitted, automated workflows connect them to back-end systems and save you processing time.
  



Learn about Experience Manager Forms
















 
Get up close and personal with your customers.

















 




It’s important to know exactly how your customers experience enrollment. Of course, you want to understand how long it takes to complete an application, which groups of customers are interacting at each step, and where they’re dropping off. These are the kinds of insights that will help you personalize the customer experience, increase conversion, and drive sales.











 




    



 Adobe can help. With Adobe Analytics, you can get real-time insights into how customers experience your enrollment. See where they’re engaged and learn where they drop off. Then use Adobe Target to test multiple versions of a form and encourage cross-selling with personalized approval letters, welcome kits, and promotions.

Learn about Target ›














 
Streamlined enrollment. At your service.

















 




Today’s consumers want a streamlined sign-up process they can start and complete on any device. In many industries, customer interactions involve the exchange of a lot of information, including when customers sign up, onboard, and apply for services. Delivering the most modern enrollment experience requires the right combination of data, insights, and tools.











 




Why Adobe.



 Adobe gives you everything you need to deliver relevant, personalized enrollment experiences. Create them for desktops and mobile devices all in one location — without coding. Build easy-to-complete forms with legally binding electronic signatures thanks to integration with Adobe Sign. Identify your best content with easy-to-execute tests and get deep insights into your customers. With Adobe Experience Cloud, you can deliver the right experience to every customer, every time.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

What is an LLC?
Like a corporation, a limited liability company (or "LLC"), is a separate and distinct legal entity.  This means that an LLC can have its own tax identification number and bank account.  The primary advantage of an LLC is that its owners have "limited liability," meaning that, under most circumstances, the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the LLC.  For example, if an LLC is forced into bankruptcy, the owners will not be required to pay the LLC's debts with their own money.  If the assets of the LLC are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities, the creditors generally cannot look to the owners, managers or officers for relief.

An LLC can be taxed either as a "pass-through" entity, like a sole proprietorship or partnership, or as a regular corporation.  By default, an LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity, where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the LLC at their individual 
tax rates.  This is different from a regular C Corporation, which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders (the owners) as dividends.  When the corporation distributes profits, the stockholders 
also must pay income tax on these dividends.  Most LLC owners choose to have the profits pass-through so that taxes are only paid once on the profits. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential personal and business legal documents themselves.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
