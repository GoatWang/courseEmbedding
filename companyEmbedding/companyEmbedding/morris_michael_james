I went to school and ran track with Mikey.  He was one of the hardest workers I've ever known.  Mikey and I always played cards to pass the time and I never remember him being anything but polite and honest.  I feel nothing but sorrow for his family but I know he is with God watching over them.

SHORT HILLS, N.J., Feb. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Michael James Enterprises, Inc. (OTC: MJTV),  delivered the first set of samples of its 4 product acne kit to the creator of the patented technology at the renowned Ivy League institution and received confirmation that the formulations are properly combined. MJTV also went live with its Facebook page which can be viewed by going to the following link www.facebook.com/MJTV.Inc
Konstantinos M. Lahanas, Ph.D, of The Lahanas Group reported  that the next step in the formulation process is to add in aromas and resubmit for final approval prior to moving onto the next steps.  
Michael James Enterprises CEO James M. Farinella stated, "Reaching the milestone of an approved formulation from our patent holder is a very significant achievement for MJTV. The team set out to develop a disruptive product offering and we are now ready to prove we did so."
The next step after final approval is to choose industry-leading companies to begin independent third party benchmarking. This process includes elective lab testing, comparative use studies against leading competitors and before and after pictures.
