                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Important SafetyInformation
Full PrescribingInformation



Testosterone Gel 1% is available only by prescription
    Warning of Secondary Exposure to Testosterone:  Virilization has been reported in children who were secondarily exposed to testosterone gel.  Children should avoid contact with      unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using testosterone gel.  Healthcare providers should advise patients to strictly adhere to recommended instructions for use.
    Indication: Testosterone Gel 1% is used as a replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.  Safety and    efficacy of testosterone gel in males less than 18 years old have not been established.  Testosterone Gel 1% is not intended for use in women.  Topical testosterone products may     have different doses, strengths, or application instructions that may result in different systemic exposure.
    











Important Safety Information

Alogliptin is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to alogliptin-containing products such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, or severe cutaneous adverse reactions.
Acute pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute
pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue Alogliptin.
Hypersensitivity: There have been postmarketing reports of serious
hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with Alogliptin such as
anaphylaxis, angioedema or severe cutaneous adverse reactions. In such
cases, promptly discontinue Alogliptin, assess for other potential causes,
institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative
treatment for diabetes. Use caution in a patient with a history of
angioedema with another DPP-4i because it is unknown whether such
patients will be predisposed to angioedema.
Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal.
Causality cannot be excluded. Baseline liver test panel is recommended.
If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt Alogliptin and assess patient
for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization.
Do not restart Alogliptin if liver injury is confirmed and no alternative
etiology can be found.
Hypoglycemia: Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause
hypoglycemia. A lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be
required to minimize the risk when used in combination with Alogliptin.
Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients
taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain
and discontinue drug if appropriate.
Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing
conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Alogliptin or
any other anti-diabetic drug.
Most common adverse reactions (4% of patients treated with Alogliptin
25 mg and more frequently than in patients who received placebo) were
nasopharyngitis (4.4%), headache (4.2%), and upper respiratory tract
infection (4.2%).

Patients taking Alogliptin should contact their health care professionals right
away if they develop signs and symptoms of heart failure such as:

Unusual shortness of breath during daily activities
Trouble breathing when lying down
Tiredness, weakness, or fatigue
Weight gain with swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, or stomach
Patients should not stop taking their medicine without first talking to their
health care professionals.

Patients should not stop taking their medicine without first talking to their
health care professionals.
Indication
Alogliptin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve
glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is not for
treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.
Please see Full Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide for Alogliptin.

Consumer Healthcare
Over The Counter (OTC)


Over The Counter (OTC)
When you shop in any store, whether it's a WalMart, Walgreens, Kroger,  or some other store, you have a choice to make: Buy the national brand product such as Tylenol® or select the store-brand alternative that is next to it. Perrigo manufactures store-brand products that meet or exceed quality standards set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Your store-brand purchases perform like the national brands. In fact, healthcare professionals agree that store brands represent your best value. Be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist about the quality of store brands. Compare the active ingredient(s) and performance of store-brands with their national-brand counterparts.








The future growth in OTCs will, in part, be fueled by Rx-to-OTC switches. Perrigo strives to be first to market with products that will switch to OTC status.

About Us
Perrigo History


Our History
The Early Years
In 1887 Luther Perrigo, the proprietor of a general store and apple-drying business, had the idea to package and distribute patented medicines and household items for country stores. Located in Allegan, Michigan, the L. Perrigo Company enjoyed steady growth and, by the early 1920s, Perrigo was exceeding the needs of its rural store customers throughout the Midwest. 
Along the way, the company began leveraging the "private label" concept as a way to enhance customer loyalty. For no additional cost, Perrigo offered to imprint the individual store's name on the labels of epsom salts, sweet oil, bay rum and dozens of other wet and dry goods stocked in general stores.
Deep Roots in Manufacturing Excellence
Perrigo opened its first manufacturing facility in Allegan, Michigan in 1921 and signed its first, large private-label customer in the mid-1930s, paving the way for its conversion from a re-packager of home remedies to a manufacturer of affordable health care products. This shift in strategic direction drove Perrigo's growth over the next several decades and became the foundation for the Company's mission today.
A Growing Business
Perrigo's growth was driven further by the advent of Rx-to-over-the-counter ("OTC") switches, where prescription products began to become available over the counter. These Rx-to-OTC switches provided Perrigo with opportunities to launch new store brand versions of products such as Advil®, Tylenol®, Flonase®, Allegra®, Prilosec®, Nicorette® and many more. The store brand concept also began to gain popularity with retailers seeking to improve profitability and increase customer loyalty.  
As Perrigo's consumer healthcare presence continued to expand, the Company began to pursue partnerships and acquisitions of established businesses in order to expand its geographic footprint and product offerings. In 1997, Perrigo completed its first acquisition outside of the U.S. when it acquired Quimica y Farmacia (also known as Quifa), a Mexican-based private label OTC company. Perrigo then expanded further by adding businesses in the U.K. and Australia, which provided the company access to important new markets across the globe. 
Perrigo's product portfolio expanded in 2005 with the addition of Agis Industries, which added a number of generic prescription pharmaceutical products, primarily focused on difficult to manufacture topical foams, lotions and gels.  Over the subsequent years, the addition of new store brand OTC categories such as infant formula and animal health solidified Perrigo as a global leader in Quality Affordable Healthcare Products®. 
In 2013, Perrigo acquired Elan Corporation plc, which provided a platform for further global expansion. In 2015, Perrigo completed the acquisition of Belgium-based Omega Pharma NV, one of the largest OTC healthcare companies in Europe. This addition to the Perrigo portfolio added a pan-European-based organization focused on providing high-quality branded OTC products to consumers in approximately 30 countries.
Today
Today, Perrigo is a leading global healthcare company, focused on providing value to its customers and consumers by delivering Quality Affordable Healthcare Products®. Perrigo has built a unique business model that is best described as the convergence of a fast-moving consumer goods company, a high-quality pharmaceutical manufacturing organization and a world-class supply chain network. Perrigo is the world's largest manufacturer of OTC healthcare products and supplier of infant formulas for the store brand market. The Company also is a leading provider of branded OTC products throughout Europe and the U.S., as well as a leading producer of "extended topical" prescription drugs. Perrigo, headquartered in Ireland, sells its products primarily in North America and Europe, as well as in other markets, including Australia, Israel and China.

The Tender Offer is not conditioned upon any minimum amount of Notes being tendered, and the Tender Offer may be amended, extended, terminated or withdrawn in whole or with respect to any one or more series of Notes. The amounts of each series of Notes that are purchased on any settlement date will be determined in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Levels and Series Caps, as applicable, set in the table above and on the front cover of the Offer to Purchase, with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 6 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level.

 (1) The applicable page on Bloomberg from which Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC will quote the bid-side prices of the applicable Reference U.S. Treasury Security. 




The Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 27, 2017, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the "Expiration Time"). Holders of Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 13, 2017, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the "Early Tender Deadline") to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined below) for their tendered Notes, which includes an early tender payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase (the "Early Tender Premium"). After such time, the Notes may not be withdrawn except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law. The initial settlement date is expected to be June 15, 2017, and the final settlement date is expected to be June 28, 2017, in each case subject to change without notice.
The "Total Consideration" for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes of any series tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable fixed spread specified for such series over the yield based on the bid-side price of the applicable U.S. Treasury Security specified for such series in the table above and on the front cover of the Offer to Purchase. Holders of Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration for such Notes, which includes the Early Tender Premium. Holders of Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline and on or before the Expiration Time and accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Tender Consideration for such Notes, which equals the applicable Total Consideration for such Notes minus the Early Tender Premium. Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on their purchased Notes from, and including, the last interest payment date for such Notes to, but excluding, the applicable settlement date (the "Accrued Interest").
The Tender Offer is not conditioned upon any minimum amount of Notes being tendered, and the Tender Offer may be amended, extended, terminated or withdrawn in whole or with respect to any one or more series of Notes. The amounts of each series of Notes that are purchased on any settlement date will be determined in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Levels (the "Acceptance Priority Levels") and Series Caps (the "Series Caps"), as applicable, set forth in the table above and on the front cover of the Offer to Purchase, with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 6 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level. We will only accept for purchase Notes up to a combined aggregate principal amount of $1,400,000,000 (the "Maximum Amount"), subject to the Acceptance Priority Levels and the applicable Series Caps.
Perrigo and Perrigo Finance reserve the right to increase the Maximum Amount. If Holders tender more Notes in the Tender Offer than they expect to be accepted for purchase by Perrigo and/or Perrigo Finance based on a lower Acceptance Priority Level or subject to the Series Caps for the Notes being tendered, and if Perrigo and/or Perrigo Finance subsequently accept more than such Holders expected of such Notes tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the applicable withdrawal deadline, such Holders will not be able to withdraw any of their previously tendered Notes. Accordingly, Holders should not tender any Notes that they do not wish to be accepted for purchase.
All Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or before the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any tendered Notes having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted in the Tender Offer, and all Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted in the Tender Offer, subject in all circumstances to the Series Caps. However, Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase in priority to Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline, even if the Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than the Notes tendered prior to the Early Tender Deadline, subject to the Series Caps. 
If purchasing all of the tendered Notes of a series of Notes of an applicable Acceptance Priority Level on any settlement date would cause the Maximum Amount or the Series Caps (as may be amended), as applicable, to be exceeded, the amount of that series of Notes purchased on that settlement date will be prorated based on the aggregate principal amount of that series of Notes tendered in respect of that settlement date such that the Maximum Amount and/or the Series Caps, as applicable, will not be exceeded. Furthermore, if the Tender Offer is fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Deadline, Holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Deadline will not have any of their Notes accepted for payment.
Subject to applicable law, the Tender Offer may be amended, extended, terminated or withdrawn with respect to one or more series of Notes. If the Tender Offer is terminated with respect to any series of Notes without Notes of such series being accepted for purchase, Notes of such series tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer will promptly be returned to the tendering holders. Notes tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer and not purchased due to the priority acceptance procedures or due to proration will be returned to the tendering holders promptly following the Expiration Time or, if the Tender Offer is fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Deadline, promptly following the Early Tender Deadline.
The completion of the Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase. There can be no assurance that the Tender Offer will be consummated or that any failure to consummate the Tender Offer will not have a negative effect on the market price and liquidity of the Notes.
This press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an acceptance of securities. No offer, solicitation, purchase or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful. The Tender Offer is being made solely pursuant to terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase.
Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are serving as the Lead Dealer Managers in connection with the Tender Offer. Wells Fargo Securities, LLC is serving as the Co-Dealer Manager in connection with the Tender Offer. Questions regarding the Tender Offer may be directed to Barclays Capital Inc. at (800) 438-3242 (toll free) or (212) 528-7581 (collect), Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at (800) 558-3745 (toll free) or (212) 723-6106 (collect) or to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC at (800) 624-1808 (toll free) or (212) 761-1057 (collect). Requests for the Offer to Purchase or the documents incorporated by reference therein may be directed to D.F.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this press release are "forward-looking statements." These statements relate to future events or the Company's future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements of the Company or its industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "would," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While the Company believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, including the timing and expense to complete the Tender Offer. These and other important factors, including those discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as the Company's subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

History[edit]
The L. Perrigo Company was founded in 1887 in Allegan, Michigan, by Luther and Charles Perrigo, who ran a country general store .[3] In 1991 Perrigo had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
In March 2005 the firm acquired Agis Industries Ltd. (TASE:AGIS), an Israel-based generic pharmaceuticals company in an $850 million transaction. Agis was founded in 1983 by Mori Arkin who developed his father's small drug import business into a multinational generic pharmaceutical company. As a result of the acquisition Arkin owns 9% of Perrigo, and was appointed as Vice Chairman of the company.[4]
In April 2015, Perrigo received a buy-out offer from Mylan for a fee of $29 billion.[5] In May 2016 Perrigo investors sued the company over misleading statements made during Mylans hostile takeover attempt.[6] Those false statements are said to have persuaded shareholders to vote against the deal.[7][8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On 9 January 2008, the firm acquired Galpharm Healthcare, Ltd., a supplier of over-the-counter store brand pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.[9] On 16 September 2008, the firm acquired J.B. Laboratories.[10] On 6 October 2008, it acquired Laboratorios Diba S.A., enabling the company to market its products in Mexico.[11] On 13 November 2008, it acquired Unico Holdings, a manufacturer of store brand pediatric electrolytes, enemas and feminine hygiene products for retail consumers in the U.S.[12]

History[edit]
The L. Perrigo Company was founded in 1887 in Allegan, Michigan, by Luther and Charles Perrigo, who ran a country general store .[3] In 1991 Perrigo had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
In March 2005 the firm acquired Agis Industries Ltd. (TASE:AGIS), an Israel-based generic pharmaceuticals company in an $850 million transaction. Agis was founded in 1983 by Mori Arkin who developed his father's small drug import business into a multinational generic pharmaceutical company. As a result of the acquisition Arkin owns 9% of Perrigo, and was appointed as Vice Chairman of the company.[4]
In April 2015, Perrigo received a buy-out offer from Mylan for a fee of $29 billion.[5] In May 2016 Perrigo investors sued the company over misleading statements made during Mylans hostile takeover attempt.[6] Those false statements are said to have persuaded shareholders to vote against the deal.[7][8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On 9 January 2008, the firm acquired Galpharm Healthcare, Ltd., a supplier of over-the-counter store brand pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.[9] On 16 September 2008, the firm acquired J.B.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
