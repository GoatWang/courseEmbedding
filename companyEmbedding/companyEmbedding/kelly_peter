He attended the University of Notre Dame and was the first member of his family to complete college. He then attended Georgetown University Medical School followed by his Internal Medicine internship in Worcester. He practiced family medicine in Palmer at Wing Memorial Hospital for one year.RadiologistUltrasoundPeter J. Kelly, M.D. performs the most advanced cataract surgery known as phacoemulsification. The surgery is performed on an outpatient basis under local or topical anesthesia. A complete physical examination is required prior to surgery to ensure the patients overall health. During surgery, using high energy sound waves through an ultrasound emitting probe, the cataract is broken into tiny, microscopic pieces and gently suctioned from the eye. The procedure is performed through a small incision which is self sealing and requires no stitching. Not only is this safer for the patient, but it also produces less discomfort and recovery is quicker. An artificial replacement lens is then inserted through the incision and unfolded in place. This intraocular lens focuses light rays directly onto the retina to produce clear, sharp images just as the natural lens did. Most people experience improved vision immediately following surgery and are able to return to their normal activities within a couple of days.OphthalmologistsEye ExamYou may call for an appointment Monday through Friday between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. When you call, please tell us if you are scheduling a routine eye exam or if your visit will be about a specific problem.Cataract SurgeryTo find out if you are a candidate for cataract surgery and which lens is best for you, you will need a complete eye exam by Dr. Kelly. Please call the office at 413-283-3511, option 2, to schedule an appointment.GlaucomaThere is no cure for glaucoma – yet. However, medication or surgery can slow or prevent further vision loss. The appropriate treatment depends on the type of glaucoma among other factors. Early detection is vital to stopping the progress of the disease.OphthalmologyDeciding to specialize in Ophthalmology, he then completed his residency at Tufts New England Medical Center in Boston where he was Chief Resident in his final year.Macular DegenerationGlaucoma is the leading cause of adult blindness after age-related macular degeneration. It is a group of eye diseases that gradually steal sight without warning. In the early stages, there may be no obvious symptoms. Vision loss is caused by damage to the optic nerve. The main cause of this optic nerve damage is high pressure within the eye, also known as intraocular pressure or IOP. Although IOP is clearly a risk factor, other factors are involved because even people with “normal” levels of pressure can experience vision loss from glaucoma.Laser Eye SurgeryDr. Kelly is one of the founders and President of the Cataract and Laser Center – a state of the art surgical center that provides the latest technology for eye surgery in a relaxed and professional environment.CataractsA cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye which interferes with light passing through to the retina. This clouding causes images to appear blurred or fuzzy and can be compared to a window that is frosted. Night halos, excessive glare or double vision are other common complaints. Cataracts are often the result of the natural aging process and are most commonly found in people over the age of 60. Most age-related cataracts progress gradually over a period of years. However, cataracts can be diagnosed earlier as a result of disease, trauma to the eye, medications or they can be inherited.EndocrinologistDiabetes CareDiabetic RetinopathyDiabetes occurs when your body does not generate enough insulin to properly regulate your blood sugar level. This disease, which can occur in both adults and children, poses many threats to your vision. Diabetic retinopathy is the deteriorating effect that diabetes has on your eyes. Patients who have been diagnosed with diabetes need to have regular comprehensive eye exams by an ophthalmologist to monitor and properly treat their diabetic retinopathy.InternistsInternal MedicinePsychiatristsMental HealthProtected health information (PHI), about you, is maintained as a written and/or electronic record of your contacts or visits for healthcare services with our practice.

The stories were fairy tales starring Peter Wheat, an elf-sized boy who lived in a hollow tree on the edge of a wheat field where he and the Little Folk battle Dragonel, Queen of the Hornets. Reprints the first 16 complete Peter Wheat comic books; in-depth essay by comics historian and Walt Kelly expert Dr. Thomas Andrae; afterword by Trina Robbins.

Grace Kelly (November 12, 1929 – September 14, 1982), American actress who, after marrying Prince Rainier III, became the Princess of Monaco, original 8 x 10 glossy photograph by celebrity photographer Peter Warrack. Vintage photograph from the original negative. Printed by Warrack as part of his personal archive. Previously unpublished.
In his early 20's, Peter Warrack lived in London, Rome, and Athens working for entertainment magazines and writing articles about events that he attended, like the Cannes Film Festival. It was during this period of time that his interest in photography began to develop. Over the years, Peter began to amass a very extensive collection of photographs of people he met. He attended many events and met many famed individuals of the time. He always took the time to research people before meeting them and was able to talk with them about their careers, their travels and even their families. This impressed them and they felt comfortable in his company; many became personal friends over the years. Their comfort level always translated into the way he captured the personality of those individuals, as he would engage them in easy, friendly conversation while taking candid photos. Until now his personal collection and archive has been completely unpublished.
Verso bears official "Peter Warrack Archive" ink stamping, else blank and clean. In very good condition.
Provenance: From the Peter Warrack Estate.

Satisfaction 100% Guaranteed

family and friends of Peter Kelly can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.
