Fund Investment Objectives











                                        Implements a quantitative-based investment strategy designed to create and manage a diversified portfolio of convertible securities. Management is anchored by a propriety valuation model that identifies statistically undervalued convertible securities with attractive risk/reward characteristics. Currently intends to invest at least 80% of its assets in a diversified portfolio of convertible securities with an investment grade average credit rating. The remaining portion of the assets will be invested in a lower rated and special situation convertible security. These securities present a unique opportunity to achieve superior risk adjusted returns in an inefficient segment of the convertible securities market.
Please note: 2% Management Fee on first $20 million, 1.5% on assets in excess of $20 million and 1% over $70 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                         

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of                                   
Zazove Convertible Securities Fund, Inc.                                        
Incline Village, Nevada                                                         

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities            
of Zazove Convertible Securities Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including             
the schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2015, and the related           
statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the            
statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the            
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five            
years in the period then ended.  These financial statements and                 
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management.           
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial                  
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.                        

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the                 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those               
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain                  
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and                 
financial highlights are free of material misstatement.                         
The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,               
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.                      
Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial            
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are                    
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of                    
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal               
control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such              
opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence           
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,             
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates              
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial                 
statement presentation.  Our procedures included confirmation of                
securities owned as of December 31, 2015, by correspondence with the            
custodian and brokers. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable          
basis for our opinion.                                                          

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial                         
highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material                    
respects,the financial position of Zazove Convertible Securities                
Fund, Inc. as of December 31, 2015, the results of its operations and           
its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets           
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial           
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in              
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United          
States of America.

used in preparing the financial statements.                                   

Use of Estimates-The preparation of financial statements                        
requires the Fund's management to make estimates and assumptions                
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and                  
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the              
financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and                  
decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting                    
period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.                      

Valuation of Investments-The valuation of the Fund's investments is             
in accordance with policies and procedures adopted by and under                 
the supervision of the Board of Directors. Investments are recorded             
at fair value.                                                                  

Common stock, certain convertible preferred securities and certain              
derivatives that are traded on national securities exchanges are                
valued at the last reported sales price or, if there are no sales,              
at the mean between the bid and ask prices. Common stock, certain               
convertible preferred securities and certain derivatives traded                 
over the counter are valued at the average of the highest current               
independent bid and lowest current independent offer reported upon              
the close of trading on that day.                                               

Convertible bond securities, corporate bond securities, certain                 
convertible preferred securities and certain derivatives                        
are valued at the mid-point of independent bid and offer quotes                 
received from dealers or brokers who make markets in such securities.           

Securities for which market quotations are not available are valued             
at fair value as determined in good faith by the Investment                     
Advisor with the oversight of the Board of Directors pursuant to                
Board of Directors' approved procedures. In such cases, fair value              
is derived based on all relevant facts and circumstances including,             
among other things, fixed income and option pricing models and                  
conversion value.                                                               

Cash and Cash Equivalents-Cash and cash equivalents represents cash             
held by the Fund's custodian.                                                   

Investment Transactions and Income-Security transactions                        
are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses from sales             
of securities (including securities sold short) are determined on               
an identified cost basis.  Dividend income and expense is                       
recognized on the ex-dividend date.  Interest income and expense                
are recognized on the accrual basis.  Bond discount is accreted                 
and bond premium is amortized over the expected maturity of each                
applicable security using the effective interest method, as                     
long as the collectability is not in doubt and the security                     
is performing in accordance with its contractual terms.                         

Indemnifications - Under the Fund's organizational documents, the               
Fund is obligated to indemnify its directors, officers and Investment           
Advisor against certain liabilities relating to the business or                 
activities undertaken by them on behalf of the Fund.  In addition,              
in the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts                
that provide for general indemnification to other parties.                      
The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown                 
as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund           
that have not yet occurred.  However, the Fund has not had prior                
claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification provisions                   
and expects the risk of loss to be remote.                                      

3.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS                                                    

FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ("Topic 820"), defines               
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value                    
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.                          

Various inputs are used to determine the value of the Fund's                    
investments. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels              
listed below:                                                                   

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical                 
securities                                          
Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including                
quoted prices for similiar securities, interest     
rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)        
Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's         
own assumptions in determining the fair value of    
investments)                                        

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not                 
necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing                 
in those securities.                                                            

The following table summarizes the inputs used to value the Fund's              
investments as of December 31, 2015:

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net change in appreciation            
(depreciation) included in net assets related to Level 3 investments            
still held at the reporting date are as follows:

The Fund's policy is to recognize transfers between Levels at the               
end of the reporting period. For the year ended December 31, 2015,              
there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.                                 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, a lack of market                          
liquidity caused a level 2 common stock to be transferred into                  
Level 3. In addition, a Level 3 commom stock was transferred                    
to Level 1 common stock as a result of a recapitalization                       
during the year ended December 31, 2015.                                        

FASB Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-04 requires the following         
disclosures about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities             
classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy: the valuation            
process used by the reporting entity and quantitative information               
about the unobservable inputs used in a fair value measurement.                 

The following table presents the quantitative information about the             
significant unobservable inputs and valuation techniques utilized to            
determine the fair value of the Fund's Level 3 investments as of                
December 31, 2015. The table includes Level 3 investments with                  
values derived from third parties. Such investments are primarily               
based on broker/dealer quotes for which there is a lack of transparency         
as to inputs used to develop the valuations. The quantitative detail of         
these unobservable inputs is neither provided nor reasonably available          
to the Fund.

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement           
of the Fund's Level 3 convertible bonds is a discount for lack of liquidity.    
A significant and reasonable increase or decrease in the liquidity discount     
would result in a significant decrease or increase in the fair value            
measurement.                                                                    

The valuation process of Level 3 securities follows the valuation of            
investments policy as disclosed in footnote 2.                                  

4. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING                                                      

The Fund follows the provisions of FASB ASC topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging  
("Topic 815"), which requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and      
strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value     
amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about     
credit risk related to contingent features in derivative agreements.            

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Fund held                   
warrants which are considered derivative instruments under Topic 815.           
Warrants are convertible at the holder's option into a fixed number             
of shares of the issuer's common stock upon payment of the exercise             
price and are treated as convertible securities by the Fund. Warrants           
held by the Fund were either purchased or received pursuant to a                
restructuring or exchange transaction. Equity price is the primary risk         
exposure of warrants. Net realized gain on 185,977 warrants was $809,221        
and is included in net realized gain on investments on the statement of         
operations. Net change in unrealized depreciation on 1,242,333 warrants         
was $4,610,088 and is included in net change in unrealized depreciation         
of investments on the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2015, the     
Fund held 1,056,356 warrants with fair value of $2,017,437 which is included    
in investments on the statement of assets and liabilities.                      

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, the fund held call options      
which are considered derivative instruments under Topic 815. Call options       
are an agreement that gives the Fund the right (but not the obligation)         
to buy a common stock, bond, commodity or other instrument at a specified       
price within a specified time period. Equity price is the primary risk          
exposure of call options. Net realized loss on 15,081 call options

5.   CAPITAL SHARE TRANSACTIONS                                                 

The Fund is authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of common               
stock, $0.01 par value.  Shareholders are entitled to one vote per              
share on all corporate issues put to vote of the shareholders,                  
although the Fund does not contemplate holding annual meetings to               
elect directors or for any other purpose.                                       

Upon approval of the Board of Directors, shares may be purchased as             
of the first business day of each month at the then net asset value             
per share. All subscription funds received after the first business             
day of the month will be tracked as subscriptions received in                   
advance until the beginning of the following month, at which time               
shares will be issued and the subscription will be recorded                     
as a component os net assets.                                                   

On a quarterly basis, the Fund will offer to repurchase no less                 
than 5% and no more than 25% of the Fund's outstanding shares at                
the then net asset value per share.  Notice of the terms and                    
conditions of each quarterly repurchase offer are sent to the                   
shareholders in advance of the offer. On November 18, 2015, the                 
Fund offered to repurchase shares as of December 31, 2015, which                
are reflected as capital shares redeemed on the statement of assets             
and liabilities. The Fund may impose a 2% fee on the redemption of              
fund shares held for less than one year. This fee is intended                   
to compensate the Fund for expenses related to such redemption.                 
Shares are redeemed by treating the shares first acquired by                    
a shareholder as being redeemed prior to shares acquired by such                
shareholders thereafter. There were no redemption fees charged                  
during 2015.                                                                    

Distributions from the Fund are recorded on the ex-distribution                 
date. All ordinary and capital gain distributions are automatically             
reinvested in Shares at the net asset value on the ex-distribution              
date unless Shareholders elect in writing to receive such distributions         
in cash.                                                                        

In the case of the termination of the Fund, distributions to the                
shareholders will be made in proportion to their respective share               
ownership after the payment of all Fund creditors.

to those prevailing in an arm's length trancaction.                             

The Fund bears all normal direct costs and expenses of its                      
operations including:  management fees; brokerage commissions;                  
custodian fees; transfer agency fees; legal, audit, accounting and

communications with shareholders. The custodian fees and transfer               
agent fees are paid to UMB Bank, N.A.                                           

The overall responsibility for the management and operation of the              
Fund is vested in the Board of Directors (the "Board").  The Board              
consists of four directors: Gene T. Pretti, Andrew J. Goodwin III,              
Jack L. Hansen, and Peter A. Lechman.  Each of the three directors              
who are not affiliated with the Investment Advisor received                     
$5,000 for their service to the Fund during 2015.                               

Gene T. Pretti, President, and Steven M. Kleiman, Secretary and                 
Treasurer, are the principal officers of the Fund and are                       
responsible for the day-to-day supervision of the business and                  
affairs of the Fund.  Steven M. Kleiman is the Fund's                           
Chief Compliance Officer and is responsible for administering the               
Fund's compliance policies and procedures. Except for certain                   
actions requiring the approval of the shareholders or the Board of              
Directors, the principal officers of the Fund have the power and                
authority to take all actions deemed necessary and appropriate to               
pursue the Fund's objective.                                                    

Shareholders in the Fund will be unable to exercise any management              
functions.  There will not be any shareholder vote unless                       
required by the Investment Company Act of 1940.                                 

7.   INCOME TAXES                                                               

FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("Topic 740"), provides guidance for           
how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented           
and disclosed in the financial statements. Topic 740 prescribes the             
minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet in connection            
with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or              
expected to be taken by an entity before being measured and recognized          
in the financial statements. Topic 740 requires the evaluation of tax           
positions taken in the course of preparing the Fund's tax returns to            
determine whether the tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being         
sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions            
not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be                  
recorded as a tax expense in the current year. The Fund has not taken           
any tax positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold.          
The tax years 2012-2015 remain subject to examination by the Internal           
Revenue Service.                                                                

It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements for qualification              
as a registered investment company as defined in Subchapter M of the            
Internal Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all                       
of its taxable income and capital gains to the Fund's shareholders.             
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes has been made.                 

The amount of distributions from net investment income and net realized         
capital gain are determined in accordance with federal income tax               
regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally              
accepted in the United States. Book to tax differences are primarily            
attributable to tax rules regarding contingent payment debt instruments         
and market discount bonds. To the extent these book to tax                      
differences are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified              
among paid-in surplus, accumulated undistributed net realized gain              
(loss) on investments and accumulated net                                       
investment income (loss). Accordingly, at December 31,2015,                     
reclassifications were recorded to decrease accumulated                         
undistributed net investment loss by $1,542,698, decrease                       
accumulated net realized gains on investments and securities                    
sold short by $1,542,563 and decrease paid-in surplus by $135.                  

At December 31, 2015, the Fund had undistributed ordinary income in             
the amount of $17,958 and no undistributed short term capital gains             
or undistributed long term capital gains for federal income tax                 
purposes.                                                                       

At December 31, 2015, the cost and related gross unrealized                     
appreciation and depreciation for federal income tax purposes                   
are as follows:

8. DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                

On July 22, 2015, the Fund's directors declared a dividend                      
payable December 1, 2015 to shareholders of record on                           
November 18, 2015. The December 1, 2015 dividend payment was                    
$0.52 per share.                                                                

The character of distributions paid during the years ended                      
December 31, 2015 and 2014 for federal income tax purposes                      
were as follows.

9.   INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS                                                    

For the year ended December 31, 2015,  the cost of purchases                    
and proceeds from sales of investments were $62,714,775 and                     
$80,328,740, respectively. There were no purchases or sales                     
of long-term U.S. government securities.                                        

10.   OFF-BALANCE-SHEET AND CONCENTRATION OF RISKS                              

The Fund may engage in the short sale of securities. Securities sold            
short represent obligations of the Fund that result in off-balance-             
sheet risk as the ultimate obligation may exceed the amount shown               
in the accompanying financial statements due to increases in the                
market values of these securities. These short positions are                    
generally hedged positions against portfolio holdings and, as a                 
result, any increase in the Fund's obligation related to these                  
short positions will generally be offset by gains in the related                
long positions. There were no securities sold short as of                       
December 31, 2015.                                                              

At December 31, 2015, the Fund's investments by industry                        
concentrations (as a percentage of net assets) were as follows:                 

Healthcare Equipment & Supplies 10.4%

Since the Fund does not clear its own investment transactions,                  
it has established an account with a third-party custodian (UMB                 
Bank, N.A.) for this purpose. In addition, the Fund has established             
an account with a brokerage firm (Citigroup) for the purpose of                 
purchasing securities on margin. At December 31, 2015, the Fund                 
did not have a margin account balance for securities purchased                  
on margin. The Fund pledges sufficient securities as                            
collateral for the margin account, if any, held by the custodian.               
As the valuation of such securities fluctuates, the Fund may be                 
required to pledge additional securities as collateral. The Fund                
pays interest on any margin balance, which is calculated                        
as the daily margin account balance times the broker's margin                   
interest rate. Interest is charged on payable balances at a rate equal          
to the Federal Funds rate (0.20% at December 31, 2015) plus 300                 
basis points. For the year ended December 31, 2015, margin                      
interest expense was $173,924 as shown on the statement of operations.          
For the year ended December 31, 2015, the average margin balance                
and interest rate were $3,201,784 and 3.49%, respectively.

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events, management has        
evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund through the           
date the financial statements were issued.                                      

Management has determined that there are no material events that would          
require disclosure in the Fund's financial statements.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES (UNAUDITED)                                               

A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund uses                 
to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio                          
securities is available (i) without charge, upon request,

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (UNAUDITED)                                          

Distributions from the Fund are recorded on the ex-distribution                 
date. Pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan                         
("DRIP"), all ordinary and capital gain distributions are                       
reinvested in Shares at the then prevailing net asset value.                    
Each Shareholder is automatically included in the DRIP unless                   
the Fund receives a written request from the Shareholder to receive             
such distributions in cash, or cash and stock. In order                         
to determine the number of shares to be received by each                        
Shareholder that participates in the DRIP, the aggregate ordinary               
and capital gain distribution allocated to the Shareholder that                 
is to be reinvested is divided by the Fund's Net Asset Value                    
per share immediately after giving effect to the aggregate amount               
of the dividend distribution declared by the Fund. For federal                  
income tax purposes, dividends paid by the Fund are taxable                     
whether received in cash or reinvested in additional Shares                     
pursuant to the DRIP. There are no fees, commissions or                         
expenses associated with the participation in the DRIP and                      
Shareholders may elect to terminate their participation in the                  
DRIP by written request to the Fund. Additional information regarding           
the Dividend Reinvestment Plan may be obtained by contacting                    
the Investment Advisor at 847.239.7100.

FUND EXPENSES (UNAUDITED)                                                       

A shareholder of the Fund incurs two types of costs: (1) transaction            
costs, such as redemption fees which may apply to shares held for               
less than one year, and (2) ongoing costs, including investment                 
advisory fees, transfer agent fees, and other Fund expenses. The                
examples below are intended to help shareholders understand the                 
ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare              
these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other funds.                 

Actual Expenses                                                                 

The following table provides information about actual account values            
and actual fund expenses for shareholders. The table shows the                  
expenses that a shareholder would have paid on a $1,000 investment              
in the Fund from July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 as well as how               
much a $1,000 investment would be worth at the close of the period,             
assuming actual fund returns and expenses. A shareholder can estimate           
expenses incurred for the period by dividing the account value at               
December 31, 2015 by $1,000 and multiplying the results by the number           
in the Expenses Paid During the Period row as shown below.                      

Beginning Account Value                     $1,000.00                           
Ending Account Value                        $  836.12

Annualized Expense Ratio                         2.35%                          

Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes                                    

The following table provides information about a hypothetical                   
account value and hypothetical expenses for the period July 1, 2015             
to December 31, 2015 based upon the Fund's actual expense ratio and             
an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is              
not the Fund's actual return.  The hypothetical account value and               
expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account                  
balance or expenses shareholders paid for the period.  Shareholders             
may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing              
in the Fund and other funds.  To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical            
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the                    
shareholder reports of the other funds.                                         

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to                   
highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction            
costs, such as redemption fees.  Therefore, the third line of the               
table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help              
you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds.               
In addition, if these transaction costs were included, your costs               
would have been higher.                                                         

Beginning Account Value                     $1,000.00

*     Expenses are equal to the Fund's annualized expense ratio,                
multiplied by the average account value over the period,            
multiplied by 184 (the number of days in the most recent fiscal     
half-year) divided by 365 (to reflect the one-half year             
period). For this purpose, margin interest is treated as an         
expense as opposed to a cost of capital.                            

ZAZOVE CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES FUND, INC.                                        
INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT APPROVAL (Unaudited)                              

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's             
investment advisory agreement require that the investment advisory              
agreement between the Fund and its investment adviser be approved               
annually both by a majority of the Board and by a majority of the               
independent Directors.                                                          

On December 9, 2015, the Board of Directors, including the                      
independent Directors (referred to collectively as the "Directors")             
unanimously determined that the terms of the investment advisory                
agreement are fair and reasonable and approved the continuance of               
the investment advisory contract as being in the best interests of              
the Fund and its shareholders.  In approving the investment                     
advisory agreement, the Directors reviewed the statutory and                    
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment               
advisory agreements.                                                            

The Directors evaluated, among other things, the items set forth                
below, and, after considering all factors together, determined, in              
the exercise of its business judgment, that approval of the investment          
advisory agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its                
shareholders.  The following summary provides more detail on certain            
matters considered by the Directors.                                            

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided.                            
The Directors considered the roles and responsibilities of the                  
Investment Advisor.  The Directors discussed with the Investment                
Advisor the systems and resources utilized in managing the Fund                 
and providing additional services including, accounting, legal,                 
administrative, marketing and client service.  The Directors                    
determined that the nature, extent and quality of the services                  
provided by the Investment Advisor support its decision to approve              
the investment advisory contract.                                               

Performance, fees and expenses of the Fund.                                     
The Directors compared the Fund's performance to its peers in the               
open-end convertible fund universe.  In addition, on a regular basis,           
the Directors review the Fund's performance verses appropriate market           
indices.  When considering the Fund's performance, the Directors                
discussed with the Investment Advisor the performance goals and the             
actual results achieved in managing the Fund with an emphasis placed            
on long-term returns. The Directors discussed with the Investment               
Advisor the level of advisory fees for the Fund relative to                     
other products advised by the adviser and the level of Fund expenses,           
including advisory fees, relative to comparable funds in the marketplace.       
The Directors reviewed not only the advisory fees but also other fees           
and expenses incurred by the Fund and the Fund's overall expense ratio.         
The Directors determined that the performance, fees and expenses of             
the Fund support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.      

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Pofitability.        
The Directors discussed the substantial resources that the Investment           
Advisor utilizes in performing its services for the Fund as well as the         
profitability of the Fund as compared to other products managed by              
the Investment Advisor. The Directors determined that the analysis of the       
investment adviser's expenses and profitability support its decision to         
approve the investment advisory contract.                                       

Economies of Scale.                                                             
The Directors considered the size of the Fund, the breakpoints                  
in the management fee structure and how it relates to the Fund's                
expense ratio.  The Directors determined that its review of the                 
actual and potential economies of scale of the Fund support its                 
decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

(1) Zazove Associates, LLC is engaged as the Fund's Investment Advisor          
pursuant to the terms of an Investment Advisory Agreement.  The                 
Investment Advisor is registered with the Securities and Exchange               
Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.               
Gene T. Pretti serves as President of the Fund and has served as                
the Investment Advisor's Chief Executive Officer and Senior                     
Portfolio Manager since October 1989.  Mr. Pretti is responsible                
for the day-to-day management of the Fund and is also primarily                 
responsible for managing certain other investment portfolios                    
managed by the Investment Advisor.                                              

(2) The following chart provides certain information with regard                
to the other accounts over which Mr. Pretti is primarily responsible            
for the day-to-day management:

The Investment Advisor engages in the practice of placing aggregate             
orders for the purchase or sale of securities on behalf of its                  
clients, which could include the Fund.  It is often the case that               
larger principal transactions can be executed at more favorable                 
prices than multiple smaller orders.  In addition, larger broker                
transactions may often be executed at lower commission costs on a               
per-dollar basis than multiple small orders. In all cases in which              
an aggregate order to purchase or sell securities is placed by the              
Investment Advisor, each account that participates in the aggregated            
order will participate at the average price and all transactions                
costs will be shared pro rata.  The Investment Advisor will act in              
good faith in the allocation of an aggregated order among accounts              
(including the Fund) such that no account is favored over any                   
other account.  The Investment Advisor may have financial or other              
incentives to favor certain other accounts over the Fund (e.g.,                 
another account pays higher fees), but the Investment Advisor                   
intends to treat all accounts (including the Fund) in a fair,                   
reasonable and equitable manner.                                                

(3) Portfolio Manager Compensation                                              
Mr. Pretti receives a fixed salary that is not dependent on the                 
performance of the Fund or any other accounts that he is primarily              
responsible for managing.  As the Investment Advisor's majority                 
equity holder, Mr. Pretti receives a distributive share of the                  
Investment Advisors net income.                                                 

(4) Portfolio Manager Beneficial Ownership in the Fund                          
The dollar range of Mr. Pretti's beneficial interest of equity                  
securities in the Fund is $500,000 - $1,000,000.                                

(b)  Not applicable.

*  On a quarterly basis, it is a basic policy of the Fund                       
to offer to repurchase no less than 5% and no more than                         
25% of the Fund's outstanding shares at the then net asset                      
value per share.  Notice of the terms and conditions of each                    
quarterly repurchase offer are sent to the shareholders in                      
advance of the offer.  The Fund may impose a 2% fee on the                      
redemption of fund shares held for less than one year.                          
This fee is intended to compensate the Fund for expenses                        
related to such redemption.  Shares are redeemed by treating                    
the shares first acquired by a shareholder as being redeemed                    
prior to shares acquired by such shareholders thereafter.                       
There were no redemption fees imposed during 2014.  It is a                     
basic policy of the Fund to offer on a quarterly basis to                       
repurchase no less than 5% and no more than 25% of the Fund's                   
outstanding shares at the then net asset value per share.                       
A Shareholder who desires to have Shares redeemed at the                        
close of a calendar quarter must submit a written request                       
by the 17th day of March, June, September or December,                          
as applicable (or the next business day if such day is                          
not a business day).  Each such day is referred to as a                         
"Repurchase Request Deadline." The Fund will send a notice                      
to each Shareholder no less than twenty-one and no more than                    
forty-two days before each Repurchase Request Deadline with                     
the details regarding the repurchase offer.  If the number                      
of Shares requested by the Shareholders for repurchase                          
exceeds the number of Shares in the repurchase offer, then                      
the Fund may repurchase an additional two percent of the                        
outstanding Shares.  If there is still an excess, the Fund                      
will repurchase Shares on a pro rata basis.  The Fund has                       
adopted written procedures reasonably designed to ensure                        
that the Fund's portfolio is sufficiently liquid to enable                      
the Fund to fulfill the repurchase requests.  The Fund has                      
the right, under certain circumstances, to force the                            
redemption of all or a portion of the Shares held by a                          
Shareholder.  The Fund may impose a 2% fee on the repurchase                    
of Shares held for less than one year, which fee is intended                    
to compensate the Fund for expenses related to such redemption.                 
Shares are deemed repurchased by treating the Shares first                      
acquired by a Shareholder as being repurchased prior to Shares                  
acquired by such Shareholder thereafter.                                        

Item 10:  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.                  
No material change.                                                             

Item 11: Controls and Procedures

financial officer have evaluated Registrant's disclosure                        
controls and Procedures within 90 days of this filing and                       
have concluded that Registrant's disclosure controls and                        
procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-2(c)) were effective                         
as of that date, in ensuring that the information required                      
to be disclosed by Registrant in this Form N-CSR was recorded,                  
processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.                           
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal                          
financial officer concluded that such procedures did not have                   
any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that                        
require corrective action.                                                      

b)  There were no changes in Registrant's internal control                      
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under                     
the Investment Company Act of 1940) that occurred during                        
Registrant's last fiscal half-year (Registrant's second                         
fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has                      
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially                      
affect, Registrant's internal control over financial                            
reporting.
