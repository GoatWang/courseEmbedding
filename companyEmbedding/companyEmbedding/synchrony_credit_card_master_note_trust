What You Should Know Before You Apply for a Synchrony Bank Credit CardUpdated: July 19, 2017By Steven AbramsMentioned In This Article
Citi Simplicity® Card - No Late Fees Ever
Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express
Discover it® - 18 Month Balance Transfer Offer
Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card
Capital One® Quicksilver® Cash Rewards Credit CardThere are many benefits to banking at your local bank or credit union. You can receive personalized care and customer service, as well as talk to people who are from your own community and are away of your area’s unique needs. That level of personal attention is great when it comes to home loans and refinances, but when it comes to credit cards, you may what to shop the national brands before choosing your local bank card.The credit card market is highly competitive, and national brands like American Express, Citi, Chase, and Capital One are always adding new incentives to increase their market share. With that level of competition from the big banks, it can be hard for regional banks like Commerce Bank or Synchrony Bank to keep up. Before you sign up for a credit card from Suncoast or PNC, make sure you compare these benefits to cards from major banks:0% Intro APR Period – Many credit cards offer a 0% introductory APR period on balance transfers or purchases, allowing new customers to see significant savings by not paying interest for a period of months.Rewards Categories – Credit cards that offer rewards, like cash back or miles, will often allow cardholders to earn extra rewards per dollar when they use their cards in specific categories, like restaurants or travel.Signup Bonus – Many credit cards include signup bonuses to new customers. This can be in the form of cash back, a statement credit, miles, or points.Everyday Spending – Some credit cards offer a well rounded set of rewards, bonuses, and benefits for card holder's everyday spending needs.Flat-Rate Rewards – Credit card rewards can be complicated and require opting into new rotating bonus categories. Flat-rate reward cards simplify the process by earning you the same reward on all your spending.Limited Time Offers – The national credit card issuers often add special deals that are only available for a limited time to new customers. The offers are generally very significant, from deep discounts at major retailers to considerable bonus rewards.Comparing the rewards and benefits between credit cards can help you find a card that matches your spending habits. If you’re looking for a new credit card, you can start by comparing what these cards from national issuers offer:0% Intro APR Period: Citi Simplicity® Card

LEARN MOREAn easy way to see increased savings is move your balance from a high interest rate credit card to a card with a balance transfer offer. 0% intro APR offers also give consumers time to pay down their debt or make a plan to pay off a big ticket purchase. The Citi Simplicity® Card from Citi, an Offers.com advertiser, with its industry leading 21-month introductory APR on balance transfer and purchases, is a card to consider when shopping for a new card.After the intro period, the APR will be a variable 14.49% - 24.49% based on your credit worthiness. If you transfer only a $3,000 and you budget correctly over the 21 months, you can see hundreds of dollars in savings against paying interest every month. That includes the 3% balance transfer fee. The card also has no late fees, no penalty rate, and no annual fee.Everyday Spending: Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express

APPLY NOWThe Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express, an Offers.com advertiser, has a full set of rewards and benefits that make it a card to consider. You can earn a $100 statement credit if you spend $1,000 in purchases in the first three months of having the new card.You also get extra cash back on every day spending. You earn 3% back at U.S. supermarkets, up to $6,000 per year (then it drops to 1%). You also earn 2% back at U.S. gas stations and at select U.S. department stores, and 1% back on other purchases.As this is an American Express card, the card includes extensive consumer coverage, like travel insurance, extended warranty, and purchase and return protection.Rewards Categories: Discover it® - 18 Month Balance Transfer Offer

APPLY NOWWhile other cards may only offer a rigid set of spending categories, the Discover it® - 18 Month Balance Transfer Offer card allows cardholders multiples ways to earn bonus cash back. The card’s categories change every quarter, but generally are always on things you purchase every day. Through the end of September, you can earn 5% cash back at restaurants. While the 5% is capped each quarter at $1500, you earn unlimited 1% back on all other purchases. Other 5% categories in the past have been at Amazon.com, gas stations, movies, and home improvement. The card also has an impressive introductory balance transfer offer.The Discover it® - 18 Month Balance Transfer Offer card also offers new cardholders another way to increase their savings. With Cashback Match™, Discover will automatically match your cash back rewards at the end of your first year, turning $300 into $600. You can redeem your cash back at any time for any amount, and there is no annual fee.Signup Bonus: Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card

APPLY NOWThe signup bonus offered with the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card offers is one of the more valuable and flexible in the industry. New cardmembers can earn 50,000 bonus points if they spend $4,000 in the first three months from account opening. The bonus can be redeemed for $625 in travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards, or as a $500 statement credit.Unlike with frequent flyer programs, rewards have no blackout dates or travel restrictions if you use them through Chase. Chase reward points can also be transferred at a 1:1 ratio to some of the leading frequent flyer and hotel rewards programs if you have a favorite carrier or are close to earning a free flight.You can earn 2x points when you travel and at restaurants, and 1x points on all other spending. Primarily a travel card, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card has many travel benefits, including no foreign transaction fees and trip cancelation and baggage delay insurance, as well as trip delay reimbursement. There is a $95 annual fee that is waived the first year.Flat-Rate Rewards: Capital One® Quicksilver® Cash Rewards Credit Card

LEARN MOREThe Capital One® Quicksilver® Cash Rewards Credit Card combines a significant cash back earning potential with strong consumer protections. Rather than keep track of which categories you earn bonus rewards, the Quicksilver® Cash Rewards card earns unlimited 1.5% cash back on every purchase you make. New cardholders can earn a $150 cash bonus after spending $500 in the first three months from account approval. There is no annual fee and no foreign transaction fees with this card, which makes the earning potential even more impressive.The card offers consumer protection coverage like travel protection and complimentary concierge service. The card also has extended warranty coverage as well as price protection, where if you find a lower price on an item you purchased within 120 days of your purchase, you may receive the difference back.

Fitch to Rate Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust Series 2016-2; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust Series 2016-2; 
      Presale Issued
    





May 20, 2016 11:06 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to Synchrony 
      Credit Card Master Note Trust's asset-backed notes series 2016-2:
    

      --$500,000,000 class A fixed-rate 'AAAsf(EXP)'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,945,205 class B fixed-rate 'AAsf(EXP)'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$41,095,891 class C fixed-rate 'Asf(EXP)'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$61,643,835 class D fixed-rate 'NR(EXP)'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch's expected ratings are based on the underlying receivables pool, 
      available credit enhancement, Synchrony Bank's underwriting, Synchrony 
      Financial's servicing, and the transaction's legal and cash flow 
      structures, which employ early redemption triggers.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating 
      sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card 
      asset-backed securities transactions: 1) increased defaults; 2) a 
      reduction in purchase rate; and 3) a combination stress of higher 
      defaults and lower monthly payment rate (MPR).
    

      Increasing defaults and reducing purchase rate alone have the least 
      impact on rating migration even in the most severe scenario of a 75% 
      increase in defaults. The harshest scenario assumes both stresses in 
      increased chargeoffs and reduction to MPR to occur simultaneously. 
      Similarly, the ratings would only be downgraded under the moderate 
      stress of a 50% increase in defaults and 25% reduction in MPR; however, 
      the severe stress could lead to more drastic downgrades to all classes.
    

      To date, the transactions have exhibited strong performance with all 
      performance metrics within Fitch's initial expectations. For further 
      discussion of our sensitivity analysis, please see the related presale 
      report. For a discussion of the representations, warranties, and 
      enforcement mechanisms available to investors in this transaction please 
      see the related presale appendix.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      For more information about Fitch's comprehensive subscription service

What You Should Know Before You Apply for a Synchrony Bank Credit CardUpdated: July 19, 2017By Steven AbramsMentioned In This Article
Citi Simplicity® Card - No Late Fees Ever
Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express
Discover it® - 18 Month Balance Transfer Offer
Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card
Capital One® Quicksilver® Cash Rewards Credit CardThere are many benefits to banking at your local bank or credit union. You can receive personalized care and customer service, as well as talk to people who are from your own community and are away of your area’s unique needs. That level of personal attention is great when it comes to home loans and refinances, but when it comes to credit cards, you may what to shop the national brands before choosing your local bank card.The credit card market is highly competitive, and national brands like American Express, Citi, Chase, and Capital One are always adding new incentives to increase their market share. With that level of competition from the big banks, it can be hard for regional banks like Commerce Bank or Synchrony Bank to keep up. Before you sign up for a credit card from Suncoast or PNC, make sure you compare these benefits to cards from major banks:0% Intro APR Period – Many credit cards offer a 0% introductory APR period on balance transfers or purchases, allowing new customers to see significant savings by not paying interest for a period of months.Rewards Categories – Credit cards that offer rewards, like cash back or miles, will often allow cardholders to earn extra rewards per dollar when they use their cards in specific categories, like restaurants or travel.Signup Bonus – Many credit cards include signup bonuses to new customers. This can be in the form of cash back, a statement credit, miles, or points.Everyday Spending – Some credit cards offer a well rounded set of rewards, bonuses, and benefits for card holder's everyday spending needs.Flat-Rate Rewards – Credit card rewards can be complicated and require opting into new rotating bonus categories. Flat-rate reward cards simplify the process by earning you the same reward on all your spending.Limited Time Offers – The national credit card issuers often add special deals that are only available for a limited time to new customers. The offers are generally very significant, from deep discounts at major retailers to considerable bonus rewards.Comparing the rewards and benefits between credit cards can help you find a card that matches your spending habits. If you’re looking for a new credit card, you can start by comparing what these cards from national issuers offer:0% Intro APR Period: Citi Simplicity® Card

LEARN MOREAn easy way to see increased savings is move your balance from a high interest rate credit card to a card with a balance transfer offer. 0% intro APR offers also give consumers time to pay down their debt or make a plan to pay off a big ticket purchase. The Citi Simplicity® Card from Citi, an Offers.com advertiser, with its industry leading 21-month introductory APR on balance transfer and purchases, is a card to consider when shopping for a new card.After the intro period, the APR will be a variable 14.49% - 24.49% based on your credit worthiness. If you transfer only a $3,000 and you budget correctly over the 21 months, you can see hundreds of dollars in savings against paying interest every month. That includes the 3% balance transfer fee. The card also has no late fees, no penalty rate, and no annual fee.Everyday Spending: Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express

APPLY NOWThe Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express, an Offers.com advertiser, has a full set of rewards and benefits that make it a card to consider. You can earn a $100 statement credit if you spend $1,000 in purchases in the first three months of having the new card.You also get extra cash back on every day spending. You earn 3% back at U.S. supermarkets, up to $6,000 per year (then it drops to 1%). You also earn 2% back at U.S. gas stations and at select U.S. department stores, and 1% back on other purchases.As this is an American Express card, the card includes extensive consumer coverage, like travel insurance, extended warranty, and purchase and return protection.Rewards Categories: Discover it® - 18 Month Balance Transfer Offer

APPLY NOWWhile other cards may only offer a rigid set of spending categories, the Discover it® - 18 Month Balance Transfer Offer card allows cardholders multiples ways to earn bonus cash back. The card’s categories change every quarter, but generally are always on things you purchase every day. Through the end of September, you can earn 5% cash back at restaurants. While the 5% is capped each quarter at $1500, you earn unlimited 1% back on all other purchases. Other 5% categories in the past have been at Amazon.com, gas stations, movies, and home improvement. The card also has an impressive introductory balance transfer offer.The Discover it® - 18 Month Balance Transfer Offer card also offers new cardholders another way to increase their savings. With Cashback Match™, Discover will automatically match your cash back rewards at the end of your first year, turning $300 into $600. You can redeem your cash back at any time for any amount, and there is no annual fee.Signup Bonus: Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card
