Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about the historical movement during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century that became part of the broader Restoration Movement. For information relating to the modern denomination called the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) which grew out of the Restoration Movement, see Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
The Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement) were a group arising during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. The most prominent leaders were Thomas and Alexander Campbell. The group was committed to restoring primitive Christianity. It merged with the Christians (Stone Movement) in 1832 to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement).

History[edit]

Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington







Thomas Campbell


The Campbell wing of the American Restoration Movement was launched when Thomas Campbell published the Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington in 1809. The Presbyterian Synod had suspended his ministerial credentials. In The Declaration and Address he set forth some of his convictions about the church of Jesus Christ, as he organized the Christian Association of Washington, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, not as a church but as an association of persons seeking to grow in faith.[1]:108–111 On May 4, 1811, the Christian Association constituted itself as a congregationally governed church. With the building it constructed at Brush Run, Pennsylvania, it became known as Brush Run Church.[1]:117 When their study of the New Testament led the reformers to begin to practice baptism by immersion, the nearby Redstone Baptist Association invited Brush Run Church to join with them for the purpose of fellowship. The reformers agreed, provided that they would be "allowed to preach and to teach whatever they learned from the Scriptures."[2]:86




Alexander Campbell


Thomas' son Alexander immigrated to the US to join him in 1809, and before long assumed the leading role in the movement.[3]:106
The Campbells worked within the Redstone Baptist Association during the period 1815 through 1824. While both the Campbells and the Baptists shared practices of baptism by immersion and congregational polity, it was soon clear that he and his associates were not traditional Baptists. Within the Redstone Association, some of the Baptist leaders considered the differences intolerable when Alexander Campbell began publishing a journal, The Christian Baptist, which promoted reform. Campbell anticipated the conflict and moved his membership to a congregation of the Mahoning Baptist Association in 1824.[1]:131
Alexander used The Christian Baptist to address what he saw as the key issue of reconstructing the apostolic Christian community in a systematic and rational manner.[3]:106 He wanted to clearly distinguish between essential and non-essential aspects of primitive Christianity.[3]:106 Among what he identified as essential were "congregational autonomy, a plurality of elders in each congregation, weekly communion and immersion for the remission of sins."[3]:106 Among practices he rejected as non-essential were "the holy kiss, deaconesses, communal living, footwashing and charismatic exercises."[3]:106




Walter Scott


In 1827, the Mahoning Association appointed Walter Scott as an evangelist. Through Scott's efforts, the Mahoning Association grew rapidly. In 1828, Thomas Campbell visited several of the congregations formed by Scott and heard him preach. Campbell believed that Scott was bringing an important new dimension to the movement with his approach to evangelism.[1]:132–133
Several Baptist associations began disassociating congregations that refused to subscribe to the Philadelphia Confession.[4] The Mahoning Association came under attack. In 1830, The Mahoning Baptist Association disbanded. The younger Campbell ceased publication of the Christian Baptist. In January 1831, he began publication of the Millennial Harbinger.[1]:144–145
Influence of the Enlightenment[edit]




John Locke by Herman Verelst.


The Age of Enlightenment had a significant influence on the Campbell movement.[3]:80–86 Thomas Campbell was a student of the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke.[3]:82 While he did not explicitly use the term "essentials," in the Declaration and Address, Campbell proposed the same solution to religious division as had been advanced earlier by Herbert and Locke: "[R]educe religion to a set of essentials upon which all reasonable persons might agree."[3]:80 The essentials he identified were those practices for which the Bible provided "a 'Thus saith the Lord,' either in express terms or by approved precedent."[3]:81 Unlike Locke, who saw the earlier efforts by Puritans as inherently divisive, Campbell argued for "a complete restoration of apostolic Christianity."[3]:82 Thomas believed that creeds served to divide Christians. He also believed that the Bible was clear enough that anyone could understand it and, thus, creeds were unnecessary.[5]:114
Alexander Campbell was also deeply influenced by Enlightenment thinking, in particular the Scottish School of Common Sense of Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart.[3]:84 This group saw the Bible as providing concrete facts rather than abstract truths, and advocated a scientific or Baconian approach to interpreting the Bible that would begin with those facts, arrange the ones applicable to a given topic, and then use them to draw conclusions.[3]:84 Alexander Campbell reflected this approach, when arguing that "the Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, nor of verbal definitions."[3]:84 He believed that if Christians would limit themselves to the facts found in the Bible, they would necessarily come to agreement. He saw those facts as providing a blueprint or constitution for the church.[3]:84,85
Characteristics of the movement[edit]
Thomas Campbell combined the Enlightenment approach to unity with the Reformed and Puritan traditions of restoration.[3]:82,106 The Enlightenment affected the Campbell movement in two ways. First, it provided the idea that Christian unity could be achieved by finding a set of essentials that all reasonable people could agree on. The second was the concept of a rational faith that was formulated and defended on the basis of a set of facts derived from the Bible.[3]:85,86
Alexander Campbell's millennialism was more optimistic than Stone's.[6]:6 He had more confidence in the potential for human progress and believed that Christians could unite to transform the world and initiate a millennial age.[6]:6 Campbell's conceptions were postmillennial, as he anticipated that the progress of the church and society would lead to an age of peace and righteousness before the return of Christ.[6]:6 This optimistic approach meant that, in addition to his commitment to primitivism, he had a progressive strand in his thinking.[6]:7
Those following the Campbells were called "Reforming Baptists" because of the associations with the Baptist at the beginning of the movement; this was sometimes shortened to "Reformers."[7]:85 "Disciples" was the name Alexander Campbell preferred.[7]:86 Opponents of the movement nicknamed them "Campbellites."[7]:85–86
Merger with the Christians (Stone Movement)[edit]
See also: Christians (Stone Movement)




"Raccoon" John Smith


The Campbell movement was characterized by a "systematic and rational reconstruction" of the early church, in contrast to the Stone movement which was characterized by radical freedom and lack of dogma.[3]:106–108 Despite their differences, the two movements agreed on several critical issues.[3]:108 Both saw restoring apostolic Christianity as a means of hastening the millennium.[3]:108 Both also saw restoring the early church as a route to Christian freedom.[3]:108 And, both believed that unity among Christians could be achieved by using apostolic Christianity as a model.[3]:108 The commitment of both movements to restoring the early church and to uniting Christians was enough to motivate a union between many in the two movements.[6]:8,9
The Stone and Campbell movements merged in 1832.[2]:116–120[7]:28[8]:212[9]:xxi[10]:xxxvii This was formalized at the High Street Meeting House in Lexington, Kentucky with a handshake between Barton W. Stone and "Raccoon" John Smith.[2]:116–120 Smith had been chosen, by those present, to speak in behalf of the followers of the Campbells.[2]:116 A preliminary meeting of the two groups was held in late December 1831, culminating with the merger on January 1, 1832.[2]:116–120[10]:xxxvii
Two representatives of those assembled were appointed to carry the news of the union to all the churches: John Rogers, for the Christians and "Raccoon" John Smith for the reformers. Despite some challenges, the merger succeeded.[1]:153–154 Many believed the union held great promise for the future success of the combined movement, and greeted the news enthusiastically.[6]:9
With the merger, there was the challenge of what to call the new movement. Clearly, finding a Biblical, non-sectarian name was important. Stone wanted to continue to use the name "Christians." Alexander Campbell insisted upon "Disciples of Christ". As a result, both names were used.[1]:27–28[11]:125 The confusion over names has been present ever since.[1]:27–28

Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about the historical movement during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century that became part of the broader Restoration Movement. For information relating to the modern denomination called the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) which grew out of the Restoration Movement, see Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
The Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement) were a group arising during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. The most prominent leaders were Thomas and Alexander Campbell. The group was committed to restoring primitive Christianity. It merged with the Christians (Stone Movement) in 1832 to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement).

Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington







Thomas Campbell


The Campbell wing of the American Restoration Movement was launched when Thomas Campbell published the Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington in 1809. The Presbyterian Synod had suspended his ministerial credentials. In The Declaration and Address he set forth some of his convictions about the church of Jesus Christ, as he organized the Christian Association of Washington, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, not as a church but as an association of persons seeking to grow in faith.[1]:108–111 On May 4, 1811, the Christian Association constituted itself as a congregationally governed church. With the building it constructed at Brush Run, Pennsylvania, it became known as Brush Run Church.[1]:117 When their study of the New Testament led the reformers to begin to practice baptism by immersion, the nearby Redstone Baptist Association invited Brush Run Church to join with them for the purpose of fellowship. The reformers agreed, provided that they would be "allowed to preach and to teach whatever they learned from the Scriptures."[2]:86




Alexander Campbell


Thomas' son Alexander immigrated to the US to join him in 1809, and before long assumed the leading role in the movement.[3]:106
The Campbells worked within the Redstone Baptist Association during the period 1815 through 1824. While both the Campbells and the Baptists shared practices of baptism by immersion and congregational polity, it was soon clear that he and his associates were not traditional Baptists. Within the Redstone Association, some of the Baptist leaders considered the differences intolerable when Alexander Campbell began publishing a journal, The Christian Baptist, which promoted reform.

Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about the historical movement during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century that became part of the broader Restoration Movement. For information relating to the modern denomination called the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) which grew out of the Restoration Movement, see Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
The Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement) were a group arising during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. The most prominent leaders were Thomas and Alexander Campbell. The group was committed to restoring primitive Christianity. It merged with the Christians (Stone Movement) in 1832 to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement).

Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington







Thomas Campbell


The Campbell wing of the American Restoration Movement was launched when Thomas Campbell published the Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington in 1809. The Presbyterian Synod had suspended his ministerial credentials. In The Declaration and Address he set forth some of his convictions about the church of Jesus Christ, as he organized the Christian Association of Washington, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, not as a church but as an association of persons seeking to grow in faith.[1]:108–111 On May 4, 1811, the Christian Association constituted itself as a congregationally governed church. With the building it constructed at Brush Run, Pennsylvania, it became known as Brush Run Church.[1]:117 When their study of the New Testament led the reformers to begin to practice baptism by immersion, the nearby Redstone Baptist Association invited Brush Run Church to join with them for the purpose of fellowship. The reformers agreed, provided that they would be "allowed to preach and to teach whatever they learned from the Scriptures."[2]:86




Alexander Campbell


Thomas' son Alexander immigrated to the US to join him in 1809, and before long assumed the leading role in the movement.[3]:106
The Campbells worked within the Redstone Baptist Association during the period 1815 through 1824. While both the Campbells and the Baptists shared practices of baptism by immersion and congregational polity, it was soon clear that he and his associates were not traditional Baptists. Within the Redstone Association, some of the Baptist leaders considered the differences intolerable when Alexander Campbell began publishing a journal, The Christian Baptist, which promoted reform. Campbell anticipated the conflict and moved his membership to a congregation of the Mahoning Baptist Association in 1824.[1]:131
Alexander used The Christian Baptist to address what he saw as the key issue of reconstructing the apostolic Christian community in a systematic and rational manner.[3]:106 He wanted to clearly distinguish between essential and non-essential aspects of primitive Christianity.[3]:106 Among what he identified as essential were "congregational autonomy, a plurality of elders in each congregation, weekly communion and immersion for the remission of sins."[3]:106 Among practices he rejected as non-essential were "the holy kiss, deaconesses, communal living, footwashing and charismatic exercises."[3]:106




Walter Scott


In 1827, the Mahoning Association appointed Walter Scott as an evangelist. Through Scott's efforts, the Mahoning Association grew rapidly. In 1828, Thomas Campbell visited several of the congregations formed by Scott and heard him preach. Campbell believed that Scott was bringing an important new dimension to the movement with his approach to evangelism.[1]:132–133
Several Baptist associations began disassociating congregations that refused to subscribe to the Philadelphia Confession.[4] The Mahoning Association came under attack. In 1830, The Mahoning Baptist Association disbanded. The younger Campbell ceased publication of the Christian Baptist. In January 1831, he began publication of the Millennial Harbinger.[1]:144–145
Influence of the Enlightenment[edit]




John Locke by Herman Verelst.


The Age of Enlightenment had a significant influence on the Campbell movement.[3]:80–86 Thomas Campbell was a student of the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke.[3]:82 While he did not explicitly use the term "essentials," in the Declaration and Address, Campbell proposed the same solution to religious division as had been advanced earlier by Herbert and Locke: "[R]educe religion to a set of essentials upon which all reasonable persons might agree."[3]:80 The essentials he identified were those practices for which the Bible provided "a 'Thus saith the Lord,' either in express terms or by approved precedent."[3]:81 Unlike Locke, who saw the earlier efforts by Puritans as inherently divisive, Campbell argued for "a complete restoration of apostolic Christianity."[3]:82 Thomas believed that creeds served to divide Christians. He also believed that the Bible was clear enough that anyone could understand it and, thus, creeds were unnecessary.[5]:114
Alexander Campbell was also deeply influenced by Enlightenment thinking, in particular the Scottish School of Common Sense of Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart.[3]:84 This group saw the Bible as providing concrete facts rather than abstract truths, and advocated a scientific or Baconian approach to interpreting the Bible that would begin with those facts, arrange the ones applicable to a given topic, and then use them to draw conclusions.[3]:84 Alexander Campbell reflected this approach, when arguing that "the Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, nor of verbal definitions."[3]:84 He believed that if Christians would limit themselves to the facts found in the Bible, they would necessarily come to agreement. He saw those facts as providing a blueprint or constitution for the church.[3]:84,85
Characteristics of the movement[edit]
Thomas Campbell combined the Enlightenment approach to unity with the Reformed and Puritan traditions of restoration.[3]:82,106 The Enlightenment affected the Campbell movement in two ways. First, it provided the idea that Christian unity could be achieved by finding a set of essentials that all reasonable people could agree on. The second was the concept of a rational faith that was formulated and defended on the basis of a set of facts derived from the Bible.[3]:85,86
Alexander Campbell's millennialism was more optimistic than Stone's.[6]:6 He had more confidence in the potential for human progress and believed that Christians could unite to transform the world and initiate a millennial age.[6]:6 Campbell's conceptions were postmillennial, as he anticipated that the progress of the church and society would lead to an age of peace and righteousness before the return of Christ.[6]:6 This optimistic approach meant that, in addition to his commitment to primitivism, he had a progressive strand in his thinking.[6]:7
Those following the Campbells were called "Reforming Baptists" because of the associations with the Baptist at the beginning of the movement; this was sometimes shortened to "Reformers."[7]:85 "Disciples" was the name Alexander Campbell preferred.[7]:86 Opponents of the movement nicknamed them "Campbellites."[7]:85–86
Merger with the Christians (Stone Movement)[edit]
See also: Christians (Stone Movement)




"Raccoon" John Smith


The Campbell movement was characterized by a "systematic and rational reconstruction" of the early church, in contrast to the Stone movement which was characterized by radical freedom and lack of dogma.[3]:106–108 Despite their differences, the two movements agreed on several critical issues.[3]:108 Both saw restoring apostolic Christianity as a means of hastening the millennium.[3]:108 Both also saw restoring the early church as a route to Christian freedom.[3]:108 And, both believed that unity among Christians could be achieved by using apostolic Christianity as a model.[3]:108 The commitment of both movements to restoring the early church and to uniting Christians was enough to motivate a union between many in the two movements.[6]:8,9
The Stone and Campbell movements merged in 1832.[2]:116–120[7]:28[8]:212[9]:xxi[10]:xxxvii This was formalized at the High Street Meeting House in Lexington, Kentucky with a handshake between Barton W. Stone and "Raccoon" John Smith.[2]:116–120 Smith had been chosen, by those present, to speak in behalf of the followers of the Campbells.[2]:116 A preliminary meeting of the two groups was held in late December 1831, culminating with the merger on January 1, 1832.[2]:116–120[10]:xxxvii
Two representatives of those assembled were appointed to carry the news of the union to all the churches: John Rogers, for the Christians and "Raccoon" John Smith for the reformers. Despite some challenges, the merger succeeded.[1]:153–154 Many believed the union held great promise for the future success of the combined movement, and greeted the news enthusiastically.[6]:9
With the merger, there was the challenge of what to call the new movement. Clearly, finding a Biblical, non-sectarian name was important. Stone wanted to continue to use the name "Christians." Alexander Campbell insisted upon "Disciples of Christ". As a result, both names were used.[1]:27–28[11]:125 The confusion over names has been present ever since.[1]:27–28

Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about the historical movement during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century that became part of the broader Restoration Movement. For information relating to the modern denomination called the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) which grew out of the Restoration Movement, see Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
The Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement) were a group arising during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. The most prominent leaders were Thomas and Alexander Campbell. The group was committed to restoring primitive Christianity. It merged with the Christians (Stone Movement) in 1832 to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement).

History[edit]



Wikisource has original text related to this article:
Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington







Thomas Campbell


The Campbell wing of the American Restoration Movement was launched when Thomas Campbell published the Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington in 1809. The Presbyterian Synod had suspended his ministerial credentials. In The Declaration and Address he set forth some of his convictions about the church of Jesus Christ, as he organized the Christian Association of Washington, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, not as a church but as an association of persons seeking to grow in faith.[1]:108–111 On May 4, 1811, the Christian Association constituted itself as a congregationally governed church. With the building it constructed at Brush Run, Pennsylvania, it became known as Brush Run Church.[1]:117 When their study of the New Testament led the reformers to begin to practice baptism by immersion, the nearby Redstone Baptist Association invited Brush Run Church to join with them for the purpose of fellowship. The reformers agreed, provided that they would be "allowed to preach and to teach whatever they learned from the Scriptures."[2]:86




Alexander Campbell


Thomas' son Alexander immigrated to the US to join him in 1809, and before long assumed the leading role in the movement.[3]:106
The Campbells worked within the Redstone Baptist Association during the period 1815 through 1824. While both the Campbells and the Baptists shared practices of baptism by immersion and congregational polity, it was soon clear that he and his associates were not traditional Baptists. Within the Redstone Association, some of the Baptist leaders considered the differences intolerable when Alexander Campbell began publishing a journal, The Christian Baptist, which promoted reform. Campbell anticipated the conflict and moved his membership to a congregation of the Mahoning Baptist Association in 1824.[1]:131
Alexander used The Christian Baptist to address what he saw as the key issue of reconstructing the apostolic Christian community in a systematic and rational manner.[3]:106 He wanted to clearly distinguish between essential and non-essential aspects of primitive Christianity.[3]:106 Among what he identified as essential were "congregational autonomy, a plurality of elders in each congregation, weekly communion and immersion for the remission of sins."[3]:106 Among practices he rejected as non-essential were "the holy kiss, deaconesses, communal living, footwashing and charismatic exercises."[3]:106




Walter Scott


In 1827, the Mahoning Association appointed Walter Scott as an evangelist. Through Scott's efforts, the Mahoning Association grew rapidly. In 1828, Thomas Campbell visited several of the congregations formed by Scott and heard him preach. Campbell believed that Scott was bringing an important new dimension to the movement with his approach to evangelism.[1]:132–133
Several Baptist associations began disassociating congregations that refused to subscribe to the Philadelphia Confession.[4] The Mahoning Association came under attack. In 1830, The Mahoning Baptist Association disbanded. The younger Campbell ceased publication of the Christian Baptist. In January 1831, he began publication of the Millennial Harbinger.[1]:144–145
Influence of the Enlightenment[edit]




John Locke by Herman Verelst.


The Age of Enlightenment had a significant influence on the Campbell movement.[3]:80–86 Thomas Campbell was a student of the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke.[3]:82 While he did not explicitly use the term "essentials," in the Declaration and Address, Campbell proposed the same solution to religious division as had been advanced earlier by Herbert and Locke: "[R]educe religion to a set of essentials upon which all reasonable persons might agree."[3]:80 The essentials he identified were those practices for which the Bible provided "a 'Thus saith the Lord,' either in express terms or by approved precedent."[3]:81 Unlike Locke, who saw the earlier efforts by Puritans as inherently divisive, Campbell argued for "a complete restoration of apostolic Christianity."[3]:82 Thomas believed that creeds served to divide Christians. He also believed that the Bible was clear enough that anyone could understand it and, thus, creeds were unnecessary.[5]:114
Alexander Campbell was also deeply influenced by Enlightenment thinking, in particular the Scottish School of Common Sense of Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart.[3]:84 This group saw the Bible as providing concrete facts rather than abstract truths, and advocated a scientific or Baconian approach to interpreting the Bible that would begin with those facts, arrange the ones applicable to a given topic, and then use them to draw conclusions.[3]:84 Alexander Campbell reflected this approach, when arguing that "the Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, nor of verbal definitions."[3]:84 He believed that if Christians would limit themselves to the facts found in the Bible, they would necessarily come to agreement. He saw those facts as providing a blueprint or constitution for the church.[3]:84,85
Characteristics of the movement[edit]
Thomas Campbell combined the Enlightenment approach to unity with the Reformed and Puritan traditions of restoration.[3]:82,106 The Enlightenment affected the Campbell movement in two ways. First, it provided the idea that Christian unity could be achieved by finding a set of essentials that all reasonable people could agree on. The second was the concept of a rational faith that was formulated and defended on the basis of a set of facts derived from the Bible.[3]:85,86
Alexander Campbell's millennialism was more optimistic than Stone's.[6]:6 He had more confidence in the potential for human progress and believed that Christians could unite to transform the world and initiate a millennial age.[6]:6 Campbell's conceptions were postmillennial, as he anticipated that the progress of the church and society would lead to an age of peace and righteousness before the return of Christ.[6]:6 This optimistic approach meant that, in addition to his commitment to primitivism, he had a progressive strand in his thinking.[6]:7
Those following the Campbells were called "Reforming Baptists" because of the associations with the Baptist at the beginning of the movement; this was sometimes shortened to "Reformers."[7]:85 "Disciples" was the name Alexander Campbell preferred.[7]:86 Opponents of the movement nicknamed them "Campbellites."[7]:85–86
Merger with the Christians (Stone Movement)[edit]
See also: Christians (Stone Movement)




"Raccoon" John Smith


The Campbell movement was characterized by a "systematic and rational reconstruction" of the early church, in contrast to the Stone movement which was characterized by radical freedom and lack of dogma.[3]:106–108 Despite their differences, the two movements agreed on several critical issues.[3]:108 Both saw restoring apostolic Christianity as a means of hastening the millennium.[3]:108 Both also saw restoring the early church as a route to Christian freedom.[3]:108 And, both believed that unity among Christians could be achieved by using apostolic Christianity as a model.[3]:108 The commitment of both movements to restoring the early church and to uniting Christians was enough to motivate a union between many in the two movements.[6]:8,9
The Stone and Campbell movements merged in 1832.[2]:116–120[7]:28[8]:212[9]:xxi[10]:xxxvii This was formalized at the High Street Meeting House in Lexington, Kentucky with a handshake between Barton W. Stone and "Raccoon" John Smith.[2]:116–120 Smith had been chosen, by those present, to speak in behalf of the followers of the Campbells.[2]:116 A preliminary meeting of the two groups was held in late December 1831, culminating with the merger on January 1, 1832.[2]:116–120[10]:xxxvii
Two representatives of those assembled were appointed to carry the news of the union to all the churches: John Rogers, for the Christians and "Raccoon" John Smith for the reformers. Despite some challenges, the merger succeeded.[1]:153–154 Many believed the union held great promise for the future success of the combined movement, and greeted the news enthusiastically.[6]:9
With the merger, there was the challenge of what to call the new movement. Clearly, finding a Biblical, non-sectarian name was important. Stone wanted to continue to use the name "Christians." Alexander Campbell insisted upon "Disciples of Christ". As a result, both names were used.[1]:27–28[11]:125 The confusion over names has been present ever since.[1]:27–28

A Brief History of the Stone-Campbell Tradition



 
 


 


 


                    19th Century Revival meeting        


 


The Stone-Campbell tradition represents an indigenous American religious body, descended from the Calvinist Presbyterian Church and named for the men generally recognized as its founders and vital early leaders, Barton Warren Stone (1772-1844) and Alexander Campbell (1788-1866).









This group of believers first gathered on the Appalachian frontier in the early 1800s and was very much a product of its time and place. The theology of the movement appealed to the intense individualism of Jacksonian America by placing emphasis on the ability of laypersons to read and understand scriptures for themselves without intercession by priest or other clergy. An understanding of Stone-Campbell history is key to placing it in the context of the social and political forces of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in America, and, more importantly, in understanding the Disciples' contributions to the democratic and religious ethos of the nation.

Today, the tradition is largely represented by three religious groups: the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ, and the Churches of Christ.  Several other religious bodies trace their origins to one or more of these three churches - the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) is the oldest of the three churches. The Churches of Christ broke away from the Disciples in the late nineteenth century, and the Christian Church/Churches of Christ separated from the Disciples in the mid-twentieth century.

The objective in the formation and development of the Stone-Campbell churches was to restore Christian unity through abolishing creeds and returning to the principles of the early churches described in the New Testament.

The first group, led by Stone, began in 1801 during the great revival at the Cane Ridge Meeting House near Paris, Kentucky. These congregants called themselves "Christians," reflecting their simple approach to church organization.

The second group began in western Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia), and was led by Thomas Campbell and his son, Alexander. They called themselves "Disciples of Christ," reflecting their emphasis on submitting to and following Christ. Their name has remained constant through two centuries of their existence as a religious body.

Both groups held several central beliefs in common: Jesus is the Christ, the son of God; Christians should have communion each Sunday; and baptism of adult believers by immersion in water is a necessary step toward salvation.

In 1832, the two groups merged in Lexington, Kentucky. Stone-Campbell churches grew quickly in number and membership during this time, often using the name Christian Church, but occasionally using Church of Christ. (Church of Christ was used more frequently throughout the nineteenth century.)

At the time of the Cane Ridge Revival in 1801, Barton Stone was a Presbyterian minister and Cane Ridge was a Presbyterian congregation. By 1804 Stone and five of his colleagues were ready to leave Presbyterianism, a decision they described in the Last Will and Testament of the Springfield Presbytery, considered to be the first of the Stone-Campbell manifestos.

In this document, these six ministers announced their intention to withdraw from Presbyterianism in order to be solely part of the body of Christ. In the Last Will and Testament they outlined vital points in the subsequent development of Stone-Campbell theology: the importance of the unity of all believers, the value of congregational self-governance, the use of the Bible as the source for understanding the will of God, and rejection of man-made creeds and confessions, specifically the Calvinist Augsburg Confession.

The Campbells, father Thomas and son Alexander, began their movement in 1809 with the publication of Thomas Campbell's Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington, arguably the most comprehensive statement of principles on which the Disciples of Christ built the Christian Church. Campbell made an extensive plea for how the body of Christ should be constituted, describing his intent to organize the Christian Association of Washington (Washington County, Pennsylvania) as an association of people seeking to grow as a faith community. In 1811, the Association established itself as the Brush Run Church.

Thomas and Alexander Campbell's studies of the New Testament led them to practice baptism by immersion. Over the next decade the Disciples, led by the Campbells, were associated with the Baptists, but over time they found that their common belief in baptism by immersion was not enough to compensate for their many points of disagreements. There was strong opposition to Alexander Campbell's efforts to promote reform in his journal The Christian Baptist.

One of the guiding principles of The Christian Baptist was the use of reasoning to distinguish between essential and non-essential aspects of New Testament Christianity. Campbell's reliance in discerning matters of faith reflects the influence of Scottish Enlightenment Philosophy on his thinking. His list of essentials included weekly communion, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, congregational autonomy, and a plurality of elders in each congregation. Practices he rejected as non-essential were the holy kiss, deaconesses, communal living, footwashing, fasting, and charaismatic exercises.

In 1828, Thomas Campbell met evangelist Walter Scott and heard him preach. Campbell believed that Scott was bringing a great new contribution to the Disciples of Christ by his extraordinary success in evangelizing and his enthusiastic embrace of efforts to restore the New Testament church. Walter Scott's success in bringing members to the Disciples of Christ has earned him a place in the list of Stone-Campbell founders.

The merger of Stone's Christians and Campbell's Disciples of Christ occurred on January 1, 1832 at the High Street Meeting House in Lexington, Kentucky. It was symbolized by a handshake between Stone and "Raccoon" John Smith representing the Disciples. The two groups agreed on the imperative of restoring New Testament Christianity, achieving both unity and freedom. The commitment to restoration, unity and freedom was sufficient to combine the two groups into a single faith community.

In the first few decades of the nineteenth century the Disciples of Christ experienced significant growth. However, in the late 1840s and especially in the 1850s worldly issues began to intrude upon the spiritual concerns of all the American churches. The Disciples of Christ were no exception.

Generally, Disciples adopted the prevalent attitudes of the section in which they lived in their opinions on the question of slavery. Most Disciples in the South, many of them slaveholders, favored the institution of slavery, and defended it on a biblical basis. On the other hand, Northern Disciples opposed slavery, and a significant minority of them became passionate abolitionists, pressing for immediate emancipation. Alexander Campbell's sister, Jane Campbell McKeever, provided a haven along the Underground Railroad, in her home not far from the Mason-Dixon Line.

The Disciples of Christ were most numerous in the border states, upper South, and the Midwest, with the result that a majority of members could be described as moderates. Whether pro-slavery or opposed to slavery, this large group felt that the importance of unity in the church overrode other considerations and worked hard to keep silent on the growing national crisis. In addition, many of the leaders of this group were committed pacifists and were determined that the church not send its members to war, no matter what the cause.

Of course, they did not succeed, and when the war came in 1861, thousands of Disciples on both sides put on their new uniforms and went to fight. Among them were Barton Stone, Jr. and Alexander Campbell, Jr., both officers in the Confederate Army. In the words of historian David Edwin Harrell, "In the heat of passion, Disciples killed their brethren."

Once the war ended, the old sectional animosities remained in spite of calls for reconciliation. In fact, among the causes of the division of the Disciples of Christ, regional differences must be included.

Other internal issues deepened the strains among the Disciples: the establishment of the American Christian Missionary Society in 1849 and the use of musical instruments in worship, about which discussion also began in 1849. Opponents of missionary societies and instrumental music in worship argued that the New Testament did not authorize either the societies and instrumental music, while supporters maintained that they allowed on the basis of expediency and Christian liberty. Tellingly, the affluent, urban congregations, most of them located in the North, were more likely to add musical instruments to their worship, while poorer, rural congregations, mostly in the South, tended to reject them as non-scriptural, worldly innovations.

Other issues that led to the separation of Churches of Christ from the Disciples of Christ included the proper training and role of clergy in the church, changing approaches to interpreting scripture, ecumenism, and, to a lesser extent, the proper role of women in the church.
In the late nineteenth century the rift deepened between those Disciples who favored unity over restoration and those Disciples who opposed innovations and valued restoration of New Testament Christianity above unity. The latter group increasingly used the name Churches of Christ, while the former group retained the name Disciples of Christ.

Although division in the Disciples of Christ can be traced to the antebellum era and had been recognized in published reports as early as 1883, the Churches of Christ were listed as a separate and distinct group for the first time in the U. S. Religious Census of 1906.
The basic difference on which most of the other differences were based in the approach to interpreting the scriptures. For the Disciples of Christ, it was generally held that any practice not expressly forbidden could be favorably considered. For the Churches of Christ any practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible.

In the 1920s, the questions of biblical interpretation and open membership (admission to membership of people who had been baptized in a method other than immersion) began to drive new wedges in the Disciples of Christ.

The cooperative Christian Church had fully embraced missionary societies by this time, merging their three societies in the United Christian Missionary Society (UCMS). And they greatly increased their social gospel efforts through establishing the National Benevolent Association, which provided assistance to the poor, the orphans, the elderly, and the disabled.

The more independent Christian Churches took the position that these organizations moved the church too far away from the New Testament example, and they rejected open membership outright. The independent churches also had serious doubts about the methods of the new Biblical Criticism being taught in some of the seminaries, which questioned the nineteenth century belief in the literal, factual truth of the entire Bible.

By 1926 another split began to form within the Disciples of Christ over the future direction of the church. Conservatives began to have problems with the perceived liberalism of the leadership, feeling that the church was moving too far from the New Testament pattern. In 1927 the conservatives held their separate North American Christian Convention (NACC) for the first time, and the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ began to emerge as a distinct group from the Disciples of Christ, although the break was not totally formalized until the late 1960s.

During the 1950s and 1960s the Disciples of Christ held a number of discussions on how to more effectively meet the needs of the postwar era. In 1960 at their International Convention of Christian Churches, the Disciples adopted a process to restructure the entire church. The Commission on Restructure held its first meeting in the fall of 1962. Six years later at the 1968 International Convention, the cooperative Christian Churches adopted a provisional design for their organization and missions, officially becoming the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).

Those congregations that chose not to be associated with the new denominational organization separated from the Disciples and took the name Christian Churches and Churches of Christ, completing a departure that had begun decades before.

The Disciples adopted the Commission of Restructure's "Provisional Design of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) at the 1968 International Convention, and the design was implemented in 1969, at the first General Assembly of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). With this act, the Disciples became a denominational part of mainstream American Protestantism.

Today, these three distinct churches make up the bulk of the Stone-Campbell fellowship. There are now Stone-Campbell churches all over the world, beginning in the United Kingdom in the late nineteenth century, and spreading to almost all the continents due to the missionary efforts of all three groups.

The Christian Churches/Churches of Christ and the Churches of Christ have consistently their maintained their non-denominational status since their separation from the Disciples, while the Disciples of Christ have fully embraced denominationalism.

Generally speaking, the Christian Churches/Churches of Christ and the Churches of Christ have retained their emphasis on the restoration of the New Testament church and on individual salvation. The Disciples' theology of the preset day places great emphasis on ecumenism, social justice, and diversity, and continues its longstanding tradition of placing a high priority on the social gospel.

All Stone-Campbell groups still hold several beliefs in common: a commitment to the "priesthood of all believers" while, at the same time, maintaining a high view of the eldership, the necessity of weekly communion, the appropriateness of baptism by immersion and the principle of congregational autonomy.

In addition, representatives from the three main Stone-Campbell groups meet together in ministries of reconciliation, including Disciples of Christ Historical Society; and more formally in the Stone-Campbell Dialogue, sponsored by the Disciples' Council on Christian Unity; and in the World Convention.

It is unrealistic to expect that the churches will ever formally re-unite, but through these initiatives and more informal personal avenues, a level of unity and understanding is being reached that was missing in the Stone-Campbell fellowship during the many decades of disagreement and division.

From August 6-12, as many as 20,000 people came to Cane Ridge, northeast of Lexington, for a sacramental meeting often remembered as “America’s Pentecost.” For over a year strange occurrences had been reported at revivals in southern and central Kentucky: jerks, barking, “falling down” and piercing shrieks accompanied fervent preaching and singing.

The first of the Stone-Campbell manifestos, Stone and five of his colleagues describe their decision to leave Presbyterianism.

Declaration & Address


When Thomas Campbell arrived in America in 1807 he discovered a rancor not unlike that which he fled in Ireland. His attempts to bridge the divide between Presbyterian groups were met with censure from his presbytery and synod. He and a few dozen like-minded individuals established the Christian Association of Washington, Pennsylvania to foster evangelical Christianity. The Declaration and Address consists of the purposes, objectives and rationale for the Christian Association. Though inaccessible for most of the first hundred years of the movement it sparked, it was reissued for the 1909 Pittsburgh Centennial Celebration.

From the creators of God's Not Dead! When a local pastor is shaken to the core by the visible faith of an elderly street-corner preacher, he's reminded that true belief always requires action. His response ignites a faith-fueled journey that powerfully impacts everybody it touches in ways that only God can orchestrate.  Rated PG-13. Dove approved (12+). Approx. 120 minutes.

 From the studio that brought you War Room and Miracles from Heaven comes a captivating new film!  All Saints is based on the inspiring true story of salesman-turned-pastor Michael Spurlock (John Corbett, My Big Fat Greek Weeding), the tiny church he was ordered to shut down, and a group of refugees from Southeast Asia. Together, they risked everything to plant seeds for a future that might just save them all. Look for it in theaters nationwide August 25!
