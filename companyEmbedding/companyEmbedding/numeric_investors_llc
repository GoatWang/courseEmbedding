What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

Instant Business Financing: Your Way Forward
Taking your business to the next level requires a few things: hard work, ingenuity, determination and the cash flow to make your vision a reality. Money doesn’t grow on trees, but it does grow companies.
You guide the funding, we provide it. Simple. Quick. Transparent.
In the rapidly-changing world of commerce, businesses require solutions that move just as fast as the economy they are a part of. Cash flow loans shouldn’t require waiting months; they should enable owners and operators to get the job done as soon as they can.
Old-school avenues to small business financing require six-month waiting periods, excellent credit history and filling out dozens of pages of paperwork. Bank loans are often reserved for those with excellent credit, plenty of collateral and the luxury of being able to wait months for approval. Traditional lenders make their process time-consuming and complex, with multiple identity checks and proofs of ownership. Our business financing ethos is different.
Fast Capital 360 gives you the amount of funding you need in days, not weeks or months. We’ve built our business funding company around the idea that you shouldn’t have to wait, you should be able to receive your cash flow quickly.
Since 2009, our instant small business financing services have enabled thousands of companies to realize their fullest potential. We believe in the power of the local economy, and we want to influence it to do great things; that’s why we work with small business owners across the country.  Our instant business loans fuel innovation from coast to coast.
Whether you’re in the market for SBA loans or unsecured funding, we’re here to provide you with the funds you need.


HOW FAST IS FAST?10 minutes stands between you and knowing how much funding you qualify for. Your small business loan can arrive in your bank account in as little as one business day. No collateral required.
The average online application process takes less than 10 minutes and is only a page long. Once your financing program is approved, your working capital funding can arrive by the end of the next business day.
WE KEEP THINGS EASY & QUICKThere are no long clauses to wade through, no complicated terms and conditions, just plain language that clearly defines what you’re getting in a fast approval business loan. Fast Capital 360 is a member of the Responsible Business Lending Coalition; we were founded on the principles of lending fairness and transparency. We aren’t here to put you in debt; we’re here to fund the American dream.
QUALIFICATIONS?To qualify for instant funding, your small business needs to have been in operation for more than a year, have a revenue of at least $180,000, and you need to have a personal credit score of 500 or more. Our quick business lending is unsecured, so you don’t have to pledge personal assets or collateral just to receive a loan.



Get a Business Loan Today
We designed our process around getting small businesses the money they need quickly. Fast is in our name for a reason. Our application takes next to no time so you can get back to doing what you do best — running your business.
We’ve been voted the best small business funding company by CrowdReviews.com because of our dedication to supporting the economy that we are all a part of with fast approval loans.
The process of receiving funding for your expansion, your repairs, your staffing or your vision shouldn’t make running your business any more difficult. This is instant business funding without the hassle. We want you to have your money quick; you probably have better things to do than wait around for an approval letter.
From microloans to new property purchases, our fast funding process has been there for thousands of businesses. We offer multiple business loan options from lending that functions like a credit card to those that work the same as a bank loan, all with cash delivered faster than ever before.
Whether you have questions about receiving instant restaurant funding or your current working capital funding, our small business advisors are standing by six days a week to help.
Business factoring services allow you to know the exact amount you’ll pay and make our funding work even faster. Through our proprietary business analysis, we determine a precise factor rate that is included in our financing program. This business factor rate is included in the fast approval loan. Where banks charge interest rates, our business factoring services clearly outline how much is to be included in each payment from the start to the finish of the term.
Rather than taking out another credit card, our online business lending services allows you a safer alternative that provides you with more accessible business cash and less likelihood of accruing debt. Better than the banks, our commercial financing programs get business owners the money they need faster than anyone else.
A quick business funding solution that encompasses every need? That’s Fast Capital 360.
Still on the fence?
For more information on why Fast Capital 360 is the best choice for shaping your business into what you know it can be, call us today at 800-735-6107 or contact us online.

                                We believe our approach to investing is reflected in our culture: It is disciplined and analytical, yet reflective and collegial.                            



























We are disciplined and analytical, yet reflective and collegial










We believe our approach to investing is reflected in our culture: It is disciplined and analytical, yet reflective and collegial. We hold ourselves to a high standard of excellence, encourage transparency and open-dialogue, and believe in empowerment with accountability.
Our investment team consists of a mix of thoughtful, seasoned professionals, with backgrounds from some of the largest and most well-regarded investment firms in the business, complemented by portfolio managers and researchers who joined out of school and gained their experience with us. We have long-held beliefs with respect to successful investing yet remain open to new, value-added ideas.




Our research and portfolio management teams are fully integrated. We believe the combination of these skill sets and perspectives will directly benefit our clients. The portfolio managers' skill set includes market knowledge of the fundamental drivers for individual and cohorts of stocks acquired through years of experience engaging security analysts and closely following companies. Our researchers provide a complementary skill set in the form of higher-level quantitative and programming skills that are applied to the development and improvement of our systematic investment process.
The combination of these two skill sets provides for a highly sophisticated, intuitive, and fundamental approach to making investment decisions. We do not make decisions about our investment process simply from observing a pattern in historical data without regard to some fundamental economic rationale for why we may see potential for persistency. This integrated structure makes each career path independent but provides the opportunity for interested personnel to cross over, if desired.
Beyond our investment professionals, our strong infrastructure includes traders, operations, client service, and systems professionals who provide a framework upon which our investment skills are supported. We work hard to maintain a client-centric culture of compliance and high ethical standards.

The devil is in the details

One persistent narrative across the investment industry is that quantitative strategies are all the same. We analyze the same data, read the same research and use the same concepts to identify attractive opportunities. But at Man Numeric, we believe the devil is in the details. How one adjusts and transforms that common dataset could make a significant difference to the risk and return profile created by a particular model, including differentiating between real alpha and what has become known as 'smart beta'. This paper is also accompanied by a video, recorded as part of Man Numeric's Unconventional Views series.


                                    31 MARCH 2016

Conventional thinking is that all quantitative managers are the same. We analyze the same data, read the same academic research, and use the same concepts to identify attractive stocks. But the unconventional view is that the devil is in the details. How one adjusts and transforms that common dataset makes a big difference in the returns and risk profile of a particular model, including differentiating between alpha and what has become known as smart beta.
Value is the foundation on which many quantitative equity investment strategies are built. It started fundamentally with Graham and Dodd in the 1930’s and exploded quantitatively in the 1980’s and 1990’s as the data and computing power improved. Buying cheap stocks based on a particular metric such as earnings, asset value, or cash flow or even a more sophisticated value model may all seem similar to the uninitiated. But most value models have certain persistent biases. Cheap stocks usually have some warts; they tend to be lower growth, more levered, and riskier. As an investor, when you want to buy value as a concept, you are not trying to gain exposure to growth, leverage, or risk. If you can eliminate those biases, you can design a model that gets to the core of the concept without some of the toxic baggage. Yes, quantitative investing is very scientific, but there is some art involved in how you construct a particular signal.
Let’s take a look at how detailed adjustments can affect the efficacy of value models that most people would think would be highly correlated. The chart below shows the returns of five U.S. value models in increasing levels of sophistication, over the last dozen years.

Firstly, the Fama-French High minus Low portfolio1. The Fama French studies are the basis of the value orientation of many quantitative managers, but focuses solely on book to price. That has a 2.3% annual return with 8% volatility.
Then we have the Industry adjusted Earnings to Price model2. Selecting the cheapest companies based on earnings to price compared to industry peers. That has a 6% return with 10% volatility.
Now let’s look at the Barra Value3 – calculated by MSCI Barra that uses multiple indicators to measure cheapness such as sales, assets, and operating income. It has a 6.8% return and 10% volatility.
Our Proprietary Fair Value Model4 – uses industry relative valuation, with adjustments for growth, quality, and a stock’s risk. That has an 8.9% return, and 8.7% volatility.
As you can see, the returns become progressively better as the value models become more evolved. Additionally, the volatility of the models decreases as the signals are neutralized to some of their inherent biases. These effects are not just manifested in value models. We observe them in models like Momentum and Quality as well. The devil is not just in the details of how one constructs individual models, it is also relevant in how you combine the models into an overall signal to construct your portfolio.
Smart beta has gained a lot of attention in the recent years. Proponents of factor-based smart beta portfolios advocate that you gain exposure to these academically proven concepts like Value and Momentum in transparent, rules-based portfolios. However these generic factors can be cyclical, subject to periods of underperformance, and contain unwanted biases. Making detailed adjustments can help smooth out some of this volatility and perhaps make your smart beta, alpha.
1. Fama-French Factor – HML (High minus Low) is the average return on the two value portfolios minus the average return on the two growth portfolios. From Ken French Website: http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/f-f_....
2. Industry-adjusted Earnings/Price – Normalized earnings to price on an industry-adjusted basis. Quintile spreads on the Numeric US universe (~3,000 stocks).
3. Barra Value – Quintile spreads of G2 Value on the Numeric US universe (~3,000 stocks). Source: MSCI Barra.
4. Proprietary Fair Value Model – Quintile spreads on the Numeric US universe (~3,000 stocks).

With Numeric's great track record combined with Man group's name brand kicking in, business has been great. Man also supplies Numeric with a lot of support in both hard dollars and infrastructure that allows research to move forward.-Given the growth path of the firm, there are a lot of new opportunities for new employees to take charge of. You can be given responsibility for areas of research that the firm is venturing into, and you would be greatly rewarded if you were to succeed. There are a lot of opportunities for quants confident in their research abilities.-You are very close to the top. The CEO was promoted from my direct manager's position (head of research) and members of management are generally very accessible. They are reasonable in responding to your requests as well. They will always hear out your argument, and either help you implement your recommendations, or give you a very logically reasoned out answer as to why they will not pursue it. It leaves a good feeling even when you disagree.-The firm is a good combination of being innovative and being practical. They give you a lot of room to pursue the research problem however you want, and generally give you the support to do so. Though, of course, they also apply a reasonable amount of pressure so you can come out with research conclusions to help the business move forward.Cons-Coming with the inflection in growth and the career growth opportunities is a less defined culture in a fast growing firm. Hiring is happening very quickly to match the success of the firm business wise, and the outlook is great. However, it is uncertain how the culture can shift. Management is investing a lot to preserve the small company feel, but only time will tell how the cultural transition will work out.-Boston cost of living is on the rise. I still like the city, but don't expect too much of a drop in cost of living when moving here from New York.Advice to ManagementContinue working hard to define the culture as the place grows, and you will end up with a prosperous and successful firm.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Numeric Investors LLC Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Numeric Investors LLC 2017-03-08 11:05 PST Jan 24, 2017"Place where you can architect your career goals yourself"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Boston, MACurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Boston, MARecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Numeric Investors LLC full-time (More than 3 years)Pros- Open Door Policy.- Collaborative environment- Environment is flexible enough to design a perfect work-life balance for everyone and tailor their career goals accordingly.- Management is considering lot of measures to retain and develop the young employees which is a good sign.- Your efforts are being recognized and there is a good feedback channel for self-improvements.- Firm is open to change and adopting to new environment.Cons- With Man coming in it is becoming more corporate but still trying it's best to keep a small-firm culture- company is going through lot of changes (which is good as they are adopting to new environments).

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
