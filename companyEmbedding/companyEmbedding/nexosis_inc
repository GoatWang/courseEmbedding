Nexosis Inc., a data analytics startup that helps retailers and restaurants forecast how much inventory to stock – down to the ketchup packets at a fast-food store, has closed a $5 million seed round, CEO Ryan Sevey said Friday.
The round in the Westerville startup was led by Revel Partners of New York City, a venture capital firm formed by five serial entrepreneurs that's had three acquisitions and an IPO from its portfolio in the past two years.

Nexosis had reported picking up some "sizable accounts" after going through this summer’s Techstars & Target Retail Accelerator near Target Corp.’s Minneapolis headquarters, plus an integration with the e-commerce platform Shopify to get access to its retailers. Nexosis' machine-learning software looks at several data sources and online sentiment to more accurately predict future demand for products, such as how many small T-shirts a store should stock.




It's already made four hires upon closing the round this month, growing to 13 employees, Sevey said.
"We’ll be growing pretty rapidly here," he said. "A large investment is being put into product development."
Also participating in the round were: Techstars Ventures, the investing arm of the Boulder, Colorado-based startup accelerator; iNovia Capital Partners, of Montreal, Canada; Evalue, of Berlin, Germany, which has joined other Revel deals; and Matchstick Ventures of Minneapolis.
"We see them (all) adding a lot of value," Sevey said, in the form of experience running subscription software firms and introductions to potential customers.
Nexosis reported a total of 14 investors in the round starting in mid-November in a Form D filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The company didn't officially start raising money until finishing Techstars, but it had formed a relationship with Revel months before the accelerator. Several funds made offers, Sevey said. The company now has some capital cushion heading into the next few years.




 


"Going out and raising another round isn’t something any of us want to do in the next 12 months," he said.

Sevey told me in an earlier interview that Nexosis came about almost "by accident." He and co-founder Jason Montgomery met while working at American Electric Power Company Inc. On the side they started studying machine learning – artificial intelligence software that "learns" from the patterns of input without further human intervention.
They were pursuing cybersecurity and made some YouTube videos, attracting a call from Northern Bottling Co., a Pepsico bottler in Minot, North Dakota, asking for help to solve a problem of unpredictably running out of Aquafina.
Northern Bottling President William Gokey II is the only outside director listed on the Form D. The bottling plant led a $1.1 million investment in Nexosis this spring. A Revel representative will join the board.
Nexosis is now preparing white papers based on customers' use of the software, such as how they've made more sales by avoiding going out of stock during key shopping rushes, without carrying too much inventory. It can add to that Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping data.
"We have tons of very interesting data points about what was being forecasted for those major retail holidays," Sevey said. "It paints a very compelling story."

The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Nexosis (Columbus, OH (US)) in May-2016.InterviewThe process of Nexosis started out well. I applied online and got an invitation to interview fairly quickly. My initial interview was a 30 minute phone call with the lead software engineer. The conversation focused on my experience (or lack thereof) in Product Management and my philosophy surrounding the product development process (scrum, agile, lean, etc.).After my interview, I sent a Thank You note and inquired about next steps. Three weeks and a couple of follow-ups later, I get a note indicating that the hiring decision is with "management" and the ONLY person I've spoken to about the position is "out of the loop." I never heard back.Keep in mind, this is a startup with no more than a dozen employees at the time of my interview. So, the utterly broken hiring process and the complete lack of initiative to uncover the information I was seeking suggests that this company is never going to attract the necessary talent to be a success.Interview Questions What is your product management experience?   Answer Question How do you envision the Product Owner and the Development team working together?   Answer Question Nexosis 2017-03-30 13:25 PDT See All 1 Interviews Nexosis Awards & Accolades+ Add AwardsTop 50 Retail Tech Startups Worldwide, Insider Trends, 2016 2016Top 50 Retail Tech Startups Worldwide, Insider Trends, 2016Work at Nexosis?
