Cloud Peak Energy Logistics LLC Key Developments

Cloud Peak Energy Modifies Throughput and Transportation Agreements with Westshore Terminals and BNSF Railway Company
Feb 15 17
Cloud Peak Energy Inc. announced that Cloud Peak Energy Logistics LLC replaced its throughput agreement with Westshore Terminals Limited Partnership and its transportation agreement with BNSF Railway Company (BNSF). Under the new agreements, which are effective commencing January 2017 for the throughput agreement and April 2017 for the transportation agreement, Cloud Peak Energy made upfront payments and also committed to minimum payments through 2018. The outstanding undiscounted commitments are approximately $51 million through the current two year term of these agreements. Both agreements provide that the parties may extend the agreements through the end of 2019 if elected. In addition, Westshore has certain priority rights on throughput capacity in respect of any export shipments by Cloud Peak Energy through 2024. The original throughput and transportation agreements and underlying take-or-pay commitments, which have now been replaced, previously would have expired at the end of 2024.


Cloud Peak Energy Logistics LLC Amends Throughput Agreement with Westshore Terminals Limited Partnership to Address Depressed International Conditions
Oct 28 15
Cloud Peak Energy Inc. announced that Cloud Peak Energy Logistics LLC entered into an amended throughput agreement with Westshore Terminals Limited Partnership to eliminate both parties’ volume obligations for the period 2016 through 2018 in exchange for a series of payments. Under the amended agreement, Cloud Peak Energy made an upfront payment to Westshore and will make quarterly payments from 2016 through 2018 in lieu of the previous take-or-pay commitments during this three-year period. If this amendment were in effect as of September 30, 2015, the company’s outstanding undiscounted port take-or-pay commitments at that time would have been approximately $454 million through the remaining term of the agreement if they do not ship any export tons. Except as amended, the original throughput agreement remains in place through the end of 2024. The parties will meet on a quarterly basis during the next several years to discuss market conditions and any potential shipments and the terms for any shipments. If export shipments do not occur, it is expected that Spring Creek Mine production volumes will be reduced accordingly.

About Us
Our Mission Statement
Cloud Peak Energy aims to be a leading energy producer operating in a safe, responsible and caring manner.

We will operate in accordance with our values.
We will not lose sight of our goal of maximizing the long-term financial return to our shareholders.
We believe that by ensuring the safety and long-term health of our employees are not compromised and that by being a good neighbor in the communities in which we live and work, value will be maximized.
We will run the business in a sustainable way to ensure we maintain our “license to operate” (i.e. support of employees, communities, regulators, elected officials, customers, suppliers).

Our current strategy is to build on our strong US domestic position to develop our export sales and explore international production opportunities.



Our Values
Cloud Peak Energy’s values are the underlying principles that guide the way we do business. We will hold each other accountable to not deviate from these values in all our business dealings.
Safety – The safety of everyone involved in our business will never be compromised.
Caring – We care about the impact of our actions on people and the environment both inside and outside the company.
Honesty – We are honest and transparent in all interactions with each other and those outside the company.
Courage – We will be courageous in all our dealings and will hold ourselves accountable for our actions and not avoid difficult issues.
Respect – We will show respect to all those involved in every interaction and work to engage all our employees in the business.

Operations[edit]
The firm operates three open pit mines from thick deposits in Wyoming and Montana.[4]
Crow Nation[edit]
The firm has contracted with the Crow Nation to mine 20 million tons of coal annually on its reservation for shipment by rail to coal terminals in the Pacific Northwest for shipment to Asia. The project is called the Big Metal Project after a legendary Crow chief.[5] Big Metals Coal is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cloud Peak. The facilities of Cloud Peak's Spring Creek Mine are located directly to the east of the reservation and will be available for the use of Big Metal.[6]
