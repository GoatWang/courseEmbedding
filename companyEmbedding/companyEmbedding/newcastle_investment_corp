Newcastle Investment Corp.: 3 Big Post-Earnings Developments
Newcastle Investment Corp. reported a good quarter, following through on steps necessary to become a pure-play senior housing REIT.











                Jordan Wathen
            

                (TMFValueMagnet)



            
            Nov 4, 2013 at 6:53PM
            
            





To say that Newcastle Investment Corp. (NYSE:NCT) is complex would be the understatement of the year. The REIT owns a hodge-podge of financial assets ranging from senior housing to debt investments and newspapers.
Yes, newspapers! This isn't your average REIT.
The company's third-quarter earnings report was relatively benign, but three things stuck out to me:
1. It's actually becoming a senior housing REIT... maybeI've been critical of Newcastle Investment Corp in earlier articles, particularly one about its new newspaper investments it now calls New Media. At the time -- and even now -- newspapers seem like one giant distraction on the company's quest to become a senior housing-focused REIT.
However, the company made some progress on the senior housing front. It acquired $301 million of new assets, using $200 million of debt and $101 of cash equity. In all, Newcastle has 19 new communities under its growing umbrella.





The majority of the new acquisitions (15) were in Florida, an obvious market for a senior housing investor. The Florida purchase is particularly notable because of its size, but also because of the potential for operating improvements. Newcastle's latest quarterly filing shows an average occupancy rate of 80.1% for its recent acquisition. Rival Health Care REIT (NYSE:HCN) has an average occupancy rate of 90.1% in its senior housing portfolio, according to the company's last quarterly supplement. Newcastle Investment Corp. investors should use Health Care REIT's portfolio as an example for the potential profits in senior housing.
All in all, Newcastle reports levered yields from its new investments at 12%. Modest rental increases and vacancy rate improvements could send that quickly up to its target of 20% per year on its equity investment. Management noted that it had big senior housing deals in the pipeline, one of which includes a potential equity investment of $152 million to 200 million.
2. Newspaper spinoff to make headlines in JanuaryNewcastle now expects to take control of newspaper company GateHouse Media, form New Media, and spin off New Media in a stock dividend perhaps as early as January 2014. New Media is without a doubt the biggest question mark for Newcastle shareholders.
Newcastle will own roughly 59% of New Media, according to the September presentation. Using its expected funds from operations of $74 million for 2014, New Media should deliver $43.66 million in earnings power to current Newcastle shareholders.





How the company prices at its initial public offering is the most important part of the puzzle. If priced at a 10% yield, current Newcastle shareholders would see their ownership worth $436.6 million, or roughly one-fourth of Newcastle Investment's current market value.
We'll know more about the company when Newcastle can file a full S-1 for a spinoff with the SEC. The company still has to form New Media and leverage it with debt under the new subsidiary before taking it public as a stand-alone company.
3. More CDO realizationsNewcastle's collateralized debt obligations play an important role in its move to become a senior housing REIT. This quarter, it restructured one collateralized debt obligation, selling a senior tranche for $88 million in cash while holding onto a $12 million position.
The CDOs and debt investments are Newcastle's piggy bank as it makes its transformation. When asked on the conference call if Newcastle would continue to liquidate its other CDOs, CEO Kenneth Riis said, "They are generating still good returns and good cash flows for us. I think as assets payoff and deleverage the transactions then we will look to potentially harvest the capital out of those."





He later added that "[e]ven if it's a slightly lower return initially, it's a positive thing for us, because that capital will be traded at a higher returns than our CDO assets would," referencing that he's willing to cash in on the CDOs to invest in real estate. He's right: Wall Street will likely value the cash flows from senior housing much higher than money from alphabet-soup CDOs.
Slow and steady improvements all aroundNewcastle Investment shareholders should be happy with the company's transition to a senior housing REIT. Though the newspaper business has served as a distraction, the IPO would set Newcastle up to become a high-yield senior housing asset with dividends that are well above other senior housing companies like Health Care REIT. Newcastle Investment's immediate 12% levered yields on new acquisitions are proof that there is plenty of money to be made as an equity REIT. Now it just needs to execute.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

I’m looking for a financial advisor who will spend time educating me on investment topics and answering my questions.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.





We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.

Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.


Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.


School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.


Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.

Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.

Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.
