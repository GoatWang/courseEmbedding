            Oakes, Lyman: Is This the Model for Building European Device Companies?
        




        Despite outstanding clinical science, Europe has historically lagged behind the US, if not in medical device innovation, at least in device company creation.  A vicious cycle of few start-ups, reluctant VCs, and a poor pool of experienced managers has kept company creation from exploding.  But now former merchant bankers turned serial entrepreneurs, Herb Oakes and Dick Lyman, believe they have a better formula for starting device companies in Europe.

            Neotropix Inc.
        


        By Marc Wortman


        Neotropix Inc. believes it is on the right track to develop a virus that just infects cancer cells, at least for cancers with specific neuroendocrine properties -- a feat that would amount to the mythic "silver bullet" cancer cure.

        A re-start of DirectGene Inc., Advagen Inc. will marry its gene therapy for prostate cancer to newly in-licensed IP covering small peptide ligands with an affinity for the PSMA receptor. The company believes its new platform will greatly enhance adenovirus targeting and facilitate systemic delivery of gene therapies for a variety of cancers.
