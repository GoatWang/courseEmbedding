Elizabeth, Akyem"The company's inclusion and diversity strategy creates an enabling environment where everyone is accepted and is part of the Newmont family."












Joseph, Ahafo“One of the many things I have learned at Newmont is to make safety a priority for myself, my family, and community. This is what the company values and encourages among its employees and communities. I am a safety ambassador at work and anywhere else I go. I am part of the Newmont safety system, a system that works.”












Evangelina, Yanacocha“I am very grateful for the opportunity that Yanacocha gave me; before entering to the company I could not even ride a bicycle. The eldest of my children tells me that when he grows up, he also wants to handle those huge trucks that are in the mine.” 












Karla, Phoenix Mine Site“Working at Newmont has given me the opportunity to have training on haul trucks, water trucks and rubber tire dozers. Being trained on all kinds of equipment, working with a great crew and taking safety with me everywhere are just a few of the benefits”.

Newmont Adds Profitable Gold Production through Expansion of Ahafo in Ghana


04/20/2017

Download this Press Release ()

 DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Newmont
      Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) (Newmont or the Company) announced
      plans to extend profitable production at its Ahafo operations by
      building a new underground mine and expanding plant capacity by more
      than 50 percent. The Subika Underground mine is expected to produce 1.8
      million ounces of gold over an 11-year mine life, and features ore
      grades of 4.7 grams per tonne. The mill expansion is expected to improve
      margins and support profitable production at Ahafo through at least 2029.

      “We are building on strong performance and solid infrastructure by
      investing in the next generation of profitable production at Ahafo,”
      said Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The Subika
      Underground mine will also create a platform to support even longer-term
      growth. Recent exploration results demonstrate considerable upside
      within the Subika deposit and adjacent Apensu Deeps deposit.”
    

      The projects have been optimized to improve internal rates of return to
      more than 20 percent at a $1,200 gold price. In the first five full
      years of production – or from 2020 through 2024 – they are forecast to
      add incremental gold production of between 200,000 and 300,000 ounces
      per year at Ahafo for total average annual production of 550,000 to
      650,000 ounces. The projects are also expected to lower unit costs
      during the same time frame. Costs applicable to sales (CAS) are expected
      to decrease by between $150 and $250 per ounce compared to 2016 for
      total average CAS of $650 to $750 per ounce. All-in sustaining costs
      (AISC) are expected to decrease by between $250 and $350 per ounce
      compared to 2016 for total average AISC of $800 to $900 per ounce.i


      Newmont received its environmental permit to build and operate the
      Subika Underground mine in March 2017. The resource has been studied for
      11 years and execution and technical risks are well understood. The
      Company expects to reach first production at the mine in the second half
      of 2017 and commercial production in the second half of 2018.
    

      The Ahafo Mill Expansion will increase annual mill capacity by 50
      percent to nearly 10 million tonnes by adding a crusher, grinding mill
      and leach tanks to the circuit. The expansion supports more efficient
      processing of harder, lower grade ore from existing surface mines, as
      well as Ahafo’s stockpiles and the Subika Underground mine. Newmont
      expects first gold production at the mill expansion in the first half of
      2019 and commercial production in the second half of 2019.
    

      Development capital of between $300 million and $380 million will be
      funded through free cash flow and available cash balances. Newmont will
      uphold local hiring and procurement commitments and existing bargaining
      agreements through construction and operation.
    

      Newmont has one of the strongest project pipelines in the gold sector.
      Last year, the Company built its Merian operation in Suriname on time
      and $150 million below budget, and completed the first phase of its Long Canyon
      mine two months ahead of schedule and $50 million below budget.
    

      Commercial production at Ahafo began in 2006 and the operation achieved
      five million ounces of gold production in October 2016. Three surface
      mines – Subika, Awonsu, Amoma – feed a conventional mill with a
      carbon-in-leach circuit. A fourth surface mine, Apensu, is currently
      being used for water storage.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:


      This release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
      Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E
      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended
      to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other
      applicable laws. Such forward-looking statements may include, without
      limitation, estimates and expectations of future average production,
      average CAS, average AISC, mill capacity and improvements, timing of
      first production and first commercial production, anticipated
      development capital and funding from free cash flow, rates of return and
      other statements relating to future performance. Where the Company
      expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or
      results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and
      believed to have a reasonable basis. However, such statements are
      subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause
      actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or
      implied by the “forward-looking statements.” Risks relating to forward
      looking statements in regard to the Company’s business and future
      performance may include, but are not limited to, gold price volatility,
      currency fluctuations, increased production costs, variances in ore
      grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining plans and other
      operational risks, geotechnical, metallurgical and hydrological risks,
      political and community relations risk, and changes in governmental
      regulation and requirements. For a discussion of such risks relating to
      our business and other factors, see the Company’s Form 10-K, filed on or
      about February 21, 2017, with the Securities and Exchange Commission
      (SEC) under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking
      Statements.” The Company does not undertake any obligation to release
      publicly revisions to any “forward-looking statement,” including,
      without limitation, outlook to reflect events or circumstances after the
      date of this news release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
      events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.
      Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously
      issued “forward-looking statement” constitutes a reaffirmation of that
      statement. Continued reliance on “forward-looking statements” is at
      investors' own risk.

      retirement costs), G&A, exploration expense, advanced projects and R&D,

History[edit]




William Boyce Thompson, founder of Newmont Mining


Early years[edit]
Newmont Mining Corporation was founded in 1916 in New York by Colonel William Boyce Thompson as a holding company to invest in Worldwide mineral, oil, and related companies. According to company lore, the name "Newmont" is a portmanteau "New York" and "Montana", reflecting where Thompson made his fortune and where he grew up.[6]
In 1929, Newmont became a mining company with its first gold product in by acquiring California's Empire Star Mine. By 1939, Newmont was operating 12 gold mines in North America.
The company acquired interests overseas. For decades around the middle of the 20th century, Newmont had a controlling interest in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia and in the O'Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand, South Africa.
Beginning in 1925, Newmont acquired interests in a Texas oil field. Eventually, Newmont's oil interests included more than 70 blocks in the Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico area and oil and gas production in the North Sea.
Newmont discovered the world's first submicroscopic or "invisible" gold at Carlin, Nevada in the early 1960s and began production on the first open pit gold mine in the world. The "Carlin Trend" or "Carlin Unconformity" is the largest gold discovery in North America during the 20th century. In 1971 Newmont began using the heap leaching technology on sub-mill grade ores there.
In the 1980s, Newmont thwarted five takeover bids – from Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold), T. Boone Pickens, Minorco, Hanson Industries and Sir James Goldsmith – who sought to break Newmont apart and sell its assets to increase shareholder value.
Major growth[edit]
After 1987, the company undertook major restructuring. This included the payment of a US$33 per share dividend to all shareholders for a total of US$2.2 billion, of which US$1.75 billion was borrowed. To reduce this debt the company undertook a divestment program involving all of its copper, oil, gas, and coal interests.
As a further step in the restructuring, the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Denver in 1988. A decade later, Newmont Mining Corporation and Newmont Gold Company combined assets to form a unified worldwide gold company. Shareholders of both companies had identical interests in the reserves, production and earnings of Newmont Gold's operations.
Newmont then merged with Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation (a former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway subsidiary, sold in preparation for the merger that produced the BNSF Railway[7]) to form North America's largest gold producer.
On June 21, 2000, Newmont announced a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. The merger was completed in January 2001.
In February 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Normandy Mining Limited and Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited. Newmont faced competition in its bid for Normandy from AngloGold. By eventually outbiding the South African company, Newmont became the world's largest gold producer, with an annual production in excess of 8 million ounces.[8]
In 2007, the company eliminated its 1.5 million ounce legacy hedge book to make Newmont the world’s largest unhedged gold producer. The following year, Newmont acquired Miramar Mining Corporation and its Hope Bay deposit in the Canadian Arctic.
In late 2008, Newmont moved its headquarters from Denver to the suburb of Greenwood Village, Colorado.[9]
In 2009, Newmont purchased the remaining one-third interest in Boddington Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti, bringing its ownership to 100 percent.
In April 2011, the company acquired Canada's Fronteer Gold Inc. for Cdn $2.3 billion. This made the company the world's second-largest gold producer.[10]
Operations and major projects[edit]

Nevada[edit]
As of 2011, Newmont’s Nevada 14 open-pit and four underground operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend; the Phoenix gold/copper mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of Golconda; and the Midas mine, near the town of the same name. It also participates in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
With the acquisition of Fronteer Gold, over sixty additional projects were added to the Newmont portfolio. The flagship property, Long Canyon, is located on a gold trend that is similar to the Carlin Trend in terms of its characteristics and potential.
Colorado[edit]
In August 2015, Newmont purchased the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti. The mine is the largest gold and silver producer in the state of Colorado.[11]
Yanacocha, Peru[edit]
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interest held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha’s mining rights consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines: Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. In addition, reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San Jose and Maqui Maqui are currently underway.
Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million ounces (750,000 attributable ounces). As of December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2011, Newmont’s board of directors granted approval to develop the Conga Project, located in the provinces of Celendín, and Sorochuco Huasmín districts and Cajamarca district of Encañada. Newmont’s ownership interest is identical to Yanacocha. If all permits are secured, the commencement of production is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.[12]
In 2015, agents acting on behalf of Newmont Mining Corporation attacked and beat a woman who refused to move from her home to allow for the development of a mine.
Indigenous Peruvian farmworker Maxima Acuña de Chaupe withstood violent eviction attempts, beatings, and a legal battle to protect her land from being turned into an open-pit gold mine[13]

Australia[edit]
Newmont acquired its Australian assets with the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002.[17][18]
Boddington. Newmont’s newest Australian asset is Boddington, which is now Australia's largest gold producer. It has been wholly owned since June 2009, when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010. As of year-end 2010, it reported 20.3 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves.
Tanami. The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites.
The Tanami operations have been wholly owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests. Operations today are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold. As of December 31, 2010, it had a reported 2.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest.




The Super Pit gold mine


In 2010, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold (377,000 attributable ounces). It reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves on December 31, 2010.
New Zealand[edit]
Newmont acquired its Waihi assets as part of the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002. The Waihi operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves at the end of the year.
Martha. The Martha Mine operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. The open pit mine has operated over historic underground gold mine workings since 1988.
Favona. The Favona underground mine began extracting ore at the end of 2006.
Batu Hijau, Sumbawa, Indonesia[edit]




Haul trucks at the Batu Hijau open pit, 2009


Newmont operates the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa in the Indonesia in the province of West Nusa Tenggara through its subsidiary company P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara which is a joint venture between Newmont, Sumitomo Corporation and P.T. Pukuafu Indah.
Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced 542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable ounces). On December 31, 2010, it reported 3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and 3.7 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2008, the Indonesian government threatened to terminate the contract of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara after accusing it of failing to meet its divestment obligations. On April 1, 2009, international arbitrators and its partner sided with Newmont rejecting Jakarta's request to have their contract revoked, which would have forced the company to walk away from the property without any compensation. Instead Newmont was forced to sell a 17% stake in an Indonesian subsidiary within 180 days.[19]
In 2011, subsidiaries of Newmont and Sumitomo Corporation divested a 7 percent investment in PTNNT. Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), designated as the buyer by the Indonesian Government, signed a sale and purchase agreement for the shares worth $246.8 million. Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V., which holds Newmont’s shares in PTNNT – together with shares held by a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan – now owns 49 percent of PTNNT. Of that amount, Newmont will directly own 27.56 percent of PTNNT and has another 17 percent economic interest through financing arrangements with existing shareholders.[20]
Ghana[edit]
The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Newmont operates four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010.
Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010, reported 10.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Additionally, Newmont’s Akyem Mine (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In January 2010, Newmont received the mining lease. After close to two years of construction, the Akyem mine commenced commercial production in late 2013.
At December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves.
Other operations[edit]
Mexico[edit]
Newmont has a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura produced 174,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, it had 2.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Former operations[edit]
Newmont has purchased and sold a number of operations in recent years:

Golden Grove Mine: Owned by Normandy Mining Limited since 1991, Golden Grove was acquired by Newmont Australia Ltd in February 2002 when Newmont took over Normandy.[21] Newmont sold on the mine to Oxiana Limited in June 2005 for A$265 million.[22]
Pajingo: Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Townsville, Queensland and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. Newmont sold the mine in late 2007; it is now owned by Conquest Mining.
Bronzewing Gold Mine: View Resources purchased the mine in July 2004 from Newmont for A$9.0 million, a package that also included the McClure mining operation, 8 km west of Bronzewing.[23]
Wiluna Gold Mine: Also part of the Normandy acquisition, Gowit Limited, later Agincourt Resources, purchased the mine on 10 December 2003 from Newmont for shares and $3.65 million in cash.[24][25]
Zarafshan: Newmont was part of a joint venture gold project in Uzbekistan, the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A difficult place to operate, Uzbekistan expropriates the company’s assets in 2006.
Kori Kollo: The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont had an 88% interest. The remaining 12% was owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owned and operated the mine. On July 23, 2009, Newmont announced the transfer of its interest in Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., which owned the Kori Kollo gold mine and Kori Chaca gold mine, to Compania Procesadora de Minerales S.A. ("CPM"), a company controlled by Newmont's long-time Bolivian partner Jose Mercado.
Minahasa: Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004.
Golden Giant: Newmont's Canadian operations previously included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) was located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon, Ontario, Canada, and had been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout most of 2006.
Holloway: Holloway was located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson, Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant. It was in production since 1996. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.
Empire-Star: Located in Grass Valley, California, the mine has been closed since 1957

Controversies[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (January 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Nevada operations[edit]
In July 2009, the Mine Safety and Health Administration announced that four supervisors for the Denver-based mining company have agreed to pay a combined $60,000 in individual penalties for their role in the accident at the Midas Mine north of Elko in June 2007. The agency said managers "showed a disregard for the miners' welfare" and acted with "more than ordinary negligence" before the victim fell through a sinkhole while operating a large loader about 200 feet below the entrance of the mine." [26]
State tax deductions[edit]
In March 2011, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval replaced his director of taxation, citing problems in auditing tax deductions.[27] Statements by both Nevada Mining Association President Tim Crowley[28] and Republican Assembly Minority Floor Leader Pete Goicoechea of Eureka County in Nevada (the county where a majority of Newmont's Nevada operations are located)[29] made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper.[30] This prompted the state legislature to call for "emergency regulations" to disallow some tax deductions.[31]
In April 2011, it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions, which had been approved by the Nevada Tax Commission.[30] The outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years.[27] This is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees, such as Robert J Miller, who served a director of Newmont Mining Corporation right after being Governor of Nevada for a decade.[30][not in citation given] Miller was succeeded by the late Kenny Guinn, who proposed a tax restructuring during the 2003 legislative session that was met with opposition from anti-tax business groups and many anti-tax Republicans.[citation needed]
FIN 48 an interpretation of FASB 109 requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities (or litigation).[32]
The 76th Session of the Nevada Legislature (2011), passed Senate Bill 493, over opposition from the mining industry. Senate Bill 493 "...creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, a seven-member panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation. An amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes." Some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections: "'If you don’t let us deduct this, we’ll deduct something else.'" A Newmont Mining Corp. staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction, saying employee housing cut travel costs." [27] The mines in Nevada were to report their deductions to the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, which was created under S.B. 493.[citation needed]
Batu Hijau mine, Indonesia[edit]
On 6 August 2010, a 5 day long strike, which had completely shut US-based Newmont Mining Corp.’s Batu Hijau mines and operations on Sumbawa Island ended after some 1,500 miners of the PT NNT labour union, affiliated to the Chemical, Energy, Mine Workers’ Union of the Indonesia Workers’ Union, agreed to await an overtime pay judgment from a provincial government. "The dispute started some three weeks after the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry of West Nusa Tenggara Province issued an order that management was in arrears on Rp 126 billion (US$13.8 million) in overtime wages to some 1,919 workers dating back to 2008." [33]

Yanacocha mine, Peru[edit]




The "Minera Yanacocha" gold mine near Cajamarca (Peru)


The Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru is considered one of the largest and most profitable in the world, producing over US$7 billion worth of gold to date. Before 1994 the mine was co-owned by Newmont, Buenaventura (a Peruvian mining company), and Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), a French government-owned company. This partnership collapsed in 1994 after BRGM tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an Australian company which was a rival of Newmont. Newmont and Buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade.
Larry Kurlander, then a senior executive at Newmont, claimed the French President Jacques Chirac had sent a letter to then Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the French owned company. Kurlander had been sent by Newmont to Peru to try to get a favorable outcome for Newmont in the dispute. The legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the Peruvian Supreme Court.
During this period Kurlander acknowledges having met with Vladimiro Montesinos, the Peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement, illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, influence peddling and bribing TV stations. [4] [5] However, Kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the French government were taking similar steps in trying to contact Montesinos. The French ambassador to Peru Antoine Blanca denies this, pointing to the fact that Montesinos was on the CIA payroll and thus would naturally side with the U.S-based company.
After the fall of Fujimori in 2000 a number of videos Montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged. In October 2005 Frontline in co-production with The New York Times found a February 1998 recording of a telephone conversation between Montesinos and Kurlander. The following is an excerpt from the tape:

Kurlander:...we have a very serious problem in Peru with our company (Newmont) and Minera Buenaventura so I have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities. I need it especially because the other side (the French government) has been acting quite strangely.


Montesinos (to interpreter): Tell him that I am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the French, as well as the problem he has with the judiciary.


Kurlander: So now you have a friend for life. I want a friend for life.


Montesinos (to interpreter): I thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend. Tell him I'm going to help him with the voting. I would like to know the tricky practices of the French. The French Connection!


Kurlander: The French Connection!


(laughter) [34]

Along with this telephone conversation, Frontline and The New York Times also re-broadcast three other videos. One was filmed in April 1998 and shows Montesinos talking to "Don Arabian", the CIA station chief in Peru, in an attempt to get CIA to pressure the U.S. to back Newmont in the case. In the video Montesinos claims to have found e-mails from Paris to Peru of French officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to France.
Another video recorded in May 1998 shows Montesinos meeting with Peruvian Supreme Court Justice, and former classmate, Jaime Beltran Quiroga. In it Montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between Newmont and BRGM. He tells Quiroga that if the decision goes to Newmont that the United States will back Peru in its border dispute with Ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the Cenepa War. He also tells Quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press. Quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case, his vote would be the deciding vote in the Newmont victory. After the video was first broadcast in Peru in 2001, on a Peruvian local television station the French Ambassador Antoine Blanca was quoted as saying "Now I know why Newmont won".
In the final July 1999 video, Montesinos is again seen with the now departing CIA station chief "Don Arabian" giving him a gift and thanking him for the help he has given Peru stating "[W]e hope that when you're back their [in Washington] you'll remember your friends".
Buyat Bay, Sulawesi, Indonesia[edit]
In August 2004, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment filed a US$133.6 million civil lawsuit against Newmont,[35] claiming tailings from the company's Minahasa Raya mine polluted Buyat Bay in the North Sulawesi province, contaminating local fish stocks and causing nearby villagers to become seriously ill. Newmont denied the allegations, arguing that the illnesses had more to do with poor hygiene and poverty. On November 15, 2005, a South Jakarta court dismissed the suit on technical grounds, saying the government had breached the terms of its contract with Newmont when it took legal action before seeking arbitration. Environmentalists urged for the suit to be appealed, but on December 1, 2005, Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar said the government expected to reach an out-of-court settlement with Newmont's local subsidiary. "By negotiating a settlement, we hope to be able to quickly compensate people living near the mine," he said. The government negotiating team was led by chief Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie. On February 16, 2006, the Indonesian government announced it would settle the civil suit for US$30 million to be paid over the next 10 years. The agreement also includes increased scientific monitoring and enhanced community development programs for the North Sulawesi province.
With the civil lawsuit settled, attention focused on the criminal charges against President Director Richard Ness. In December 2006, Newmont Mining Corp. objected to a documentary entitled Bye Bye Buyat being nominated for Indonesia's top film award, FFI's Citra Award. The company said that it interfered with Ness' ongoing trial.[36]
After a 21-month trial—one of the longest proceedings in Indonesian history—Ness was found innocent of the pollution charges on April 24, 2007.[37] The court found that the company was in compliance with all regulations and permits during its operations at the site, and failed to find evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Nemont's subsidiary had polluted Buyat Bay. At the end of May, the prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.[37]
A week after being found not guilty of criminal charges, Richard Ness sued The New York Times in Indonesian court for libel. The lawsuit asks for nearly US$65 million in damages, and that The New York Times print a page-one retraction of previously published articles.[38] In October 2007 an Indonesian court threw out the suit stating it was not within their jurisdiction. The case was being appealed.[39]
Akyem, Ghana[edit]
Newmont received the 2009 Public Eye award for its Akyem project in Ghana. According to the jury it had destroyed unique natural habitats, carried out forced resettlement of local people and polluted soil and rivers.[40] Newmont described the information as misleading and said the project had been extensively studied by international and national environmental experts, members of the local communities, and by the appropriate governmental agencies and departments.[41]
In January 2010, Ghanaian authorities brought a lawsuit against Newmont Mining for a reported US$4.9 million.[42]. The lawsuit accused Newmont of negligently spilling cyanide at its Ahafo gold mine in October 2009, resulting in water contamination and fish kills.[43] Newmont disputed the accusation, but agreed in March 2010 to pay compensation "in accordance with the law".[44]

History[edit]




William Boyce Thompson, founder of Newmont Mining


Early years[edit]
Newmont Mining Corporation was founded in 1916 in New York by Colonel William Boyce Thompson as a holding company to invest in Worldwide mineral, oil, and related companies. According to company lore, the name "Newmont" is a portmanteau "New York" and "Montana", reflecting where Thompson made his fortune and where he grew up.[6]
In 1929, Newmont became a mining company with its first gold product in by acquiring California's Empire Star Mine. By 1939, Newmont was operating 12 gold mines in North America.
The company acquired interests overseas. For decades around the middle of the 20th century, Newmont had a controlling interest in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia and in the O'Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand, South Africa.
Beginning in 1925, Newmont acquired interests in a Texas oil field. Eventually, Newmont's oil interests included more than 70 blocks in the Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico area and oil and gas production in the North Sea.
Newmont discovered the world's first submicroscopic or "invisible" gold at Carlin, Nevada in the early 1960s and began production on the first open pit gold mine in the world. The "Carlin Trend" or "Carlin Unconformity" is the largest gold discovery in North America during the 20th century. In 1971 Newmont began using the heap leaching technology on sub-mill grade ores there.
In the 1980s, Newmont thwarted five takeover bids – from Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold), T. Boone Pickens, Minorco, Hanson Industries and Sir James Goldsmith – who sought to break Newmont apart and sell its assets to increase shareholder value.
Major growth[edit]
After 1987, the company undertook major restructuring. This included the payment of a US$33 per share dividend to all shareholders for a total of US$2.2 billion, of which US$1.75 billion was borrowed. To reduce this debt the company undertook a divestment program involving all of its copper, oil, gas, and coal interests.
As a further step in the restructuring, the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Denver in 1988. A decade later, Newmont Mining Corporation and Newmont Gold Company combined assets to form a unified worldwide gold company. Shareholders of both companies had identical interests in the reserves, production and earnings of Newmont Gold's operations.
Newmont then merged with Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation (a former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway subsidiary, sold in preparation for the merger that produced the BNSF Railway[7]) to form North America's largest gold producer.
On June 21, 2000, Newmont announced a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. The merger was completed in January 2001.
In February 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Normandy Mining Limited and Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited. Newmont faced competition in its bid for Normandy from AngloGold. By eventually outbiding the South African company, Newmont became the world's largest gold producer, with an annual production in excess of 8 million ounces.[8]
In 2007, the company eliminated its 1.5 million ounce legacy hedge book to make Newmont the world’s largest unhedged gold producer. The following year, Newmont acquired Miramar Mining Corporation and its Hope Bay deposit in the Canadian Arctic.
In late 2008, Newmont moved its headquarters from Denver to the suburb of Greenwood Village, Colorado.[9]
In 2009, Newmont purchased the remaining one-third interest in Boddington Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti, bringing its ownership to 100 percent.
In April 2011, the company acquired Canada's Fronteer Gold Inc. for Cdn $2.3 billion. This made the company the world's second-largest gold producer.[10]
Operations and major projects[edit]




Gold Quarry mine, near Carlin, Nevada, 2009.


Nevada[edit]
As of 2011, Newmont’s Nevada 14 open-pit and four underground operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend; the Phoenix gold/copper mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of Golconda; and the Midas mine, near the town of the same name. It also participates in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
With the acquisition of Fronteer Gold, over sixty additional projects were added to the Newmont portfolio. The flagship property, Long Canyon, is located on a gold trend that is similar to the Carlin Trend in terms of its characteristics and potential.
Colorado[edit]
In August 2015, Newmont purchased the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti. The mine is the largest gold and silver producer in the state of Colorado.[11]
Yanacocha, Peru[edit]
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interest held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha’s mining rights consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines: Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. In addition, reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San Jose and Maqui Maqui are currently underway.
Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million ounces (750,000 attributable ounces). As of December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2011, Newmont’s board of directors granted approval to develop the Conga Project, located in the provinces of Celendín, and Sorochuco Huasmín districts and Cajamarca district of Encañada. Newmont’s ownership interest is identical to Yanacocha. If all permits are secured, the commencement of production is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.[12]
In 2015, agents acting on behalf of Newmont Mining Corporation attacked and beat a woman who refused to move from her home to allow for the development of a mine.
Indigenous Peruvian farmworker Maxima Acuña de Chaupe withstood violent eviction attempts, beatings, and a legal battle to protect her land from being turned into an open-pit gold mine[13]

Australia[edit]
Newmont acquired its Australian assets with the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002.[17][18]
Boddington. Newmont’s newest Australian asset is Boddington, which is now Australia's largest gold producer. It has been wholly owned since June 2009, when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010. As of year-end 2010, it reported 20.3 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves.
Tanami. The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites.
The Tanami operations have been wholly owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests. Operations today are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold. As of December 31, 2010, it had a reported 2.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest.




The Super Pit gold mine


In 2010, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold (377,000 attributable ounces). It reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves on December 31, 2010.
New Zealand[edit]
Newmont acquired its Waihi assets as part of the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002. The Waihi operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves at the end of the year.
Martha. The Martha Mine operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. The open pit mine has operated over historic underground gold mine workings since 1988.
Favona. The Favona underground mine began extracting ore at the end of 2006.
Batu Hijau, Sumbawa, Indonesia[edit]




Haul trucks at the Batu Hijau open pit, 2009


Newmont operates the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa in the Indonesia in the province of West Nusa Tenggara through its subsidiary company P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara which is a joint venture between Newmont, Sumitomo Corporation and P.T. Pukuafu Indah.
Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced 542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable ounces). On December 31, 2010, it reported 3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and 3.7 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2008, the Indonesian government threatened to terminate the contract of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara after accusing it of failing to meet its divestment obligations. On April 1, 2009, international arbitrators and its partner sided with Newmont rejecting Jakarta's request to have their contract revoked, which would have forced the company to walk away from the property without any compensation. Instead Newmont was forced to sell a 17% stake in an Indonesian subsidiary within 180 days.[19]
In 2011, subsidiaries of Newmont and Sumitomo Corporation divested a 7 percent investment in PTNNT. Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), designated as the buyer by the Indonesian Government, signed a sale and purchase agreement for the shares worth $246.8 million. Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V., which holds Newmont’s shares in PTNNT – together with shares held by a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan – now owns 49 percent of PTNNT. Of that amount, Newmont will directly own 27.56 percent of PTNNT and has another 17 percent economic interest through financing arrangements with existing shareholders.[20]
Ghana[edit]
The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Newmont operates four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010.
Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010, reported 10.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Additionally, Newmont’s Akyem Mine (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In January 2010, Newmont received the mining lease. After close to two years of construction, the Akyem mine commenced commercial production in late 2013.
At December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves.
Other operations[edit]
Mexico[edit]
Newmont has a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura produced 174,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, it had 2.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Former operations[edit]
Newmont has purchased and sold a number of operations in recent years:

Golden Grove Mine: Owned by Normandy Mining Limited since 1991, Golden Grove was acquired by Newmont Australia Ltd in February 2002 when Newmont took over Normandy.[21] Newmont sold on the mine to Oxiana Limited in June 2005 for A$265 million.[22]
Pajingo: Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Townsville, Queensland and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. Newmont sold the mine in late 2007; it is now owned by Conquest Mining.
Bronzewing Gold Mine: View Resources purchased the mine in July 2004 from Newmont for A$9.0 million, a package that also included the McClure mining operation, 8 km west of Bronzewing.[23]
Wiluna Gold Mine: Also part of the Normandy acquisition, Gowit Limited, later Agincourt Resources, purchased the mine on 10 December 2003 from Newmont for shares and $3.65 million in cash.[24][25]
Zarafshan: Newmont was part of a joint venture gold project in Uzbekistan, the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A difficult place to operate, Uzbekistan expropriates the company’s assets in 2006.
Kori Kollo: The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont had an 88% interest. The remaining 12% was owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owned and operated the mine. On July 23, 2009, Newmont announced the transfer of its interest in Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., which owned the Kori Kollo gold mine and Kori Chaca gold mine, to Compania Procesadora de Minerales S.A. ("CPM"), a company controlled by Newmont's long-time Bolivian partner Jose Mercado.
Minahasa: Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004.
Golden Giant: Newmont's Canadian operations previously included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) was located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon, Ontario, Canada, and had been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout most of 2006.
Holloway: Holloway was located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson, Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant. It was in production since 1996. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.
Empire-Star: Located in Grass Valley, California, the mine has been closed since 1957

Controversies[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (January 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Nevada operations[edit]
In July 2009, the Mine Safety and Health Administration announced that four supervisors for the Denver-based mining company have agreed to pay a combined $60,000 in individual penalties for their role in the accident at the Midas Mine north of Elko in June 2007. The agency said managers "showed a disregard for the miners' welfare" and acted with "more than ordinary negligence" before the victim fell through a sinkhole while operating a large loader about 200 feet below the entrance of the mine." [26]
State tax deductions[edit]
In March 2011, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval replaced his director of taxation, citing problems in auditing tax deductions.[27] Statements by both Nevada Mining Association President Tim Crowley[28] and Republican Assembly Minority Floor Leader Pete Goicoechea of Eureka County in Nevada (the county where a majority of Newmont's Nevada operations are located)[29] made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper.[30] This prompted the state legislature to call for "emergency regulations" to disallow some tax deductions.[31]
In April 2011, it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions, which had been approved by the Nevada Tax Commission.[30] The outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years.[27] This is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees, such as Robert J Miller, who served a director of Newmont Mining Corporation right after being Governor of Nevada for a decade.[30][not in citation given] Miller was succeeded by the late Kenny Guinn, who proposed a tax restructuring during the 2003 legislative session that was met with opposition from anti-tax business groups and many anti-tax Republicans.[citation needed]
FIN 48 an interpretation of FASB 109 requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities (or litigation).[32]
The 76th Session of the Nevada Legislature (2011), passed Senate Bill 493, over opposition from the mining industry. Senate Bill 493 "...creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, a seven-member panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation. An amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes." Some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections: "'If you don’t let us deduct this, we’ll deduct something else.'" A Newmont Mining Corp. staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction, saying employee housing cut travel costs." [27] The mines in Nevada were to report their deductions to the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, which was created under S.B. 493.[citation needed]
Batu Hijau mine, Indonesia[edit]
On 6 August 2010, a 5 day long strike, which had completely shut US-based Newmont Mining Corp.’s Batu Hijau mines and operations on Sumbawa Island ended after some 1,500 miners of the PT NNT labour union, affiliated to the Chemical, Energy, Mine Workers’ Union of the Indonesia Workers’ Union, agreed to await an overtime pay judgment from a provincial government. "The dispute started some three weeks after the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry of West Nusa Tenggara Province issued an order that management was in arrears on Rp 126 billion (US$13.8 million) in overtime wages to some 1,919 workers dating back to 2008." [33]

Yanacocha mine, Peru[edit]




The "Minera Yanacocha" gold mine near Cajamarca (Peru)


The Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru is considered one of the largest and most profitable in the world, producing over US$7 billion worth of gold to date. Before 1994 the mine was co-owned by Newmont, Buenaventura (a Peruvian mining company), and Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), a French government-owned company. This partnership collapsed in 1994 after BRGM tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an Australian company which was a rival of Newmont. Newmont and Buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade.
Larry Kurlander, then a senior executive at Newmont, claimed the French President Jacques Chirac had sent a letter to then Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the French owned company. Kurlander had been sent by Newmont to Peru to try to get a favorable outcome for Newmont in the dispute. The legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the Peruvian Supreme Court.
During this period Kurlander acknowledges having met with Vladimiro Montesinos, the Peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement, illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, influence peddling and bribing TV stations. [4] [5] However, Kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the French government were taking similar steps in trying to contact Montesinos. The French ambassador to Peru Antoine Blanca denies this, pointing to the fact that Montesinos was on the CIA payroll and thus would naturally side with the U.S-based company.
After the fall of Fujimori in 2000 a number of videos Montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged. In October 2005 Frontline in co-production with The New York Times found a February 1998 recording of a telephone conversation between Montesinos and Kurlander. The following is an excerpt from the tape:

Kurlander:...we have a very serious problem in Peru with our company (Newmont) and Minera Buenaventura so I have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities. I need it especially because the other side (the French government) has been acting quite strangely.


Montesinos (to interpreter): Tell him that I am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the French, as well as the problem he has with the judiciary.


Kurlander: So now you have a friend for life. I want a friend for life.


Montesinos (to interpreter): I thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend. Tell him I'm going to help him with the voting. I would like to know the tricky practices of the French. The French Connection!


Kurlander: The French Connection!


(laughter) [34]

Along with this telephone conversation, Frontline and The New York Times also re-broadcast three other videos. One was filmed in April 1998 and shows Montesinos talking to "Don Arabian", the CIA station chief in Peru, in an attempt to get CIA to pressure the U.S. to back Newmont in the case. In the video Montesinos claims to have found e-mails from Paris to Peru of French officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to France.
Another video recorded in May 1998 shows Montesinos meeting with Peruvian Supreme Court Justice, and former classmate, Jaime Beltran Quiroga. In it Montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between Newmont and BRGM. He tells Quiroga that if the decision goes to Newmont that the United States will back Peru in its border dispute with Ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the Cenepa War. He also tells Quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press. Quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case, his vote would be the deciding vote in the Newmont victory. After the video was first broadcast in Peru in 2001, on a Peruvian local television station the French Ambassador Antoine Blanca was quoted as saying "Now I know why Newmont won".
In the final July 1999 video, Montesinos is again seen with the now departing CIA station chief "Don Arabian" giving him a gift and thanking him for the help he has given Peru stating "[W]e hope that when you're back their [in Washington] you'll remember your friends".
Buyat Bay, Sulawesi, Indonesia[edit]
In August 2004, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment filed a US$133.6 million civil lawsuit against Newmont,[35] claiming tailings from the company's Minahasa Raya mine polluted Buyat Bay in the North Sulawesi province, contaminating local fish stocks and causing nearby villagers to become seriously ill. Newmont denied the allegations, arguing that the illnesses had more to do with poor hygiene and poverty. On November 15, 2005, a South Jakarta court dismissed the suit on technical grounds, saying the government had breached the terms of its contract with Newmont when it took legal action before seeking arbitration. Environmentalists urged for the suit to be appealed, but on December 1, 2005, Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar said the government expected to reach an out-of-court settlement with Newmont's local subsidiary. "By negotiating a settlement, we hope to be able to quickly compensate people living near the mine," he said. The government negotiating team was led by chief Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie. On February 16, 2006, the Indonesian government announced it would settle the civil suit for US$30 million to be paid over the next 10 years. The agreement also includes increased scientific monitoring and enhanced community development programs for the North Sulawesi province.
With the civil lawsuit settled, attention focused on the criminal charges against President Director Richard Ness. In December 2006, Newmont Mining Corp. objected to a documentary entitled Bye Bye Buyat being nominated for Indonesia's top film award, FFI's Citra Award. The company said that it interfered with Ness' ongoing trial.[36]
After a 21-month trial—one of the longest proceedings in Indonesian history—Ness was found innocent of the pollution charges on April 24, 2007.[37] The court found that the company was in compliance with all regulations and permits during its operations at the site, and failed to find evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Nemont's subsidiary had polluted Buyat Bay. At the end of May, the prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.[37]
A week after being found not guilty of criminal charges, Richard Ness sued The New York Times in Indonesian court for libel. The lawsuit asks for nearly US$65 million in damages, and that The New York Times print a page-one retraction of previously published articles.[38] In October 2007 an Indonesian court threw out the suit stating it was not within their jurisdiction. The case was being appealed.[39]
Akyem, Ghana[edit]
Newmont received the 2009 Public Eye award for its Akyem project in Ghana. According to the jury it had destroyed unique natural habitats, carried out forced resettlement of local people and polluted soil and rivers.[40] Newmont described the information as misleading and said the project had been extensively studied by international and national environmental experts, members of the local communities, and by the appropriate governmental agencies and departments.[41]
In January 2010, Ghanaian authorities brought a lawsuit against Newmont Mining for a reported US$4.9 million.[42]. The lawsuit accused Newmont of negligently spilling cyanide at its Ahafo gold mine in October 2009, resulting in water contamination and fish kills.[43] Newmont disputed the accusation, but agreed in March 2010 to pay compensation "in accordance with the law".[44]

History[edit]




William Boyce Thompson, founder of Newmont Mining


Early years[edit]
Newmont Mining Corporation was founded in 1916 in New York by Colonel William Boyce Thompson as a holding company to invest in Worldwide mineral, oil, and related companies. According to company lore, the name "Newmont" is a portmanteau "New York" and "Montana", reflecting where Thompson made his fortune and where he grew up.[6]
In 1929, Newmont became a mining company with its first gold product in by acquiring California's Empire Star Mine. By 1939, Newmont was operating 12 gold mines in North America.
The company acquired interests overseas. For decades around the middle of the 20th century, Newmont had a controlling interest in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia and in the O'Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand, South Africa.
Beginning in 1925, Newmont acquired interests in a Texas oil field. Eventually, Newmont's oil interests included more than 70 blocks in the Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico area and oil and gas production in the North Sea.
Newmont discovered the world's first submicroscopic or "invisible" gold at Carlin, Nevada in the early 1960s and began production on the first open pit gold mine in the world. The "Carlin Trend" or "Carlin Unconformity" is the largest gold discovery in North America during the 20th century. In 1971 Newmont began using the heap leaching technology on sub-mill grade ores there.
In the 1980s, Newmont thwarted five takeover bids – from Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold), T. Boone Pickens, Minorco, Hanson Industries and Sir James Goldsmith – who sought to break Newmont apart and sell its assets to increase shareholder value.
Major growth[edit]
After 1987, the company undertook major restructuring. This included the payment of a US$33 per share dividend to all shareholders for a total of US$2.2 billion, of which US$1.75 billion was borrowed. To reduce this debt the company undertook a divestment program involving all of its copper, oil, gas, and coal interests.
As a further step in the restructuring, the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Denver in 1988. A decade later, Newmont Mining Corporation and Newmont Gold Company combined assets to form a unified worldwide gold company. Shareholders of both companies had identical interests in the reserves, production and earnings of Newmont Gold's operations.
Newmont then merged with Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation (a former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway subsidiary, sold in preparation for the merger that produced the BNSF Railway[7]) to form North America's largest gold producer.
On June 21, 2000, Newmont announced a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. The merger was completed in January 2001.
In February 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Normandy Mining Limited and Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited. Newmont faced competition in its bid for Normandy from AngloGold. By eventually outbiding the South African company, Newmont became the world's largest gold producer, with an annual production in excess of 8 million ounces.[8]
In 2007, the company eliminated its 1.5 million ounce legacy hedge book to make Newmont the world’s largest unhedged gold producer. The following year, Newmont acquired Miramar Mining Corporation and its Hope Bay deposit in the Canadian Arctic.
In late 2008, Newmont moved its headquarters from Denver to the suburb of Greenwood Village, Colorado.[9]
In 2009, Newmont purchased the remaining one-third interest in Boddington Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti, bringing its ownership to 100 percent.
In April 2011, the company acquired Canada's Fronteer Gold Inc. for Cdn $2.3 billion. This made the company the world's second-largest gold producer.[10]
Operations and major projects[edit]




Gold Quarry mine, near Carlin, Nevada, 2009.


Nevada[edit]
As of 2011, Newmont’s Nevada 14 open-pit and four underground operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend; the Phoenix gold/copper mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of Golconda; and the Midas mine, near the town of the same name. It also participates in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
With the acquisition of Fronteer Gold, over sixty additional projects were added to the Newmont portfolio. The flagship property, Long Canyon, is located on a gold trend that is similar to the Carlin Trend in terms of its characteristics and potential.
Colorado[edit]
In August 2015, Newmont purchased the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti. The mine is the largest gold and silver producer in the state of Colorado.[11]
Yanacocha, Peru[edit]
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interest held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha’s mining rights consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines: Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. In addition, reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San Jose and Maqui Maqui are currently underway.
Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million ounces (750,000 attributable ounces). As of December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2011, Newmont’s board of directors granted approval to develop the Conga Project, located in the provinces of Celendín, and Sorochuco Huasmín districts and Cajamarca district of Encañada. Newmont’s ownership interest is identical to Yanacocha. If all permits are secured, the commencement of production is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.[12]
In 2015, agents acting on behalf of Newmont Mining Corporation attacked and beat a woman who refused to move from her home to allow for the development of a mine.

Australia[edit]
Newmont acquired its Australian assets with the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002.[17][18]
Boddington. Newmont’s newest Australian asset is Boddington, which is now Australia's largest gold producer. It has been wholly owned since June 2009, when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010. As of year-end 2010, it reported 20.3 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves.
Tanami. The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites.
The Tanami operations have been wholly owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests. Operations today are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold. As of December 31, 2010, it had a reported 2.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest.




The Super Pit gold mine


In 2010, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold (377,000 attributable ounces). It reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves on December 31, 2010.
New Zealand[edit]
Newmont acquired its Waihi assets as part of the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002. The Waihi operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves at the end of the year.
Martha. The Martha Mine operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. The open pit mine has operated over historic underground gold mine workings since 1988.
Favona. The Favona underground mine began extracting ore at the end of 2006.
Batu Hijau, Sumbawa, Indonesia[edit]

Newmont operates the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa in the Indonesia in the province of West Nusa Tenggara through its subsidiary company P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara which is a joint venture between Newmont, Sumitomo Corporation and P.T. Pukuafu Indah.
Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced 542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable ounces). On December 31, 2010, it reported 3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and 3.7 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2008, the Indonesian government threatened to terminate the contract of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara after accusing it of failing to meet its divestment obligations. On April 1, 2009, international arbitrators and its partner sided with Newmont rejecting Jakarta's request to have their contract revoked, which would have forced the company to walk away from the property without any compensation. Instead Newmont was forced to sell a 17% stake in an Indonesian subsidiary within 180 days.[19]
In 2011, subsidiaries of Newmont and Sumitomo Corporation divested a 7 percent investment in PTNNT. Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), designated as the buyer by the Indonesian Government, signed a sale and purchase agreement for the shares worth $246.8 million. Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V., which holds Newmont’s shares in PTNNT – together with shares held by a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan – now owns 49 percent of PTNNT. Of that amount, Newmont will directly own 27.56 percent of PTNNT and has another 17 percent economic interest through financing arrangements with existing shareholders.[20]
Ghana[edit]
The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Newmont operates four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010.
Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010, reported 10.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Additionally, Newmont’s Akyem Mine (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In January 2010, Newmont received the mining lease. After close to two years of construction, the Akyem mine commenced commercial production in late 2013.
At December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves.
Other operations[edit]
Mexico[edit]
Newmont has a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura produced 174,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, it had 2.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Former operations[edit]
Newmont has purchased and sold a number of operations in recent years:

Golden Grove Mine: Owned by Normandy Mining Limited since 1991, Golden Grove was acquired by Newmont Australia Ltd in February 2002 when Newmont took over Normandy.[21] Newmont sold on the mine to Oxiana Limited in June 2005 for A$265 million.[22]
Pajingo: Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Townsville, Queensland and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. Newmont sold the mine in late 2007; it is now owned by Conquest Mining.
Bronzewing Gold Mine: View Resources purchased the mine in July 2004 from Newmont for A$9.0 million, a package that also included the McClure mining operation, 8 km west of Bronzewing.[23]
Wiluna Gold Mine: Also part of the Normandy acquisition, Gowit Limited, later Agincourt Resources, purchased the mine on 10 December 2003 from Newmont for shares and $3.65 million in cash.[24][25]
Zarafshan: Newmont was part of a joint venture gold project in Uzbekistan, the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A difficult place to operate, Uzbekistan expropriates the company’s assets in 2006.
Kori Kollo: The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont had an 88% interest. The remaining 12% was owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owned and operated the mine. On July 23, 2009, Newmont announced the transfer of its interest in Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., which owned the Kori Kollo gold mine and Kori Chaca gold mine, to Compania Procesadora de Minerales S.A. ("CPM"), a company controlled by Newmont's long-time Bolivian partner Jose Mercado.
Minahasa: Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004.
Golden Giant: Newmont's Canadian operations previously included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) was located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon, Ontario, Canada, and had been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout most of 2006.
Holloway: Holloway was located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson, Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant. It was in production since 1996. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.
Empire-Star: Located in Grass Valley, California, the mine has been closed since 1957

Controversies[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (January 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Nevada operations[edit]
In July 2009, the Mine Safety and Health Administration announced that four supervisors for the Denver-based mining company have agreed to pay a combined $60,000 in individual penalties for their role in the accident at the Midas Mine north of Elko in June 2007. The agency said managers "showed a disregard for the miners' welfare" and acted with "more than ordinary negligence" before the victim fell through a sinkhole while operating a large loader about 200 feet below the entrance of the mine." [26]
State tax deductions[edit]
In March 2011, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval replaced his director of taxation, citing problems in auditing tax deductions.[27] Statements by both Nevada Mining Association President Tim Crowley[28] and Republican Assembly Minority Floor Leader Pete Goicoechea of Eureka County in Nevada (the county where a majority of Newmont's Nevada operations are located)[29] made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper.[30] This prompted the state legislature to call for "emergency regulations" to disallow some tax deductions.[31]
In April 2011, it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions, which had been approved by the Nevada Tax Commission.[30] The outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years.[27] This is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees, such as Robert J Miller, who served a director of Newmont Mining Corporation right after being Governor of Nevada for a decade.[30][not in citation given] Miller was succeeded by the late Kenny Guinn, who proposed a tax restructuring during the 2003 legislative session that was met with opposition from anti-tax business groups and many anti-tax Republicans.[citation needed]
FIN 48 an interpretation of FASB 109 requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities (or litigation).[32]
The 76th Session of the Nevada Legislature (2011), passed Senate Bill 493, over opposition from the mining industry. Senate Bill 493 "...creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, a seven-member panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation. An amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes." Some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections: "'If you don’t let us deduct this, we’ll deduct something else.'" A Newmont Mining Corp. staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction, saying employee housing cut travel costs." [27] The mines in Nevada were to report their deductions to the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, which was created under S.B. 493.[citation needed]
Batu Hijau mine, Indonesia[edit]
On 6 August 2010, a 5 day long strike, which had completely shut US-based Newmont Mining Corp.’s Batu Hijau mines and operations on Sumbawa Island ended after some 1,500 miners of the PT NNT labour union, affiliated to the Chemical, Energy, Mine Workers’ Union of the Indonesia Workers’ Union, agreed to await an overtime pay judgment from a provincial government. "The dispute started some three weeks after the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry of West Nusa Tenggara Province issued an order that management was in arrears on Rp 126 billion (US$13.8 million) in overtime wages to some 1,919 workers dating back to 2008." [33]

Yanacocha mine, Peru[edit]




The "Minera Yanacocha" gold mine near Cajamarca (Peru)


The Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru is considered one of the largest and most profitable in the world, producing over US$7 billion worth of gold to date. Before 1994 the mine was co-owned by Newmont, Buenaventura (a Peruvian mining company), and Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), a French government-owned company. This partnership collapsed in 1994 after BRGM tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an Australian company which was a rival of Newmont. Newmont and Buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade.
Larry Kurlander, then a senior executive at Newmont, claimed the French President Jacques Chirac had sent a letter to then Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the French owned company. Kurlander had been sent by Newmont to Peru to try to get a favorable outcome for Newmont in the dispute. The legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the Peruvian Supreme Court.
During this period Kurlander acknowledges having met with Vladimiro Montesinos, the Peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement, illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, influence peddling and bribing TV stations. [4] [5] However, Kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the French government were taking similar steps in trying to contact Montesinos. The French ambassador to Peru Antoine Blanca denies this, pointing to the fact that Montesinos was on the CIA payroll and thus would naturally side with the U.S-based company.
After the fall of Fujimori in 2000 a number of videos Montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged. In October 2005 Frontline in co-production with The New York Times found a February 1998 recording of a telephone conversation between Montesinos and Kurlander. The following is an excerpt from the tape:

Kurlander:...we have a very serious problem in Peru with our company (Newmont) and Minera Buenaventura so I have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities. I need it especially because the other side (the French government) has been acting quite strangely.


Montesinos (to interpreter): Tell him that I am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the French, as well as the problem he has with the judiciary.


Kurlander: So now you have a friend for life. I want a friend for life.


Montesinos (to interpreter): I thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend. Tell him I'm going to help him with the voting. I would like to know the tricky practices of the French. The French Connection!


Kurlander: The French Connection!


(laughter) [34]

Along with this telephone conversation, Frontline and The New York Times also re-broadcast three other videos. One was filmed in April 1998 and shows Montesinos talking to "Don Arabian", the CIA station chief in Peru, in an attempt to get CIA to pressure the U.S. to back Newmont in the case. In the video Montesinos claims to have found e-mails from Paris to Peru of French officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to France.
Another video recorded in May 1998 shows Montesinos meeting with Peruvian Supreme Court Justice, and former classmate, Jaime Beltran Quiroga. In it Montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between Newmont and BRGM. He tells Quiroga that if the decision goes to Newmont that the United States will back Peru in its border dispute with Ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the Cenepa War. He also tells Quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press. Quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case, his vote would be the deciding vote in the Newmont victory. After the video was first broadcast in Peru in 2001, on a Peruvian local television station the French Ambassador Antoine Blanca was quoted as saying "Now I know why Newmont won".
In the final July 1999 video, Montesinos is again seen with the now departing CIA station chief "Don Arabian" giving him a gift and thanking him for the help he has given Peru stating "[W]e hope that when you're back their [in Washington] you'll remember your friends".
Buyat Bay, Sulawesi, Indonesia[edit]
In August 2004, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment filed a US$133.6 million civil lawsuit against Newmont,[35] claiming tailings from the company's Minahasa Raya mine polluted Buyat Bay in the North Sulawesi province, contaminating local fish stocks and causing nearby villagers to become seriously ill. Newmont denied the allegations, arguing that the illnesses had more to do with poor hygiene and poverty. On November 15, 2005, a South Jakarta court dismissed the suit on technical grounds, saying the government had breached the terms of its contract with Newmont when it took legal action before seeking arbitration. Environmentalists urged for the suit to be appealed, but on December 1, 2005, Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar said the government expected to reach an out-of-court settlement with Newmont's local subsidiary. "By negotiating a settlement, we hope to be able to quickly compensate people living near the mine," he said. The government negotiating team was led by chief Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie. On February 16, 2006, the Indonesian government announced it would settle the civil suit for US$30 million to be paid over the next 10 years. The agreement also includes increased scientific monitoring and enhanced community development programs for the North Sulawesi province.
With the civil lawsuit settled, attention focused on the criminal charges against President Director Richard Ness. In December 2006, Newmont Mining Corp. objected to a documentary entitled Bye Bye Buyat being nominated for Indonesia's top film award, FFI's Citra Award. The company said that it interfered with Ness' ongoing trial.[36]
After a 21-month trial—one of the longest proceedings in Indonesian history—Ness was found innocent of the pollution charges on April 24, 2007.[37] The court found that the company was in compliance with all regulations and permits during its operations at the site, and failed to find evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Nemont's subsidiary had polluted Buyat Bay. At the end of May, the prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.[37]
A week after being found not guilty of criminal charges, Richard Ness sued The New York Times in Indonesian court for libel. The lawsuit asks for nearly US$65 million in damages, and that The New York Times print a page-one retraction of previously published articles.[38] In October 2007 an Indonesian court threw out the suit stating it was not within their jurisdiction. The case was being appealed.[39]
Akyem, Ghana[edit]
Newmont received the 2009 Public Eye award for its Akyem project in Ghana. According to the jury it had destroyed unique natural habitats, carried out forced resettlement of local people and polluted soil and rivers.[40] Newmont described the information as misleading and said the project had been extensively studied by international and national environmental experts, members of the local communities, and by the appropriate governmental agencies and departments.[41]
In January 2010, Ghanaian authorities brought a lawsuit against Newmont Mining for a reported US$4.9 million.[42]. The lawsuit accused Newmont of negligently spilling cyanide at its Ahafo gold mine in October 2009, resulting in water contamination and fish kills.[43] Newmont disputed the accusation, but agreed in March 2010 to pay compensation "in accordance with the law".[44]

History[edit]




William Boyce Thompson, founder of Newmont Mining


Early years[edit]
Newmont Mining Corporation was founded in 1916 in New York by Colonel William Boyce Thompson as a holding company to invest in Worldwide mineral, oil, and related companies. According to company lore, the name "Newmont" is a portmanteau "New York" and "Montana", reflecting where Thompson made his fortune and where he grew up.[6]
In 1929, Newmont became a mining company with its first gold product in by acquiring California's Empire Star Mine. By 1939, Newmont was operating 12 gold mines in North America.
The company acquired interests overseas. For decades around the middle of the 20th century, Newmont had a controlling interest in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia and in the O'Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand, South Africa.
Beginning in 1925, Newmont acquired interests in a Texas oil field. Eventually, Newmont's oil interests included more than 70 blocks in the Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico area and oil and gas production in the North Sea.
Newmont discovered the world's first submicroscopic or "invisible" gold at Carlin, Nevada in the early 1960s and began production on the first open pit gold mine in the world. The "Carlin Trend" or "Carlin Unconformity" is the largest gold discovery in North America during the 20th century. In 1971 Newmont began using the heap leaching technology on sub-mill grade ores there.
In the 1980s, Newmont thwarted five takeover bids – from Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold), T. Boone Pickens, Minorco, Hanson Industries and Sir James Goldsmith – who sought to break Newmont apart and sell its assets to increase shareholder value.
Major growth[edit]
After 1987, the company undertook major restructuring. This included the payment of a US$33 per share dividend to all shareholders for a total of US$2.2 billion, of which US$1.75 billion was borrowed. To reduce this debt the company undertook a divestment program involving all of its copper, oil, gas, and coal interests.
As a further step in the restructuring, the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Denver in 1988. A decade later, Newmont Mining Corporation and Newmont Gold Company combined assets to form a unified worldwide gold company. Shareholders of both companies had identical interests in the reserves, production and earnings of Newmont Gold's operations.
Newmont then merged with Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation (a former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway subsidiary, sold in preparation for the merger that produced the BNSF Railway[7]) to form North America's largest gold producer.
On June 21, 2000, Newmont announced a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. The merger was completed in January 2001.
In February 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Normandy Mining Limited and Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited. Newmont faced competition in its bid for Normandy from AngloGold. By eventually outbiding the South African company, Newmont became the world's largest gold producer, with an annual production in excess of 8 million ounces.[8]
In 2007, the company eliminated its 1.5 million ounce legacy hedge book to make Newmont the world’s largest unhedged gold producer. The following year, Newmont acquired Miramar Mining Corporation and its Hope Bay deposit in the Canadian Arctic.
In late 2008, Newmont moved its headquarters from Denver to the suburb of Greenwood Village, Colorado.[9]
In 2009, Newmont purchased the remaining one-third interest in Boddington Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti, bringing its ownership to 100 percent.
In April 2011, the company acquired Canada's Fronteer Gold Inc. for Cdn $2.3 billion. This made the company the world's second-largest gold producer.[10]
Operations and major projects[edit]

Nevada[edit]
As of 2011, Newmont’s Nevada 14 open-pit and four underground operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend; the Phoenix gold/copper mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of Golconda; and the Midas mine, near the town of the same name. It also participates in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
With the acquisition of Fronteer Gold, over sixty additional projects were added to the Newmont portfolio. The flagship property, Long Canyon, is located on a gold trend that is similar to the Carlin Trend in terms of its characteristics and potential.
Colorado[edit]
In August 2015, Newmont purchased the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti. The mine is the largest gold and silver producer in the state of Colorado.[11]
Yanacocha, Peru[edit]
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interest held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha’s mining rights consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines: Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. In addition, reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San Jose and Maqui Maqui are currently underway.
Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million ounces (750,000 attributable ounces). As of December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2011, Newmont’s board of directors granted approval to develop the Conga Project, located in the provinces of Celendín, and Sorochuco Huasmín districts and Cajamarca district of Encañada. Newmont’s ownership interest is identical to Yanacocha. If all permits are secured, the commencement of production is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.[12]
In 2015, agents acting on behalf of Newmont Mining Corporation attacked and beat a woman who refused to move from her home to allow for the development of a mine.
Indigenous Peruvian farmworker Maxima Acuña de Chaupe withstood violent eviction attempts, beatings, and a legal battle to protect her land from being turned into an open-pit gold mine[13]

Australia[edit]
Newmont acquired its Australian assets with the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002.[17][18]
Boddington. Newmont’s newest Australian asset is Boddington, which is now Australia's largest gold producer. It has been wholly owned since June 2009, when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010. As of year-end 2010, it reported 20.3 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves.
Tanami. The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites.
The Tanami operations have been wholly owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests. Operations today are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold. As of December 31, 2010, it had a reported 2.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest.




The Super Pit gold mine


In 2010, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold (377,000 attributable ounces). It reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves on December 31, 2010.
New Zealand[edit]
Newmont acquired its Waihi assets as part of the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002. The Waihi operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves at the end of the year.
Martha. The Martha Mine operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. The open pit mine has operated over historic underground gold mine workings since 1988.
Favona. The Favona underground mine began extracting ore at the end of 2006.
Batu Hijau, Sumbawa, Indonesia[edit]




Haul trucks at the Batu Hijau open pit, 2009


Newmont operates the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa in the Indonesia in the province of West Nusa Tenggara through its subsidiary company P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara which is a joint venture between Newmont, Sumitomo Corporation and P.T. Pukuafu Indah.
Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced 542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable ounces). On December 31, 2010, it reported 3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and 3.7 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2008, the Indonesian government threatened to terminate the contract of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara after accusing it of failing to meet its divestment obligations. On April 1, 2009, international arbitrators and its partner sided with Newmont rejecting Jakarta's request to have their contract revoked, which would have forced the company to walk away from the property without any compensation. Instead Newmont was forced to sell a 17% stake in an Indonesian subsidiary within 180 days.[19]
In 2011, subsidiaries of Newmont and Sumitomo Corporation divested a 7 percent investment in PTNNT. Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), designated as the buyer by the Indonesian Government, signed a sale and purchase agreement for the shares worth $246.8 million. Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V., which holds Newmont’s shares in PTNNT – together with shares held by a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan – now owns 49 percent of PTNNT. Of that amount, Newmont will directly own 27.56 percent of PTNNT and has another 17 percent economic interest through financing arrangements with existing shareholders.[20]
Ghana[edit]
The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Newmont operates four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010.
Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010, reported 10.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Additionally, Newmont’s Akyem Mine (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In January 2010, Newmont received the mining lease. After close to two years of construction, the Akyem mine commenced commercial production in late 2013.
At December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves.
Other operations[edit]
Mexico[edit]
Newmont has a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura produced 174,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, it had 2.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Former operations[edit]
Newmont has purchased and sold a number of operations in recent years:

Golden Grove Mine: Owned by Normandy Mining Limited since 1991, Golden Grove was acquired by Newmont Australia Ltd in February 2002 when Newmont took over Normandy.[21] Newmont sold on the mine to Oxiana Limited in June 2005 for A$265 million.[22]
Pajingo: Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Townsville, Queensland and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. Newmont sold the mine in late 2007; it is now owned by Conquest Mining.
Bronzewing Gold Mine: View Resources purchased the mine in July 2004 from Newmont for A$9.0 million, a package that also included the McClure mining operation, 8 km west of Bronzewing.[23]
Wiluna Gold Mine: Also part of the Normandy acquisition, Gowit Limited, later Agincourt Resources, purchased the mine on 10 December 2003 from Newmont for shares and $3.65 million in cash.[24][25]
Zarafshan: Newmont was part of a joint venture gold project in Uzbekistan, the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A difficult place to operate, Uzbekistan expropriates the company’s assets in 2006.
Kori Kollo: The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont had an 88% interest. The remaining 12% was owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owned and operated the mine. On July 23, 2009, Newmont announced the transfer of its interest in Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., which owned the Kori Kollo gold mine and Kori Chaca gold mine, to Compania Procesadora de Minerales S.A. ("CPM"), a company controlled by Newmont's long-time Bolivian partner Jose Mercado.
Minahasa: Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004.
Golden Giant: Newmont's Canadian operations previously included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) was located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon, Ontario, Canada, and had been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout most of 2006.
Holloway: Holloway was located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson, Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant. It was in production since 1996. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.
Empire-Star: Located in Grass Valley, California, the mine has been closed since 1957

Controversies[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (January 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Nevada operations[edit]
In July 2009, the Mine Safety and Health Administration announced that four supervisors for the Denver-based mining company have agreed to pay a combined $60,000 in individual penalties for their role in the accident at the Midas Mine north of Elko in June 2007. The agency said managers "showed a disregard for the miners' welfare" and acted with "more than ordinary negligence" before the victim fell through a sinkhole while operating a large loader about 200 feet below the entrance of the mine." [26]
State tax deductions[edit]
In March 2011, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval replaced his director of taxation, citing problems in auditing tax deductions.[27] Statements by both Nevada Mining Association President Tim Crowley[28] and Republican Assembly Minority Floor Leader Pete Goicoechea of Eureka County in Nevada (the county where a majority of Newmont's Nevada operations are located)[29] made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper.[30] This prompted the state legislature to call for "emergency regulations" to disallow some tax deductions.[31]
In April 2011, it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions, which had been approved by the Nevada Tax Commission.[30] The outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years.[27] This is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees, such as Robert J Miller, who served a director of Newmont Mining Corporation right after being Governor of Nevada for a decade.[30][not in citation given] Miller was succeeded by the late Kenny Guinn, who proposed a tax restructuring during the 2003 legislative session that was met with opposition from anti-tax business groups and many anti-tax Republicans.[citation needed]
FIN 48 an interpretation of FASB 109 requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities (or litigation).[32]
The 76th Session of the Nevada Legislature (2011), passed Senate Bill 493, over opposition from the mining industry. Senate Bill 493 "...creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, a seven-member panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation. An amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes." Some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections: "'If you don’t let us deduct this, we’ll deduct something else.'" A Newmont Mining Corp. staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction, saying employee housing cut travel costs." [27] The mines in Nevada were to report their deductions to the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, which was created under S.B. 493.[citation needed]
Batu Hijau mine, Indonesia[edit]
On 6 August 2010, a 5 day long strike, which had completely shut US-based Newmont Mining Corp.’s Batu Hijau mines and operations on Sumbawa Island ended after some 1,500 miners of the PT NNT labour union, affiliated to the Chemical, Energy, Mine Workers’ Union of the Indonesia Workers’ Union, agreed to await an overtime pay judgment from a provincial government. "The dispute started some three weeks after the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry of West Nusa Tenggara Province issued an order that management was in arrears on Rp 126 billion (US$13.8 million) in overtime wages to some 1,919 workers dating back to 2008." [33]

Yanacocha mine, Peru[edit]




The "Minera Yanacocha" gold mine near Cajamarca (Peru)


The Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru is considered one of the largest and most profitable in the world, producing over US$7 billion worth of gold to date. Before 1994 the mine was co-owned by Newmont, Buenaventura (a Peruvian mining company), and Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), a French government-owned company. This partnership collapsed in 1994 after BRGM tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an Australian company which was a rival of Newmont. Newmont and Buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade.
Larry Kurlander, then a senior executive at Newmont, claimed the French President Jacques Chirac had sent a letter to then Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the French owned company. Kurlander had been sent by Newmont to Peru to try to get a favorable outcome for Newmont in the dispute. The legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the Peruvian Supreme Court.
During this period Kurlander acknowledges having met with Vladimiro Montesinos, the Peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement, illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, influence peddling and bribing TV stations. [4] [5] However, Kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the French government were taking similar steps in trying to contact Montesinos. The French ambassador to Peru Antoine Blanca denies this, pointing to the fact that Montesinos was on the CIA payroll and thus would naturally side with the U.S-based company.
After the fall of Fujimori in 2000 a number of videos Montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged. In October 2005 Frontline in co-production with The New York Times found a February 1998 recording of a telephone conversation between Montesinos and Kurlander. The following is an excerpt from the tape:

Kurlander:...we have a very serious problem in Peru with our company (Newmont) and Minera Buenaventura so I have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities. I need it especially because the other side (the French government) has been acting quite strangely.


Montesinos (to interpreter): Tell him that I am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the French, as well as the problem he has with the judiciary.


Kurlander: So now you have a friend for life. I want a friend for life.


Montesinos (to interpreter): I thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend. Tell him I'm going to help him with the voting. I would like to know the tricky practices of the French. The French Connection!


Kurlander: The French Connection!


(laughter) [34]

Along with this telephone conversation, Frontline and The New York Times also re-broadcast three other videos. One was filmed in April 1998 and shows Montesinos talking to "Don Arabian", the CIA station chief in Peru, in an attempt to get CIA to pressure the U.S. to back Newmont in the case. In the video Montesinos claims to have found e-mails from Paris to Peru of French officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to France.
Another video recorded in May 1998 shows Montesinos meeting with Peruvian Supreme Court Justice, and former classmate, Jaime Beltran Quiroga. In it Montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between Newmont and BRGM. He tells Quiroga that if the decision goes to Newmont that the United States will back Peru in its border dispute with Ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the Cenepa War. He also tells Quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press. Quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case, his vote would be the deciding vote in the Newmont victory. After the video was first broadcast in Peru in 2001, on a Peruvian local television station the French Ambassador Antoine Blanca was quoted as saying "Now I know why Newmont won".
In the final July 1999 video, Montesinos is again seen with the now departing CIA station chief "Don Arabian" giving him a gift and thanking him for the help he has given Peru stating "[W]e hope that when you're back their [in Washington] you'll remember your friends".
Buyat Bay, Sulawesi, Indonesia[edit]
In August 2004, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment filed a US$133.6 million civil lawsuit against Newmont,[35] claiming tailings from the company's Minahasa Raya mine polluted Buyat Bay in the North Sulawesi province, contaminating local fish stocks and causing nearby villagers to become seriously ill. Newmont denied the allegations, arguing that the illnesses had more to do with poor hygiene and poverty. On November 15, 2005, a South Jakarta court dismissed the suit on technical grounds, saying the government had breached the terms of its contract with Newmont when it took legal action before seeking arbitration. Environmentalists urged for the suit to be appealed, but on December 1, 2005, Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar said the government expected to reach an out-of-court settlement with Newmont's local subsidiary. "By negotiating a settlement, we hope to be able to quickly compensate people living near the mine," he said. The government negotiating team was led by chief Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie. On February 16, 2006, the Indonesian government announced it would settle the civil suit for US$30 million to be paid over the next 10 years. The agreement also includes increased scientific monitoring and enhanced community development programs for the North Sulawesi province.
With the civil lawsuit settled, attention focused on the criminal charges against President Director Richard Ness. In December 2006, Newmont Mining Corp. objected to a documentary entitled Bye Bye Buyat being nominated for Indonesia's top film award, FFI's Citra Award. The company said that it interfered with Ness' ongoing trial.[36]
After a 21-month trial—one of the longest proceedings in Indonesian history—Ness was found innocent of the pollution charges on April 24, 2007.[37] The court found that the company was in compliance with all regulations and permits during its operations at the site, and failed to find evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Nemont's subsidiary had polluted Buyat Bay. At the end of May, the prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.[37]
A week after being found not guilty of criminal charges, Richard Ness sued The New York Times in Indonesian court for libel. The lawsuit asks for nearly US$65 million in damages, and that The New York Times print a page-one retraction of previously published articles.[38] In October 2007 an Indonesian court threw out the suit stating it was not within their jurisdiction. The case was being appealed.[39]
Akyem, Ghana[edit]
Newmont received the 2009 Public Eye award for its Akyem project in Ghana. According to the jury it had destroyed unique natural habitats, carried out forced resettlement of local people and polluted soil and rivers.[40] Newmont described the information as misleading and said the project had been extensively studied by international and national environmental experts, members of the local communities, and by the appropriate governmental agencies and departments.[41]
In January 2010, Ghanaian authorities brought a lawsuit against Newmont Mining for a reported US$4.9 million.[42]. The lawsuit accused Newmont of negligently spilling cyanide at its Ahafo gold mine in October 2009, resulting in water contamination and fish kills.[43] Newmont disputed the accusation, but agreed in March 2010 to pay compensation "in accordance with the law".[44]

History[edit]




William Boyce Thompson, founder of Newmont Mining


Early years[edit]
Newmont Mining Corporation was founded in 1916 in New York by Colonel William Boyce Thompson as a holding company to invest in Worldwide mineral, oil, and related companies. According to company lore, the name "Newmont" is a portmanteau "New York" and "Montana", reflecting where Thompson made his fortune and where he grew up.[6]
In 1929, Newmont became a mining company with its first gold product in by acquiring California's Empire Star Mine. By 1939, Newmont was operating 12 gold mines in North America.
The company acquired interests overseas. For decades around the middle of the 20th century, Newmont had a controlling interest in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia and in the O'Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand, South Africa.
Beginning in 1925, Newmont acquired interests in a Texas oil field. Eventually, Newmont's oil interests included more than 70 blocks in the Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico area and oil and gas production in the North Sea.
Newmont discovered the world's first submicroscopic or "invisible" gold at Carlin, Nevada in the early 1960s and began production on the first open pit gold mine in the world. The "Carlin Trend" or "Carlin Unconformity" is the largest gold discovery in North America during the 20th century. In 1971 Newmont began using the heap leaching technology on sub-mill grade ores there.
In the 1980s, Newmont thwarted five takeover bids – from Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold), T. Boone Pickens, Minorco, Hanson Industries and Sir James Goldsmith – who sought to break Newmont apart and sell its assets to increase shareholder value.
Major growth[edit]
After 1987, the company undertook major restructuring. This included the payment of a US$33 per share dividend to all shareholders for a total of US$2.2 billion, of which US$1.75 billion was borrowed. To reduce this debt the company undertook a divestment program involving all of its copper, oil, gas, and coal interests.
As a further step in the restructuring, the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Denver in 1988. A decade later, Newmont Mining Corporation and Newmont Gold Company combined assets to form a unified worldwide gold company. Shareholders of both companies had identical interests in the reserves, production and earnings of Newmont Gold's operations.
Newmont then merged with Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation (a former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway subsidiary, sold in preparation for the merger that produced the BNSF Railway[7]) to form North America's largest gold producer.
On June 21, 2000, Newmont announced a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. The merger was completed in January 2001.
In February 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Normandy Mining Limited and Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited. Newmont faced competition in its bid for Normandy from AngloGold. By eventually outbiding the South African company, Newmont became the world's largest gold producer, with an annual production in excess of 8 million ounces.[8]
In 2007, the company eliminated its 1.5 million ounce legacy hedge book to make Newmont the world’s largest unhedged gold producer. The following year, Newmont acquired Miramar Mining Corporation and its Hope Bay deposit in the Canadian Arctic.
In late 2008, Newmont moved its headquarters from Denver to the suburb of Greenwood Village, Colorado.[9]
In 2009, Newmont purchased the remaining one-third interest in Boddington Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti, bringing its ownership to 100 percent.
In April 2011, the company acquired Canada's Fronteer Gold Inc. for Cdn $2.3 billion. This made the company the world's second-largest gold producer.[10]
Operations and major projects[edit]




Gold Quarry mine, near Carlin, Nevada, 2009.


Nevada[edit]
As of 2011, Newmont’s Nevada 14 open-pit and four underground operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend; the Phoenix gold/copper mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of Golconda; and the Midas mine, near the town of the same name. It also participates in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
With the acquisition of Fronteer Gold, over sixty additional projects were added to the Newmont portfolio. The flagship property, Long Canyon, is located on a gold trend that is similar to the Carlin Trend in terms of its characteristics and potential.
Colorado[edit]
In August 2015, Newmont purchased the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti. The mine is the largest gold and silver producer in the state of Colorado.[11]
Yanacocha, Peru[edit]
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interest held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha’s mining rights consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines: Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. In addition, reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San Jose and Maqui Maqui are currently underway.
Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million ounces (750,000 attributable ounces). As of December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2011, Newmont’s board of directors granted approval to develop the Conga Project, located in the provinces of Celendín, and Sorochuco Huasmín districts and Cajamarca district of Encañada. Newmont’s ownership interest is identical to Yanacocha. If all permits are secured, the commencement of production is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.[12]
In 2015, agents acting on behalf of Newmont Mining Corporation attacked and beat a woman who refused to move from her home to allow for the development of a mine.
Indigenous Peruvian farmworker Maxima Acuña de Chaupe withstood violent eviction attempts, beatings, and a legal battle to protect her land from being turned into an open-pit gold mine[13]

Australia[edit]
Newmont acquired its Australian assets with the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002.[17][18]
Boddington. Newmont’s newest Australian asset is Boddington, which is now Australia's largest gold producer. It has been wholly owned since June 2009, when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010. As of year-end 2010, it reported 20.3 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves.
Tanami. The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites.
The Tanami operations have been wholly owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests. Operations today are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold. As of December 31, 2010, it had a reported 2.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest.




The Super Pit gold mine


In 2010, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold (377,000 attributable ounces). It reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves on December 31, 2010.
New Zealand[edit]
Newmont acquired its Waihi assets as part of the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002. The Waihi operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves at the end of the year.
Martha. The Martha Mine operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. The open pit mine has operated over historic underground gold mine workings since 1988.
Favona. The Favona underground mine began extracting ore at the end of 2006.
Batu Hijau, Sumbawa, Indonesia[edit]




Haul trucks at the Batu Hijau open pit, 2009


Newmont operates the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa in the Indonesia in the province of West Nusa Tenggara through its subsidiary company P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara which is a joint venture between Newmont, Sumitomo Corporation and P.T. Pukuafu Indah.
Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced 542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable ounces). On December 31, 2010, it reported 3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and 3.7 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2008, the Indonesian government threatened to terminate the contract of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara after accusing it of failing to meet its divestment obligations. On April 1, 2009, international arbitrators and its partner sided with Newmont rejecting Jakarta's request to have their contract revoked, which would have forced the company to walk away from the property without any compensation. Instead Newmont was forced to sell a 17% stake in an Indonesian subsidiary within 180 days.[19]
In 2011, subsidiaries of Newmont and Sumitomo Corporation divested a 7 percent investment in PTNNT. Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), designated as the buyer by the Indonesian Government, signed a sale and purchase agreement for the shares worth $246.8 million. Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V., which holds Newmont’s shares in PTNNT – together with shares held by a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan – now owns 49 percent of PTNNT. Of that amount, Newmont will directly own 27.56 percent of PTNNT and has another 17 percent economic interest through financing arrangements with existing shareholders.[20]
Ghana[edit]
The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Newmont operates four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010.
Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010, reported 10.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Additionally, Newmont’s Akyem Mine (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In January 2010, Newmont received the mining lease. After close to two years of construction, the Akyem mine commenced commercial production in late 2013.
At December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves.
Other operations[edit]
Mexico[edit]
Newmont has a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura produced 174,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, it had 2.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Former operations[edit]
Newmont has purchased and sold a number of operations in recent years:

Golden Grove Mine: Owned by Normandy Mining Limited since 1991, Golden Grove was acquired by Newmont Australia Ltd in February 2002 when Newmont took over Normandy.[21] Newmont sold on the mine to Oxiana Limited in June 2005 for A$265 million.[22]
Pajingo: Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Townsville, Queensland and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. Newmont sold the mine in late 2007; it is now owned by Conquest Mining.
Bronzewing Gold Mine: View Resources purchased the mine in July 2004 from Newmont for A$9.0 million, a package that also included the McClure mining operation, 8 km west of Bronzewing.[23]
Wiluna Gold Mine: Also part of the Normandy acquisition, Gowit Limited, later Agincourt Resources, purchased the mine on 10 December 2003 from Newmont for shares and $3.65 million in cash.[24][25]
Zarafshan: Newmont was part of a joint venture gold project in Uzbekistan, the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A difficult place to operate, Uzbekistan expropriates the company’s assets in 2006.
Kori Kollo: The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont had an 88% interest. The remaining 12% was owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owned and operated the mine. On July 23, 2009, Newmont announced the transfer of its interest in Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., which owned the Kori Kollo gold mine and Kori Chaca gold mine, to Compania Procesadora de Minerales S.A. ("CPM"), a company controlled by Newmont's long-time Bolivian partner Jose Mercado.
Minahasa: Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004.
Golden Giant: Newmont's Canadian operations previously included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) was located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon, Ontario, Canada, and had been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout most of 2006.
Holloway: Holloway was located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson, Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant. It was in production since 1996. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.
Empire-Star: Located in Grass Valley, California, the mine has been closed since 1957

Controversies[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (January 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Nevada operations[edit]
In July 2009, the Mine Safety and Health Administration announced that four supervisors for the Denver-based mining company have agreed to pay a combined $60,000 in individual penalties for their role in the accident at the Midas Mine north of Elko in June 2007. The agency said managers "showed a disregard for the miners' welfare" and acted with "more than ordinary negligence" before the victim fell through a sinkhole while operating a large loader about 200 feet below the entrance of the mine." [26]
State tax deductions[edit]
In March 2011, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval replaced his director of taxation, citing problems in auditing tax deductions.[27] Statements by both Nevada Mining Association President Tim Crowley[28] and Republican Assembly Minority Floor Leader Pete Goicoechea of Eureka County in Nevada (the county where a majority of Newmont's Nevada operations are located)[29] made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper.[30] This prompted the state legislature to call for "emergency regulations" to disallow some tax deductions.[31]
In April 2011, it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions, which had been approved by the Nevada Tax Commission.[30] The outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years.[27] This is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees, such as Robert J Miller, who served a director of Newmont Mining Corporation right after being Governor of Nevada for a decade.[30][not in citation given] Miller was succeeded by the late Kenny Guinn, who proposed a tax restructuring during the 2003 legislative session that was met with opposition from anti-tax business groups and many anti-tax Republicans.[citation needed]
FIN 48 an interpretation of FASB 109 requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities (or litigation).[32]
The 76th Session of the Nevada Legislature (2011), passed Senate Bill 493, over opposition from the mining industry. Senate Bill 493 "...creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, a seven-member panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation. An amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes." Some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections: "'If you don’t let us deduct this, we’ll deduct something else.'" A Newmont Mining Corp. staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction, saying employee housing cut travel costs." [27] The mines in Nevada were to report their deductions to the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, which was created under S.B. 493.[citation needed]
Batu Hijau mine, Indonesia[edit]
On 6 August 2010, a 5 day long strike, which had completely shut US-based Newmont Mining Corp.’s Batu Hijau mines and operations on Sumbawa Island ended after some 1,500 miners of the PT NNT labour union, affiliated to the Chemical, Energy, Mine Workers’ Union of the Indonesia Workers’ Union, agreed to await an overtime pay judgment from a provincial government. "The dispute started some three weeks after the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry of West Nusa Tenggara Province issued an order that management was in arrears on Rp 126 billion (US$13.8 million) in overtime wages to some 1,919 workers dating back to 2008." [33]

Yanacocha mine, Peru[edit]




The "Minera Yanacocha" gold mine near Cajamarca (Peru)


The Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru is considered one of the largest and most profitable in the world, producing over US$7 billion worth of gold to date. Before 1994 the mine was co-owned by Newmont, Buenaventura (a Peruvian mining company), and Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), a French government-owned company. This partnership collapsed in 1994 after BRGM tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an Australian company which was a rival of Newmont. Newmont and Buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade.
Larry Kurlander, then a senior executive at Newmont, claimed the French President Jacques Chirac had sent a letter to then Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the French owned company. Kurlander had been sent by Newmont to Peru to try to get a favorable outcome for Newmont in the dispute. The legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the Peruvian Supreme Court.
During this period Kurlander acknowledges having met with Vladimiro Montesinos, the Peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement, illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, influence peddling and bribing TV stations. [4] [5] However, Kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the French government were taking similar steps in trying to contact Montesinos. The French ambassador to Peru Antoine Blanca denies this, pointing to the fact that Montesinos was on the CIA payroll and thus would naturally side with the U.S-based company.
After the fall of Fujimori in 2000 a number of videos Montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged. In October 2005 Frontline in co-production with The New York Times found a February 1998 recording of a telephone conversation between Montesinos and Kurlander. The following is an excerpt from the tape:

Kurlander:...we have a very serious problem in Peru with our company (Newmont) and Minera Buenaventura so I have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities. I need it especially because the other side (the French government) has been acting quite strangely.


Montesinos (to interpreter): Tell him that I am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the French, as well as the problem he has with the judiciary.


Kurlander: So now you have a friend for life. I want a friend for life.


Montesinos (to interpreter): I thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend. Tell him I'm going to help him with the voting. I would like to know the tricky practices of the French. The French Connection!


Kurlander: The French Connection!


(laughter) [34]

Along with this telephone conversation, Frontline and The New York Times also re-broadcast three other videos. One was filmed in April 1998 and shows Montesinos talking to "Don Arabian", the CIA station chief in Peru, in an attempt to get CIA to pressure the U.S. to back Newmont in the case. In the video Montesinos claims to have found e-mails from Paris to Peru of French officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to France.
Another video recorded in May 1998 shows Montesinos meeting with Peruvian Supreme Court Justice, and former classmate, Jaime Beltran Quiroga. In it Montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between Newmont and BRGM. He tells Quiroga that if the decision goes to Newmont that the United States will back Peru in its border dispute with Ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the Cenepa War. He also tells Quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press. Quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case, his vote would be the deciding vote in the Newmont victory. After the video was first broadcast in Peru in 2001, on a Peruvian local television station the French Ambassador Antoine Blanca was quoted as saying "Now I know why Newmont won".
In the final July 1999 video, Montesinos is again seen with the now departing CIA station chief "Don Arabian" giving him a gift and thanking him for the help he has given Peru stating "[W]e hope that when you're back their [in Washington] you'll remember your friends".
Buyat Bay, Sulawesi, Indonesia[edit]
In August 2004, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment filed a US$133.6 million civil lawsuit against Newmont,[35] claiming tailings from the company's Minahasa Raya mine polluted Buyat Bay in the North Sulawesi province, contaminating local fish stocks and causing nearby villagers to become seriously ill. Newmont denied the allegations, arguing that the illnesses had more to do with poor hygiene and poverty. On November 15, 2005, a South Jakarta court dismissed the suit on technical grounds, saying the government had breached the terms of its contract with Newmont when it took legal action before seeking arbitration. Environmentalists urged for the suit to be appealed, but on December 1, 2005, Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar said the government expected to reach an out-of-court settlement with Newmont's local subsidiary. "By negotiating a settlement, we hope to be able to quickly compensate people living near the mine," he said. The government negotiating team was led by chief Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie. On February 16, 2006, the Indonesian government announced it would settle the civil suit for US$30 million to be paid over the next 10 years. The agreement also includes increased scientific monitoring and enhanced community development programs for the North Sulawesi province.
With the civil lawsuit settled, attention focused on the criminal charges against President Director Richard Ness. In December 2006, Newmont Mining Corp. objected to a documentary entitled Bye Bye Buyat being nominated for Indonesia's top film award, FFI's Citra Award. The company said that it interfered with Ness' ongoing trial.[36]
After a 21-month trial—one of the longest proceedings in Indonesian history—Ness was found innocent of the pollution charges on April 24, 2007.[37] The court found that the company was in compliance with all regulations and permits during its operations at the site, and failed to find evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Nemont's subsidiary had polluted Buyat Bay. At the end of May, the prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.[37]
A week after being found not guilty of criminal charges, Richard Ness sued The New York Times in Indonesian court for libel. The lawsuit asks for nearly US$65 million in damages, and that The New York Times print a page-one retraction of previously published articles.[38] In October 2007 an Indonesian court threw out the suit stating it was not within their jurisdiction. The case was being appealed.[39]
Akyem, Ghana[edit]
Newmont received the 2009 Public Eye award for its Akyem project in Ghana. According to the jury it had destroyed unique natural habitats, carried out forced resettlement of local people and polluted soil and rivers.[40] Newmont described the information as misleading and said the project had been extensively studied by international and national environmental experts, members of the local communities, and by the appropriate governmental agencies and departments.[41]
In January 2010, Ghanaian authorities brought a lawsuit against Newmont Mining for a reported US$4.9 million.[42]. The lawsuit accused Newmont of negligently spilling cyanide at its Ahafo gold mine in October 2009, resulting in water contamination and fish kills.[43] Newmont disputed the accusation, but agreed in March 2010 to pay compensation "in accordance with the law".[44]

What Could Drive Newmont Mining’s Production in 2017 and Beyond?

Production growth drivers
Newmont Mining (NEM) has been trying to achieve higher production every quarter. Its gold production totaled 1.3 million ounces in 4Q16, which represents 17% growth year-over-year (or YoY). The company’s 2016 production totaled 4.9 million ounces, a gain of 7% compared to 2015.

The major reasons behind Newmont Mining’s year-over-year increments in 4Q16 include the following:



new production at Merian and Long Canyon
offset grade reductions at Yanacocha
increased production at CC&V (Cripple Creek and Victor) mine
Investors should note that Newmont Mining acquired CC&V from AngloGold Ashanti (AU) in June 2015.
Production outlook
Newmont Mining (NEM) maintained its steady gold production outlook of 4.5 million–5.0 million ounces for the next five years. In 2017, the company expects its production to increase to 4.9 million–5.4 million ounces.
The increased production is mainly attributable to the full-year production of its Merian and Long Canyon mines, which would offset lower production at Twin Creeks and Yanacocha.
More upside ahead
Investors should also note that Newmont Mining’s Merian project came online on October 1, 2016, which was 20% below capital budget and on time. The company noted that it expects its annual production to average between 400,000–500,000 ounces of gold at “competitive costs” in the first five full years of operation.
NEM’s Long Canyon project also came online on November 15, 2016, also ahead of schedule and under budget. The company has included additional projects in its medium-term outlook.
Newmont Mining’s peers (GDX) are also trying to increase their production. Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) and Goldcorp (GG) have stable production profiles, and Barrick Gold’s (ABX) project pipeline has also been improving. Although Kinross Gold (KGC) has some acquisitions to improve its production, the company still might have problems replacing its reserves in the long term.
In the next part, we’ll discuss Newmont Mining’s project pipeline in detail.

The gold miner declared commercial production based on sustaining plant availability of over 85% and achieving at least 70% of modeled leach recovery.The project was completed two months before schedule for just below $225 million which was around $50 million or 18% below budget. During the first phase, Newmont is expected to produce between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold annually over an eight-year mine life at some of the lowest costs in its portfolio. Costs applicable to sales are anticipated to be in the range of $400 to $500 per ounce while all-in sustaining costs are projected to be between $500 and $600 per ounce.Newmont took a phased development approach to optimize the project, utilizing refurbished equipment instead of new, building a leach facility instead of a mill, as well as leveraging the established infrastructure, expertise and stakeholder relationships in Nevada. The project is expected to generate a 26% rate of return with a payback period of just below four years at current gold prices.Newmont has grown the resource base at Long Canyon by 30% in two years. Long Canyon is among the four profitable operations the company has added to its portfolio over the last three years and is the most significant oxide gold discovery in Nevada in more than a decade. Phase Two studies are currently underway at the mine and Newmont expects to complete these and secure the required permits to proceed before Phase One is depleted.Newmont’s shares closed around 4% higher at $33.91 yesterday.NEWMONT MINING Price NEWMONT MINING Price | NEWMONT MINING QuoteNewmont’s adjusted earnings for third-quarter 2016 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues rose by double digits year over year, but missed expectations.The company’s attributable gold production rose roughly 3% year over year to 1.25 million ounces in the quarter, with increases at Cripple Creek & Victor, Carlin and Boddington mines more than offseting lower production at Yanacocha. Newmont anticipates attributable gold production to be in the range of 4.8–5 million ounces in 2016.Newmont continues to invest in growth projects that are expected to boost its production performance. The company is also making significant progress with its cost and efficiency improvement programs, which is allowing it to generate positive free cash flow. However, Newmont is exposed to a volatile pricing environment and challenges in the copper market.Newmont, earlier this month, closed the sale of its 48.5% ownership interest in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), which operates the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine in Indonesia, to PT Amman Mineral Internasional (“PTAMI”) for a total consideration of $1.3 billion. The company said that it will utilize the proceeds from the transaction to finance its highest margin projects, pare debt and pay dividends.Newmont currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Other Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked companies in the basic materials space include BHP Billiton Limited BHP, Vale S.A.

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: August 08, 2003

 Describes events associated with Vladimiro Montesinos, Peru's intelligence chief and advisor to President Fujimori, his network, and interventions in affairs of the Newmont Mining Corp. Newmont, a U.S. company established in 1921, proclaimed its corporate values to be "behaving with integrity, working loyally, inspiring trust, telling the truth, caring for our colleagues and cooperating with our community." Yet, on February 26, 1998, Lawrence T. Kurlander, a vice president of Newmont, met with Vladimiro Montesinos Torres in Montesinos' office at the Servicio de Intelligencia Nacional (the national intelligence service) to seek his help in getting a resolution favorable to Newmont in a quarrel with the French company Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM) over their shared ownership of the Yanacocha mine. The mine was the richest gold mine in Latin America and one of the biggest in the world. BRGM wanted to sell part of its 25% share in Yanacocha to Normandy Ltd., an Australian mining company. Newmont sued to block the sale and to gain control of the mine for itself. The dispute had made its way to the Supreme Court of Peru. Montesinos secretly taped his conversation with Kurlander, as was his habit, and the tapes provide a rare inside view of how business gets done where the rule of law is subordinated to political influence.

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: March 22, 2013

 The CEO of Newmont Mining Corporation (Newmont) had learned that a subcontractor's truck en route to Lima from Yanacocha, a gold mine operated by Newmont, spilled mercury along the highway and in small villages. Local residents had picked up some mercury with their bare hands and taken it to their homes. The CEO was trying to determine the best way to handle the situation. This A case describes the mine developer's history, the operations at Newmont's most profitable gold mine, the significance of foreign investment to Peru's economy, the environmental impact of gold mining and the local and anti-mining movements' responses to mine operations. In the B case, Newmont Mining Corp. and a Mercury Spill in Peru (B) 9B13M003, the new CEO is trying to decide what else Newmont is morally required to implement before continuing to operate Yanacocha, and Newmont's other mines, successfully. Authors Jaana Woiceshyn and Allan Ingelson are affiliated with the University of Calgary.

History[edit]




William Boyce Thompson, founder of Newmont Mining


Early years[edit]
Newmont Mining Corporation was founded in 1916 in New York by Colonel William Boyce Thompson as a holding company to invest in Worldwide mineral, oil, and related companies. According to company lore, the name "Newmont" is a portmanteau "New York" and "Montana", reflecting where Thompson made his fortune and where he grew up.[6]
In 1929, Newmont became a mining company with its first gold product in by acquiring California's Empire Star Mine. By 1939, Newmont was operating 12 gold mines in North America.
The company acquired interests overseas. For decades around the middle of the 20th century, Newmont had a controlling interest in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia and in the O'Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand, South Africa.
Beginning in 1925, Newmont acquired interests in a Texas oil field. Eventually, Newmont's oil interests included more than 70 blocks in the Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico area and oil and gas production in the North Sea.
Newmont discovered the world's first submicroscopic or "invisible" gold at Carlin, Nevada in the early 1960s and began production on the first open pit gold mine in the world. The "Carlin Trend" or "Carlin Unconformity" is the largest gold discovery in North America during the 20th century. In 1971 Newmont began using the heap leaching technology on sub-mill grade ores there.
In the 1980s, Newmont thwarted five takeover bids – from Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold), T. Boone Pickens, Minorco, Hanson Industries and Sir James Goldsmith – who sought to break Newmont apart and sell its assets to increase shareholder value.
Major growth[edit]
After 1987, the company undertook major restructuring. This included the payment of a US$33 per share dividend to all shareholders for a total of US$2.2 billion, of which US$1.75 billion was borrowed. To reduce this debt the company undertook a divestment program involving all of its copper, oil, gas, and coal interests.
As a further step in the restructuring, the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Denver in 1988. A decade later, Newmont Mining Corporation and Newmont Gold Company combined assets to form a unified worldwide gold company. Shareholders of both companies had identical interests in the reserves, production and earnings of Newmont Gold's operations.
Newmont then merged with Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation (a former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway subsidiary, sold in preparation for the merger that produced the BNSF Railway[7]) to form North America's largest gold producer.
On June 21, 2000, Newmont announced a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. The merger was completed in January 2001.
In February 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Normandy Mining Limited and Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited. Newmont faced competition in its bid for Normandy from AngloGold. By eventually outbiding the South African company, Newmont became the world's largest gold producer, with an annual production in excess of 8 million ounces.[8]
In 2007, the company eliminated its 1.5 million ounce legacy hedge book to make Newmont the world’s largest unhedged gold producer. The following year, Newmont acquired Miramar Mining Corporation and its Hope Bay deposit in the Canadian Arctic.
In late 2008, Newmont moved its headquarters from Denver to the suburb of Greenwood Village, Colorado.[9]
In 2009, Newmont purchased the remaining one-third interest in Boddington Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti, bringing its ownership to 100 percent.
In April 2011, the company acquired Canada's Fronteer Gold Inc. for Cdn $2.3 billion. This made the company the world's second-largest gold producer.[10]
Operations and major projects[edit]




Gold Quarry mine, near Carlin, Nevada, 2009.


Nevada[edit]
As of 2011, Newmont’s Nevada 14 open-pit and four underground operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend; the Phoenix gold/copper mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of Golconda; and the Midas mine, near the town of the same name. It also participates in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
With the acquisition of Fronteer Gold, over sixty additional projects were added to the Newmont portfolio. The flagship property, Long Canyon, is located on a gold trend that is similar to the Carlin Trend in terms of its characteristics and potential.
Colorado[edit]
In August 2015, Newmont purchased the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti. The mine is the largest gold and silver producer in the state of Colorado.[11]
Yanacocha, Peru[edit]
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interest held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha’s mining rights consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines: Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. In addition, reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San Jose and Maqui Maqui are currently underway.
Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million ounces (750,000 attributable ounces). As of December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2011, Newmont’s board of directors granted approval to develop the Conga Project, located in the provinces of Celendín, and Sorochuco Huasmín districts and Cajamarca district of Encañada. Newmont’s ownership interest is identical to Yanacocha. If all permits are secured, the commencement of production is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.[12]
In 2015, agents acting on behalf of Newmont Mining Corporation attacked and beat a woman who refused to move from her home to allow for the development of a mine.

Australia[edit]
Newmont acquired its Australian assets with the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002.[17][18]
Boddington. Newmont’s newest Australian asset is Boddington, which is now Australia's largest gold producer. It has been wholly owned since June 2009, when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010. As of year-end 2010, it reported 20.3 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves.
Tanami. The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites.
The Tanami operations have been wholly owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests. Operations today are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold. As of December 31, 2010, it had a reported 2.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest.




The Super Pit gold mine


In 2010, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold (377,000 attributable ounces). It reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves on December 31, 2010.
New Zealand[edit]
Newmont acquired its Waihi assets as part of the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002. The Waihi operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves at the end of the year.
Martha. The Martha Mine operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. The open pit mine has operated over historic underground gold mine workings since 1988.
Favona. The Favona underground mine began extracting ore at the end of 2006.
Batu Hijau, Sumbawa, Indonesia[edit]




Haul trucks at the Batu Hijau open pit, 2009


Newmont operates the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa in the Indonesia in the province of West Nusa Tenggara through its subsidiary company P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara which is a joint venture between Newmont, Sumitomo Corporation and P.T. Pukuafu Indah.
Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced 542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable ounces). On December 31, 2010, it reported 3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and 3.7 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2008, the Indonesian government threatened to terminate the contract of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara after accusing it of failing to meet its divestment obligations. On April 1, 2009, international arbitrators and its partner sided with Newmont rejecting Jakarta's request to have their contract revoked, which would have forced the company to walk away from the property without any compensation. Instead Newmont was forced to sell a 17% stake in an Indonesian subsidiary within 180 days.[19]
In 2011, subsidiaries of Newmont and Sumitomo Corporation divested a 7 percent investment in PTNNT. Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), designated as the buyer by the Indonesian Government, signed a sale and purchase agreement for the shares worth $246.8 million. Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V., which holds Newmont’s shares in PTNNT – together with shares held by a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan – now owns 49 percent of PTNNT. Of that amount, Newmont will directly own 27.56 percent of PTNNT and has another 17 percent economic interest through financing arrangements with existing shareholders.[20]
Ghana[edit]
The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Newmont operates four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010.
Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010, reported 10.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Additionally, Newmont’s Akyem Mine (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In January 2010, Newmont received the mining lease. After close to two years of construction, the Akyem mine commenced commercial production in late 2013.
At December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves.
Other operations[edit]
Mexico[edit]
Newmont has a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura produced 174,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, it had 2.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Former operations[edit]
Newmont has purchased and sold a number of operations in recent years:

Golden Grove Mine: Owned by Normandy Mining Limited since 1991, Golden Grove was acquired by Newmont Australia Ltd in February 2002 when Newmont took over Normandy.[21] Newmont sold on the mine to Oxiana Limited in June 2005 for A$265 million.[22]
Pajingo: Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Townsville, Queensland and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. Newmont sold the mine in late 2007; it is now owned by Conquest Mining.
Bronzewing Gold Mine: View Resources purchased the mine in July 2004 from Newmont for A$9.0 million, a package that also included the McClure mining operation, 8 km west of Bronzewing.[23]
Wiluna Gold Mine: Also part of the Normandy acquisition, Gowit Limited, later Agincourt Resources, purchased the mine on 10 December 2003 from Newmont for shares and $3.65 million in cash.[24][25]
Zarafshan: Newmont was part of a joint venture gold project in Uzbekistan, the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A difficult place to operate, Uzbekistan expropriates the company’s assets in 2006.
Kori Kollo: The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont had an 88% interest. The remaining 12% was owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owned and operated the mine. On July 23, 2009, Newmont announced the transfer of its interest in Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., which owned the Kori Kollo gold mine and Kori Chaca gold mine, to Compania Procesadora de Minerales S.A. ("CPM"), a company controlled by Newmont's long-time Bolivian partner Jose Mercado.
Minahasa: Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004.
Golden Giant: Newmont's Canadian operations previously included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) was located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon, Ontario, Canada, and had been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout most of 2006.
Holloway: Holloway was located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson, Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant. It was in production since 1996. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.
Empire-Star: Located in Grass Valley, California, the mine has been closed since 1957

Controversies[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (January 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Nevada operations[edit]
In July 2009, the Mine Safety and Health Administration announced that four supervisors for the Denver-based mining company have agreed to pay a combined $60,000 in individual penalties for their role in the accident at the Midas Mine north of Elko in June 2007. The agency said managers "showed a disregard for the miners' welfare" and acted with "more than ordinary negligence" before the victim fell through a sinkhole while operating a large loader about 200 feet below the entrance of the mine." [26]
State tax deductions[edit]
In March 2011, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval replaced his director of taxation, citing problems in auditing tax deductions.[27] Statements by both Nevada Mining Association President Tim Crowley[28] and Republican Assembly Minority Floor Leader Pete Goicoechea of Eureka County in Nevada (the county where a majority of Newmont's Nevada operations are located)[29] made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper.[30] This prompted the state legislature to call for "emergency regulations" to disallow some tax deductions.[31]
In April 2011, it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions, which had been approved by the Nevada Tax Commission.[30] The outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years.[27] This is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees, such as Robert J Miller, who served a director of Newmont Mining Corporation right after being Governor of Nevada for a decade.[30][not in citation given] Miller was succeeded by the late Kenny Guinn, who proposed a tax restructuring during the 2003 legislative session that was met with opposition from anti-tax business groups and many anti-tax Republicans.[citation needed]
FIN 48 an interpretation of FASB 109 requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities (or litigation).[32]
The 76th Session of the Nevada Legislature (2011), passed Senate Bill 493, over opposition from the mining industry. Senate Bill 493 "...creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, a seven-member panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation. An amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes." Some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections: "'If you don’t let us deduct this, we’ll deduct something else.'" A Newmont Mining Corp. staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction, saying employee housing cut travel costs." [27] The mines in Nevada were to report their deductions to the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, which was created under S.B. 493.[citation needed]
Batu Hijau mine, Indonesia[edit]
On 6 August 2010, a 5 day long strike, which had completely shut US-based Newmont Mining Corp.’s Batu Hijau mines and operations on Sumbawa Island ended after some 1,500 miners of the PT NNT labour union, affiliated to the Chemical, Energy, Mine Workers’ Union of the Indonesia Workers’ Union, agreed to await an overtime pay judgment from a provincial government. "The dispute started some three weeks after the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry of West Nusa Tenggara Province issued an order that management was in arrears on Rp 126 billion (US$13.8 million) in overtime wages to some 1,919 workers dating back to 2008." [33]

Yanacocha mine, Peru[edit]




The "Minera Yanacocha" gold mine near Cajamarca (Peru)


The Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru is considered one of the largest and most profitable in the world, producing over US$7 billion worth of gold to date. Before 1994 the mine was co-owned by Newmont, Buenaventura (a Peruvian mining company), and Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), a French government-owned company. This partnership collapsed in 1994 after BRGM tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an Australian company which was a rival of Newmont. Newmont and Buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade.
Larry Kurlander, then a senior executive at Newmont, claimed the French President Jacques Chirac had sent a letter to then Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the French owned company. Kurlander had been sent by Newmont to Peru to try to get a favorable outcome for Newmont in the dispute. The legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the Peruvian Supreme Court.
During this period Kurlander acknowledges having met with Vladimiro Montesinos, the Peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement, illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, influence peddling and bribing TV stations. [4] [5] However, Kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the French government were taking similar steps in trying to contact Montesinos. The French ambassador to Peru Antoine Blanca denies this, pointing to the fact that Montesinos was on the CIA payroll and thus would naturally side with the U.S-based company.
After the fall of Fujimori in 2000 a number of videos Montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged. In October 2005 Frontline in co-production with The New York Times found a February 1998 recording of a telephone conversation between Montesinos and Kurlander. The following is an excerpt from the tape:

Kurlander:...we have a very serious problem in Peru with our company (Newmont) and Minera Buenaventura so I have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities. I need it especially because the other side (the French government) has been acting quite strangely.


Montesinos (to interpreter): Tell him that I am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the French, as well as the problem he has with the judiciary.


Kurlander: So now you have a friend for life. I want a friend for life.


Montesinos (to interpreter): I thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend. Tell him I'm going to help him with the voting. I would like to know the tricky practices of the French. The French Connection!


Kurlander: The French Connection!


(laughter) [34]

Along with this telephone conversation, Frontline and The New York Times also re-broadcast three other videos. One was filmed in April 1998 and shows Montesinos talking to "Don Arabian", the CIA station chief in Peru, in an attempt to get CIA to pressure the U.S. to back Newmont in the case. In the video Montesinos claims to have found e-mails from Paris to Peru of French officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to France.
Another video recorded in May 1998 shows Montesinos meeting with Peruvian Supreme Court Justice, and former classmate, Jaime Beltran Quiroga. In it Montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between Newmont and BRGM. He tells Quiroga that if the decision goes to Newmont that the United States will back Peru in its border dispute with Ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the Cenepa War. He also tells Quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press. Quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case, his vote would be the deciding vote in the Newmont victory. After the video was first broadcast in Peru in 2001, on a Peruvian local television station the French Ambassador Antoine Blanca was quoted as saying "Now I know why Newmont won".
In the final July 1999 video, Montesinos is again seen with the now departing CIA station chief "Don Arabian" giving him a gift and thanking him for the help he has given Peru stating "[W]e hope that when you're back their [in Washington] you'll remember your friends".
Buyat Bay, Sulawesi, Indonesia[edit]
In August 2004, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment filed a US$133.6 million civil lawsuit against Newmont,[35] claiming tailings from the company's Minahasa Raya mine polluted Buyat Bay in the North Sulawesi province, contaminating local fish stocks and causing nearby villagers to become seriously ill. Newmont denied the allegations, arguing that the illnesses had more to do with poor hygiene and poverty. On November 15, 2005, a South Jakarta court dismissed the suit on technical grounds, saying the government had breached the terms of its contract with Newmont when it took legal action before seeking arbitration. Environmentalists urged for the suit to be appealed, but on December 1, 2005, Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar said the government expected to reach an out-of-court settlement with Newmont's local subsidiary. "By negotiating a settlement, we hope to be able to quickly compensate people living near the mine," he said. The government negotiating team was led by chief Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie. On February 16, 2006, the Indonesian government announced it would settle the civil suit for US$30 million to be paid over the next 10 years. The agreement also includes increased scientific monitoring and enhanced community development programs for the North Sulawesi province.
With the civil lawsuit settled, attention focused on the criminal charges against President Director Richard Ness. In December 2006, Newmont Mining Corp. objected to a documentary entitled Bye Bye Buyat being nominated for Indonesia's top film award, FFI's Citra Award. The company said that it interfered with Ness' ongoing trial.[36]
After a 21-month trial—one of the longest proceedings in Indonesian history—Ness was found innocent of the pollution charges on April 24, 2007.[37] The court found that the company was in compliance with all regulations and permits during its operations at the site, and failed to find evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Nemont's subsidiary had polluted Buyat Bay. At the end of May, the prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.[37]
A week after being found not guilty of criminal charges, Richard Ness sued The New York Times in Indonesian court for libel. The lawsuit asks for nearly US$65 million in damages, and that The New York Times print a page-one retraction of previously published articles.[38] In October 2007 an Indonesian court threw out the suit stating it was not within their jurisdiction. The case was being appealed.[39]
Akyem, Ghana[edit]
Newmont received the 2009 Public Eye award for its Akyem project in Ghana. According to the jury it had destroyed unique natural habitats, carried out forced resettlement of local people and polluted soil and rivers.[40] Newmont described the information as misleading and said the project had been extensively studied by international and national environmental experts, members of the local communities, and by the appropriate governmental agencies and departments.[41]
In January 2010, Ghanaian authorities brought a lawsuit against Newmont Mining for a reported US$4.9 million.[42]. The lawsuit accused Newmont of negligently spilling cyanide at its Ahafo gold mine in October 2009, resulting in water contamination and fish kills.[43] Newmont disputed the accusation, but agreed in March 2010 to pay compensation "in accordance with the law".[44]

History[edit]




William Boyce Thompson, founder of Newmont Mining


Early years[edit]
Newmont Mining Corporation was founded in 1916 in New York by Colonel William Boyce Thompson as a holding company to invest in Worldwide mineral, oil, and related companies. According to company lore, the name "Newmont" is a portmanteau "New York" and "Montana", reflecting where Thompson made his fortune and where he grew up.[6]
In 1929, Newmont became a mining company with its first gold product in by acquiring California's Empire Star Mine. By 1939, Newmont was operating 12 gold mines in North America.
The company acquired interests overseas. For decades around the middle of the 20th century, Newmont had a controlling interest in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia and in the O'Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand, South Africa.
Beginning in 1925, Newmont acquired interests in a Texas oil field. Eventually, Newmont's oil interests included more than 70 blocks in the Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico area and oil and gas production in the North Sea.
Newmont discovered the world's first submicroscopic or "invisible" gold at Carlin, Nevada in the early 1960s and began production on the first open pit gold mine in the world. The "Carlin Trend" or "Carlin Unconformity" is the largest gold discovery in North America during the 20th century. In 1971 Newmont began using the heap leaching technology on sub-mill grade ores there.
In the 1980s, Newmont thwarted five takeover bids – from Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold), T. Boone Pickens, Minorco, Hanson Industries and Sir James Goldsmith – who sought to break Newmont apart and sell its assets to increase shareholder value.
Major growth[edit]
After 1987, the company undertook major restructuring. This included the payment of a US$33 per share dividend to all shareholders for a total of US$2.2 billion, of which US$1.75 billion was borrowed. To reduce this debt the company undertook a divestment program involving all of its copper, oil, gas, and coal interests.
As a further step in the restructuring, the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Denver in 1988. A decade later, Newmont Mining Corporation and Newmont Gold Company combined assets to form a unified worldwide gold company. Shareholders of both companies had identical interests in the reserves, production and earnings of Newmont Gold's operations.
Newmont then merged with Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation (a former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway subsidiary, sold in preparation for the merger that produced the BNSF Railway[7]) to form North America's largest gold producer.
On June 21, 2000, Newmont announced a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. The merger was completed in January 2001.
In February 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Normandy Mining Limited and Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited. Newmont faced competition in its bid for Normandy from AngloGold. By eventually outbiding the South African company, Newmont became the world's largest gold producer, with an annual production in excess of 8 million ounces.[8]
In 2007, the company eliminated its 1.5 million ounce legacy hedge book to make Newmont the world’s largest unhedged gold producer. The following year, Newmont acquired Miramar Mining Corporation and its Hope Bay deposit in the Canadian Arctic.
In late 2008, Newmont moved its headquarters from Denver to the suburb of Greenwood Village, Colorado.[9]
In 2009, Newmont purchased the remaining one-third interest in Boddington Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti, bringing its ownership to 100 percent.
In April 2011, the company acquired Canada's Fronteer Gold Inc. for Cdn $2.3 billion. This made the company the world's second-largest gold producer.[10]
Operations and major projects[edit]

Nevada[edit]
As of 2011, Newmont’s Nevada 14 open-pit and four underground operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend; the Phoenix gold/copper mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of Golconda; and the Midas mine, near the town of the same name. It also participates in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
With the acquisition of Fronteer Gold, over sixty additional projects were added to the Newmont portfolio. The flagship property, Long Canyon, is located on a gold trend that is similar to the Carlin Trend in terms of its characteristics and potential.
Colorado[edit]
In August 2015, Newmont purchased the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti. The mine is the largest gold and silver producer in the state of Colorado.[11]
Yanacocha, Peru[edit]
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interest held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha’s mining rights consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines: Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. In addition, reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San Jose and Maqui Maqui are currently underway.
Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million ounces (750,000 attributable ounces). As of December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2011, Newmont’s board of directors granted approval to develop the Conga Project, located in the provinces of Celendín, and Sorochuco Huasmín districts and Cajamarca district of Encañada. Newmont’s ownership interest is identical to Yanacocha. If all permits are secured, the commencement of production is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.[12]
In 2015, agents acting on behalf of Newmont Mining Corporation attacked and beat a woman who refused to move from her home to allow for the development of a mine.
Indigenous Peruvian farmworker Maxima Acuña de Chaupe withstood violent eviction attempts, beatings, and a legal battle to protect her land from being turned into an open-pit gold mine[13]

Australia[edit]
Newmont acquired its Australian assets with the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002.[17][18]
Boddington. Newmont’s newest Australian asset is Boddington, which is now Australia's largest gold producer. It has been wholly owned since June 2009, when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010. As of year-end 2010, it reported 20.3 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves.
Tanami. The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites.
The Tanami operations have been wholly owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests. Operations today are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold. As of December 31, 2010, it had a reported 2.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest.




The Super Pit gold mine


In 2010, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold (377,000 attributable ounces). It reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves on December 31, 2010.
New Zealand[edit]
Newmont acquired its Waihi assets as part of the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002. The Waihi operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves at the end of the year.
Martha. The Martha Mine operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. The open pit mine has operated over historic underground gold mine workings since 1988.
Favona. The Favona underground mine began extracting ore at the end of 2006.
Batu Hijau, Sumbawa, Indonesia[edit]




Haul trucks at the Batu Hijau open pit, 2009


Newmont operates the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa in the Indonesia in the province of West Nusa Tenggara through its subsidiary company P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara which is a joint venture between Newmont, Sumitomo Corporation and P.T. Pukuafu Indah.
Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced 542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable ounces). On December 31, 2010, it reported 3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and 3.7 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2008, the Indonesian government threatened to terminate the contract of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara after accusing it of failing to meet its divestment obligations. On April 1, 2009, international arbitrators and its partner sided with Newmont rejecting Jakarta's request to have their contract revoked, which would have forced the company to walk away from the property without any compensation. Instead Newmont was forced to sell a 17% stake in an Indonesian subsidiary within 180 days.[19]
In 2011, subsidiaries of Newmont and Sumitomo Corporation divested a 7 percent investment in PTNNT. Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), designated as the buyer by the Indonesian Government, signed a sale and purchase agreement for the shares worth $246.8 million. Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V., which holds Newmont’s shares in PTNNT – together with shares held by a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan – now owns 49 percent of PTNNT. Of that amount, Newmont will directly own 27.56 percent of PTNNT and has another 17 percent economic interest through financing arrangements with existing shareholders.[20]
Ghana[edit]
The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Newmont operates four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010.
Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010, reported 10.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Additionally, Newmont’s Akyem Mine (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In January 2010, Newmont received the mining lease. After close to two years of construction, the Akyem mine commenced commercial production in late 2013.
At December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves.
Other operations[edit]
Mexico[edit]
Newmont has a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura produced 174,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, it had 2.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Former operations[edit]
Newmont has purchased and sold a number of operations in recent years:

Golden Grove Mine: Owned by Normandy Mining Limited since 1991, Golden Grove was acquired by Newmont Australia Ltd in February 2002 when Newmont took over Normandy.[21] Newmont sold on the mine to Oxiana Limited in June 2005 for A$265 million.[22]
Pajingo: Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Townsville, Queensland and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. Newmont sold the mine in late 2007; it is now owned by Conquest Mining.
Bronzewing Gold Mine: View Resources purchased the mine in July 2004 from Newmont for A$9.0 million, a package that also included the McClure mining operation, 8 km west of Bronzewing.[23]
Wiluna Gold Mine: Also part of the Normandy acquisition, Gowit Limited, later Agincourt Resources, purchased the mine on 10 December 2003 from Newmont for shares and $3.65 million in cash.[24][25]
Zarafshan: Newmont was part of a joint venture gold project in Uzbekistan, the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A difficult place to operate, Uzbekistan expropriates the company’s assets in 2006.
Kori Kollo: The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont had an 88% interest. The remaining 12% was owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owned and operated the mine. On July 23, 2009, Newmont announced the transfer of its interest in Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., which owned the Kori Kollo gold mine and Kori Chaca gold mine, to Compania Procesadora de Minerales S.A. ("CPM"), a company controlled by Newmont's long-time Bolivian partner Jose Mercado.
Minahasa: Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004.
Golden Giant: Newmont's Canadian operations previously included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) was located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon, Ontario, Canada, and had been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout most of 2006.
Holloway: Holloway was located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson, Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant. It was in production since 1996. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.
Empire-Star: Located in Grass Valley, California, the mine has been closed since 1957

Controversies[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (January 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Nevada operations[edit]
In July 2009, the Mine Safety and Health Administration announced that four supervisors for the Denver-based mining company have agreed to pay a combined $60,000 in individual penalties for their role in the accident at the Midas Mine north of Elko in June 2007. The agency said managers "showed a disregard for the miners' welfare" and acted with "more than ordinary negligence" before the victim fell through a sinkhole while operating a large loader about 200 feet below the entrance of the mine." [26]
State tax deductions[edit]
In March 2011, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval replaced his director of taxation, citing problems in auditing tax deductions.[27] Statements by both Nevada Mining Association President Tim Crowley[28] and Republican Assembly Minority Floor Leader Pete Goicoechea of Eureka County in Nevada (the county where a majority of Newmont's Nevada operations are located)[29] made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper.[30] This prompted the state legislature to call for "emergency regulations" to disallow some tax deductions.[31]
In April 2011, it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions, which had been approved by the Nevada Tax Commission.[30] The outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years.[27] This is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees, such as Robert J Miller, who served a director of Newmont Mining Corporation right after being Governor of Nevada for a decade.[30][not in citation given] Miller was succeeded by the late Kenny Guinn, who proposed a tax restructuring during the 2003 legislative session that was met with opposition from anti-tax business groups and many anti-tax Republicans.[citation needed]
FIN 48 an interpretation of FASB 109 requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities (or litigation).[32]
The 76th Session of the Nevada Legislature (2011), passed Senate Bill 493, over opposition from the mining industry. Senate Bill 493 "...creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, a seven-member panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation. An amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes." Some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections: "'If you don’t let us deduct this, we’ll deduct something else.'" A Newmont Mining Corp. staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction, saying employee housing cut travel costs." [27] The mines in Nevada were to report their deductions to the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, which was created under S.B. 493.[citation needed]
Batu Hijau mine, Indonesia[edit]
On 6 August 2010, a 5 day long strike, which had completely shut US-based Newmont Mining Corp.’s Batu Hijau mines and operations on Sumbawa Island ended after some 1,500 miners of the PT NNT labour union, affiliated to the Chemical, Energy, Mine Workers’ Union of the Indonesia Workers’ Union, agreed to await an overtime pay judgment from a provincial government. "The dispute started some three weeks after the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry of West Nusa Tenggara Province issued an order that management was in arrears on Rp 126 billion (US$13.8 million) in overtime wages to some 1,919 workers dating back to 2008." [33]

Yanacocha mine, Peru[edit]




The "Minera Yanacocha" gold mine near Cajamarca (Peru)


The Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru is considered one of the largest and most profitable in the world, producing over US$7 billion worth of gold to date. Before 1994 the mine was co-owned by Newmont, Buenaventura (a Peruvian mining company), and Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), a French government-owned company. This partnership collapsed in 1994 after BRGM tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an Australian company which was a rival of Newmont. Newmont and Buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade.
Larry Kurlander, then a senior executive at Newmont, claimed the French President Jacques Chirac had sent a letter to then Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the French owned company. Kurlander had been sent by Newmont to Peru to try to get a favorable outcome for Newmont in the dispute. The legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the Peruvian Supreme Court.
During this period Kurlander acknowledges having met with Vladimiro Montesinos, the Peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement, illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, influence peddling and bribing TV stations. [4] [5] However, Kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the French government were taking similar steps in trying to contact Montesinos. The French ambassador to Peru Antoine Blanca denies this, pointing to the fact that Montesinos was on the CIA payroll and thus would naturally side with the U.S-based company.
After the fall of Fujimori in 2000 a number of videos Montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged. In October 2005 Frontline in co-production with The New York Times found a February 1998 recording of a telephone conversation between Montesinos and Kurlander. The following is an excerpt from the tape:

Kurlander:...we have a very serious problem in Peru with our company (Newmont) and Minera Buenaventura so I have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities. I need it especially because the other side (the French government) has been acting quite strangely.


Montesinos (to interpreter): Tell him that I am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the French, as well as the problem he has with the judiciary.


Kurlander: So now you have a friend for life. I want a friend for life.


Montesinos (to interpreter): I thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend. Tell him I'm going to help him with the voting. I would like to know the tricky practices of the French. The French Connection!


Kurlander: The French Connection!


(laughter) [34]

Along with this telephone conversation, Frontline and The New York Times also re-broadcast three other videos. One was filmed in April 1998 and shows Montesinos talking to "Don Arabian", the CIA station chief in Peru, in an attempt to get CIA to pressure the U.S. to back Newmont in the case. In the video Montesinos claims to have found e-mails from Paris to Peru of French officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to France.
Another video recorded in May 1998 shows Montesinos meeting with Peruvian Supreme Court Justice, and former classmate, Jaime Beltran Quiroga. In it Montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between Newmont and BRGM. He tells Quiroga that if the decision goes to Newmont that the United States will back Peru in its border dispute with Ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the Cenepa War. He also tells Quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press. Quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case, his vote would be the deciding vote in the Newmont victory. After the video was first broadcast in Peru in 2001, on a Peruvian local television station the French Ambassador Antoine Blanca was quoted as saying "Now I know why Newmont won".
In the final July 1999 video, Montesinos is again seen with the now departing CIA station chief "Don Arabian" giving him a gift and thanking him for the help he has given Peru stating "[W]e hope that when you're back their [in Washington] you'll remember your friends".
Buyat Bay, Sulawesi, Indonesia[edit]
In August 2004, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment filed a US$133.6 million civil lawsuit against Newmont,[35] claiming tailings from the company's Minahasa Raya mine polluted Buyat Bay in the North Sulawesi province, contaminating local fish stocks and causing nearby villagers to become seriously ill. Newmont denied the allegations, arguing that the illnesses had more to do with poor hygiene and poverty. On November 15, 2005, a South Jakarta court dismissed the suit on technical grounds, saying the government had breached the terms of its contract with Newmont when it took legal action before seeking arbitration. Environmentalists urged for the suit to be appealed, but on December 1, 2005, Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar said the government expected to reach an out-of-court settlement with Newmont's local subsidiary. "By negotiating a settlement, we hope to be able to quickly compensate people living near the mine," he said. The government negotiating team was led by chief Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie. On February 16, 2006, the Indonesian government announced it would settle the civil suit for US$30 million to be paid over the next 10 years. The agreement also includes increased scientific monitoring and enhanced community development programs for the North Sulawesi province.
With the civil lawsuit settled, attention focused on the criminal charges against President Director Richard Ness. In December 2006, Newmont Mining Corp. objected to a documentary entitled Bye Bye Buyat being nominated for Indonesia's top film award, FFI's Citra Award. The company said that it interfered with Ness' ongoing trial.[36]
After a 21-month trial—one of the longest proceedings in Indonesian history—Ness was found innocent of the pollution charges on April 24, 2007.[37] The court found that the company was in compliance with all regulations and permits during its operations at the site, and failed to find evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Nemont's subsidiary had polluted Buyat Bay. At the end of May, the prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.[37]
A week after being found not guilty of criminal charges, Richard Ness sued The New York Times in Indonesian court for libel. The lawsuit asks for nearly US$65 million in damages, and that The New York Times print a page-one retraction of previously published articles.[38] In October 2007 an Indonesian court threw out the suit stating it was not within their jurisdiction. The case was being appealed.[39]
Akyem, Ghana[edit]
Newmont received the 2009 Public Eye award for its Akyem project in Ghana. According to the jury it had destroyed unique natural habitats, carried out forced resettlement of local people and polluted soil and rivers.[40] Newmont described the information as misleading and said the project had been extensively studied by international and national environmental experts, members of the local communities, and by the appropriate governmental agencies and departments.[41]
In January 2010, Ghanaian authorities brought a lawsuit against Newmont Mining for a reported US$4.9 million.[42]. The lawsuit accused Newmont of negligently spilling cyanide at its Ahafo gold mine in October 2009, resulting in water contamination and fish kills.[43] Newmont disputed the accusation, but agreed in March 2010 to pay compensation "in accordance with the law".[44]

History[edit]




William Boyce Thompson, founder of Newmont Mining


Early years[edit]
Newmont Mining Corporation was founded in 1916 in New York by Colonel William Boyce Thompson as a holding company to invest in Worldwide mineral, oil, and related companies. According to company lore, the name "Newmont" is a portmanteau "New York" and "Montana", reflecting where Thompson made his fortune and where he grew up.[6]
In 1929, Newmont became a mining company with its first gold product in by acquiring California's Empire Star Mine. By 1939, Newmont was operating 12 gold mines in North America.
The company acquired interests overseas. For decades around the middle of the 20th century, Newmont had a controlling interest in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia and in the O'Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand, South Africa.
Beginning in 1925, Newmont acquired interests in a Texas oil field. Eventually, Newmont's oil interests included more than 70 blocks in the Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico area and oil and gas production in the North Sea.
Newmont discovered the world's first submicroscopic or "invisible" gold at Carlin, Nevada in the early 1960s and began production on the first open pit gold mine in the world. The "Carlin Trend" or "Carlin Unconformity" is the largest gold discovery in North America during the 20th century. In 1971 Newmont began using the heap leaching technology on sub-mill grade ores there.
In the 1980s, Newmont thwarted five takeover bids – from Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold), T. Boone Pickens, Minorco, Hanson Industries and Sir James Goldsmith – who sought to break Newmont apart and sell its assets to increase shareholder value.
Major growth[edit]
After 1987, the company undertook major restructuring. This included the payment of a US$33 per share dividend to all shareholders for a total of US$2.2 billion, of which US$1.75 billion was borrowed. To reduce this debt the company undertook a divestment program involving all of its copper, oil, gas, and coal interests.
As a further step in the restructuring, the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Denver in 1988. A decade later, Newmont Mining Corporation and Newmont Gold Company combined assets to form a unified worldwide gold company. Shareholders of both companies had identical interests in the reserves, production and earnings of Newmont Gold's operations.
Newmont then merged with Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation (a former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway subsidiary, sold in preparation for the merger that produced the BNSF Railway[7]) to form North America's largest gold producer.
On June 21, 2000, Newmont announced a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. The merger was completed in January 2001.
In February 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Normandy Mining Limited and Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited. Newmont faced competition in its bid for Normandy from AngloGold. By eventually outbiding the South African company, Newmont became the world's largest gold producer, with an annual production in excess of 8 million ounces.[8]
In 2007, the company eliminated its 1.5 million ounce legacy hedge book to make Newmont the world’s largest unhedged gold producer. The following year, Newmont acquired Miramar Mining Corporation and its Hope Bay deposit in the Canadian Arctic.
In late 2008, Newmont moved its headquarters from Denver to the suburb of Greenwood Village, Colorado.[9]
In 2009, Newmont purchased the remaining one-third interest in Boddington Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti, bringing its ownership to 100 percent.
In April 2011, the company acquired Canada's Fronteer Gold Inc. for Cdn $2.3 billion. This made the company the world's second-largest gold producer.[10]
Operations and major projects[edit]

Nevada[edit]
As of 2011, Newmont’s Nevada 14 open-pit and four underground operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend; the Phoenix gold/copper mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of Golconda; and the Midas mine, near the town of the same name. It also participates in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
With the acquisition of Fronteer Gold, over sixty additional projects were added to the Newmont portfolio. The flagship property, Long Canyon, is located on a gold trend that is similar to the Carlin Trend in terms of its characteristics and potential.
Colorado[edit]
In August 2015, Newmont purchased the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti. The mine is the largest gold and silver producer in the state of Colorado.[11]
Yanacocha, Peru[edit]
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interest held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha’s mining rights consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines: Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. In addition, reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San Jose and Maqui Maqui are currently underway.
Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million ounces (750,000 attributable ounces). As of December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2011, Newmont’s board of directors granted approval to develop the Conga Project, located in the provinces of Celendín, and Sorochuco Huasmín districts and Cajamarca district of Encañada. Newmont’s ownership interest is identical to Yanacocha. If all permits are secured, the commencement of production is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.[12]
In 2015, agents acting on behalf of Newmont Mining Corporation attacked and beat a woman who refused to move from her home to allow for the development of a mine.
Indigenous Peruvian farmworker Maxima Acuña de Chaupe withstood violent eviction attempts, beatings, and a legal battle to protect her land from being turned into an open-pit gold mine[13]

Australia[edit]
Newmont acquired its Australian assets with the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002.[17][18]
Boddington. Newmont’s newest Australian asset is Boddington, which is now Australia's largest gold producer. It has been wholly owned since June 2009, when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010. As of year-end 2010, it reported 20.3 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves.
Tanami. The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites.
The Tanami operations have been wholly owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests. Operations today are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold. As of December 31, 2010, it had a reported 2.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest.




The Super Pit gold mine


In 2010, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold (377,000 attributable ounces). It reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves on December 31, 2010.
New Zealand[edit]
Newmont acquired its Waihi assets as part of the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002. The Waihi operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves at the end of the year.
Martha. The Martha Mine operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. The open pit mine has operated over historic underground gold mine workings since 1988.
Favona. The Favona underground mine began extracting ore at the end of 2006.
Batu Hijau, Sumbawa, Indonesia[edit]




Haul trucks at the Batu Hijau open pit, 2009


Newmont operates the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa in the Indonesia in the province of West Nusa Tenggara through its subsidiary company P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara which is a joint venture between Newmont, Sumitomo Corporation and P.T. Pukuafu Indah.
Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced 542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable ounces). On December 31, 2010, it reported 3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and 3.7 million ounces of gold reserves.
In 2008, the Indonesian government threatened to terminate the contract of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara after accusing it of failing to meet its divestment obligations. On April 1, 2009, international arbitrators and its partner sided with Newmont rejecting Jakarta's request to have their contract revoked, which would have forced the company to walk away from the property without any compensation. Instead Newmont was forced to sell a 17% stake in an Indonesian subsidiary within 180 days.[19]
In 2011, subsidiaries of Newmont and Sumitomo Corporation divested a 7 percent investment in PTNNT. Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), designated as the buyer by the Indonesian Government, signed a sale and purchase agreement for the shares worth $246.8 million. Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V., which holds Newmont’s shares in PTNNT – together with shares held by a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan – now owns 49 percent of PTNNT. Of that amount, Newmont will directly own 27.56 percent of PTNNT and has another 17 percent economic interest through financing arrangements with existing shareholders.[20]
Ghana[edit]
The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Newmont operates four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010.
Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010, reported 10.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Additionally, Newmont’s Akyem Mine (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In January 2010, Newmont received the mining lease. After close to two years of construction, the Akyem mine commenced commercial production in late 2013.
At December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves.
Other operations[edit]
Mexico[edit]
Newmont has a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura produced 174,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, it had 2.3 million ounces of gold reserves.
Former operations[edit]
Newmont has purchased and sold a number of operations in recent years:

Golden Grove Mine: Owned by Normandy Mining Limited since 1991, Golden Grove was acquired by Newmont Australia Ltd in February 2002 when Newmont took over Normandy.[21] Newmont sold on the mine to Oxiana Limited in June 2005 for A$265 million.[22]
Pajingo: Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Townsville, Queensland and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. Newmont sold the mine in late 2007; it is now owned by Conquest Mining.
Bronzewing Gold Mine: View Resources purchased the mine in July 2004 from Newmont for A$9.0 million, a package that also included the McClure mining operation, 8 km west of Bronzewing.[23]
Wiluna Gold Mine: Also part of the Normandy acquisition, Gowit Limited, later Agincourt Resources, purchased the mine on 10 December 2003 from Newmont for shares and $3.65 million in cash.[24][25]
Zarafshan: Newmont was part of a joint venture gold project in Uzbekistan, the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A difficult place to operate, Uzbekistan expropriates the company’s assets in 2006.
Kori Kollo: The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont had an 88% interest. The remaining 12% was owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owned and operated the mine. On July 23, 2009, Newmont announced the transfer of its interest in Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., which owned the Kori Kollo gold mine and Kori Chaca gold mine, to Compania Procesadora de Minerales S.A. ("CPM"), a company controlled by Newmont's long-time Bolivian partner Jose Mercado.
Minahasa: Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004.
Golden Giant: Newmont's Canadian operations previously included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) was located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon, Ontario, Canada, and had been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout most of 2006.
Holloway: Holloway was located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson, Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant. It was in production since 1996. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.
Empire-Star: Located in Grass Valley, California, the mine has been closed since 1957

Controversies[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (January 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Nevada operations[edit]
In July 2009, the Mine Safety and Health Administration announced that four supervisors for the Denver-based mining company have agreed to pay a combined $60,000 in individual penalties for their role in the accident at the Midas Mine north of Elko in June 2007. The agency said managers "showed a disregard for the miners' welfare" and acted with "more than ordinary negligence" before the victim fell through a sinkhole while operating a large loader about 200 feet below the entrance of the mine." [26]
State tax deductions[edit]
In March 2011, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval replaced his director of taxation, citing problems in auditing tax deductions.[27] Statements by both Nevada Mining Association President Tim Crowley[28] and Republican Assembly Minority Floor Leader Pete Goicoechea of Eureka County in Nevada (the county where a majority of Newmont's Nevada operations are located)[29] made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper.[30] This prompted the state legislature to call for "emergency regulations" to disallow some tax deductions.[31]
In April 2011, it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions, which had been approved by the Nevada Tax Commission.[30] The outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years.[27] This is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees, such as Robert J Miller, who served a director of Newmont Mining Corporation right after being Governor of Nevada for a decade.[30][not in citation given] Miller was succeeded by the late Kenny Guinn, who proposed a tax restructuring during the 2003 legislative session that was met with opposition from anti-tax business groups and many anti-tax Republicans.[citation needed]
FIN 48 an interpretation of FASB 109 requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities (or litigation).[32]
The 76th Session of the Nevada Legislature (2011), passed Senate Bill 493, over opposition from the mining industry. Senate Bill 493 "...creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, a seven-member panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation. An amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes." Some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections: "'If you don’t let us deduct this, we’ll deduct something else.'" A Newmont Mining Corp. staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction, saying employee housing cut travel costs." [27] The mines in Nevada were to report their deductions to the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, which was created under S.B. 493.[citation needed]
Batu Hijau mine, Indonesia[edit]
On 6 August 2010, a 5 day long strike, which had completely shut US-based Newmont Mining Corp.’s Batu Hijau mines and operations on Sumbawa Island ended after some 1,500 miners of the PT NNT labour union, affiliated to the Chemical, Energy, Mine Workers’ Union of the Indonesia Workers’ Union, agreed to await an overtime pay judgment from a provincial government. "The dispute started some three weeks after the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry of West Nusa Tenggara Province issued an order that management was in arrears on Rp 126 billion (US$13.8 million) in overtime wages to some 1,919 workers dating back to 2008." [33]

Yanacocha mine, Peru[edit]




The "Minera Yanacocha" gold mine near Cajamarca (Peru)


The Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru is considered one of the largest and most profitable in the world, producing over US$7 billion worth of gold to date. Before 1994 the mine was co-owned by Newmont, Buenaventura (a Peruvian mining company), and Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), a French government-owned company. This partnership collapsed in 1994 after BRGM tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an Australian company which was a rival of Newmont. Newmont and Buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade.
Larry Kurlander, then a senior executive at Newmont, claimed the French President Jacques Chirac had sent a letter to then Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the French owned company. Kurlander had been sent by Newmont to Peru to try to get a favorable outcome for Newmont in the dispute. The legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the Peruvian Supreme Court.
During this period Kurlander acknowledges having met with Vladimiro Montesinos, the Peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement, illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, influence peddling and bribing TV stations. [4] [5] However, Kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the French government were taking similar steps in trying to contact Montesinos. The French ambassador to Peru Antoine Blanca denies this, pointing to the fact that Montesinos was on the CIA payroll and thus would naturally side with the U.S-based company.
After the fall of Fujimori in 2000 a number of videos Montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged. In October 2005 Frontline in co-production with The New York Times found a February 1998 recording of a telephone conversation between Montesinos and Kurlander. The following is an excerpt from the tape:

Kurlander:...we have a very serious problem in Peru with our company (Newmont) and Minera Buenaventura so I have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities. I need it especially because the other side (the French government) has been acting quite strangely.


Montesinos (to interpreter): Tell him that I am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the French, as well as the problem he has with the judiciary.


Kurlander: So now you have a friend for life. I want a friend for life.


Montesinos (to interpreter): I thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend. Tell him I'm going to help him with the voting. I would like to know the tricky practices of the French. The French Connection!


Kurlander: The French Connection!


(laughter) [34]

Along with this telephone conversation, Frontline and The New York Times also re-broadcast three other videos. One was filmed in April 1998 and shows Montesinos talking to "Don Arabian", the CIA station chief in Peru, in an attempt to get CIA to pressure the U.S. to back Newmont in the case. In the video Montesinos claims to have found e-mails from Paris to Peru of French officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to France.
Another video recorded in May 1998 shows Montesinos meeting with Peruvian Supreme Court Justice, and former classmate, Jaime Beltran Quiroga. In it Montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between Newmont and BRGM. He tells Quiroga that if the decision goes to Newmont that the United States will back Peru in its border dispute with Ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the Cenepa War. He also tells Quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press. Quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case, his vote would be the deciding vote in the Newmont victory. After the video was first broadcast in Peru in 2001, on a Peruvian local television station the French Ambassador Antoine Blanca was quoted as saying "Now I know why Newmont won".
In the final July 1999 video, Montesinos is again seen with the now departing CIA station chief "Don Arabian" giving him a gift and thanking him for the help he has given Peru stating "[W]e hope that when you're back their [in Washington] you'll remember your friends".
Buyat Bay, Sulawesi, Indonesia[edit]
In August 2004, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment filed a US$133.6 million civil lawsuit against Newmont,[35] claiming tailings from the company's Minahasa Raya mine polluted Buyat Bay in the North Sulawesi province, contaminating local fish stocks and causing nearby villagers to become seriously ill. Newmont denied the allegations, arguing that the illnesses had more to do with poor hygiene and poverty. On November 15, 2005, a South Jakarta court dismissed the suit on technical grounds, saying the government had breached the terms of its contract with Newmont when it took legal action before seeking arbitration. Environmentalists urged for the suit to be appealed, but on December 1, 2005, Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar said the government expected to reach an out-of-court settlement with Newmont's local subsidiary. "By negotiating a settlement, we hope to be able to quickly compensate people living near the mine," he said. The government negotiating team was led by chief Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie. On February 16, 2006, the Indonesian government announced it would settle the civil suit for US$30 million to be paid over the next 10 years. The agreement also includes increased scientific monitoring and enhanced community development programs for the North Sulawesi province.
With the civil lawsuit settled, attention focused on the criminal charges against President Director Richard Ness. In December 2006, Newmont Mining Corp. objected to a documentary entitled Bye Bye Buyat being nominated for Indonesia's top film award, FFI's Citra Award. The company said that it interfered with Ness' ongoing trial.[36]
After a 21-month trial—one of the longest proceedings in Indonesian history—Ness was found innocent of the pollution charges on April 24, 2007.[37] The court found that the company was in compliance with all regulations and permits during its operations at the site, and failed to find evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Nemont's subsidiary had polluted Buyat Bay. At the end of May, the prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.[37]
A week after being found not guilty of criminal charges, Richard Ness sued The New York Times in Indonesian court for libel. The lawsuit asks for nearly US$65 million in damages, and that The New York Times print a page-one retraction of previously published articles.[38] In October 2007 an Indonesian court threw out the suit stating it was not within their jurisdiction. The case was being appealed.[39]
Akyem, Ghana[edit]
Newmont received the 2009 Public Eye award for its Akyem project in Ghana. According to the jury it had destroyed unique natural habitats, carried out forced resettlement of local people and polluted soil and rivers.[40] Newmont described the information as misleading and said the project had been extensively studied by international and national environmental experts, members of the local communities, and by the appropriate governmental agencies and departments.[41]
In January 2010, Ghanaian authorities brought a lawsuit against Newmont Mining for a reported US$4.9 million.[42]. The lawsuit accused Newmont of negligently spilling cyanide at its Ahafo gold mine in October 2009, resulting in water contamination and fish kills.[43] Newmont disputed the accusation, but agreed in March 2010 to pay compensation "in accordance with the law".[44]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
