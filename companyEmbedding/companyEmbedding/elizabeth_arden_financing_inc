Additional Information


Product Details

Leveraging more than 25 years of research, Elizabeth Arden has updated the existing Ceramide Eye Capsule formula, adding 9 new ingredients to not only replenish essential, naturally-occurring lipids, but also help support skin’s natural renewal process and target the key signs of aging around the eyes for a younger and brighter look. The result is a serum that immediately enhances skin’s natural barrier, increases moisturization within the surface of the skin, and minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Did you know?
The eye contour has the thinnest, most fragile skin on the entire face*. Advanced Ceramide Eye Capsules are formulated specifically for the delicate skin around the eye and to target visible imperfections such as crow’s feet, crepiness and puffiness.
Precise. Potent. Targeted for Eyes.
Each golden capsule is biodegradable, fragrance and preservative-free—designed to deliver a fresh, concentrated dose of moisture-boosting serum packed with even more advanced Ceramide technology than before.

Clinically tested to improve the look of2:
Crow’s feet, fine lines and wrinkles
Firmness and elasticity
Skin texture and clarity
Puffiness 
Undereye discolorations

Elizabeth Arden, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2013 Results







Share














Business Wirevia The Motley Fool, AOL.com
Aug 8th 2013 7:11AM




Elizabeth Arden, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2013 Results~ Fiscal 2013 Net Sales of $1.345 Billion ~~ Increase of 8.6%; 9.6% at Constant Rates ~NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Elizabeth Arden, Inc.  (NAS: RDEN) , a global prestige beauty products company, today announced financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.FISCAL 2013 RESULTSFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, the Company reported net sales of $1.345 billion or an increase of 8.6% as compared to the prior fiscal year. At constant rates, net sales increased by 9.6%. On a reported basis, net income per diluted share was $1.33. On an adjusted basis, net income per diluted share was $2.14, as compared to net income per diluted share of $2.07 for the prior year period. Adjusted net income per diluted share excludes non-recurring costs relating to the Elizabeth Arden repositioning and the fiscal 2012 fragrance brand acquisitions. A reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted results can be found in the tables and footnotes at the end of this press release.In North America, net sales increased 10.2% over the prior fiscal year, and net sales for the Company's international segment increased by 8.4% (at constant rates). Net sales of fragrances in the international segment increased 14% (at constant rates) for fiscal 2013 behind the Company's Western European fragrance initiative and expansion into new markets.The Company continued to see success with the Elizabeth Arden repositioning. Retail sales at the Company's Elizabeth Arden flagship counters have increased 20% in North America year over year since conversion, and retail sales at the Company's international flagship doors have increased 17% in the aggregate since conversion. These increases are driven by the retail sales performance of skin care and color products.E. Scott Beattie, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Elizabeth Arden, Inc., commented, "There were two primary factors that caused our sales and earnings results to be below our expectations in fiscal 2013. The first was due to weakness at one of our largest North American mass retail customers, both in terms of retail sales performance and replenishment rate. The second factor was that are growth projections for the Elizabeth Arden brand proved to be overly optimistic given the complexity and scope of transition underway for the brand repositioning. We remain confident in our repositioning efforts and, in fact, are accelerating the execution of the Elizabeth Arden brand repositioning. We expect to incur the final phase of repositioning expenses, including eliminating pre-repositioned product inventory and exiting unprofitable doors, in fiscal 2014. While resulting in near term charges, this is expected to drive improved performance of the Elizabeth Arden brand going forward. Separately, we are taking steps to improve efficiencies in our sales organizations and in the overall indirect overhead structure."Mr. Beattie continued, "While this was a transitional year for our company, we did make good progress driving both our Western European fragrance initiative and significantly enhancing the future prospects of the Elizabeth Arden brand through the brand repositioning. We also integrated the fragrance brands acquired late in fiscal 2012, grew our category-leading market share of fragrances at mass retail in North America, opened affiliates in new markets, including Brazil and Germany, and restructured our business in China."Mr. Beattie concluded, "Our priorities remain to accelerate the global growth of the Elizabeth Arden brand, expand sales of our fragrance portfolio, particularly internationally, and continue to drive operational efficiencies. Many of the initiatives we are undertaking to expand our business, while not accretive in fiscal 2014, are important to drive future growth. I am confident that with the acquisitions and restructuring activities, including those associated with the Elizabeth Arden brand repositioning, behind us and more conservative forward guidance, we will return to systematic improvement in gross margins, EBITDA margins and return on invested capital."FOURTH QUARTER RESULTSFor the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2013, the Company reported net sales of $267.6 million, or an increase of 0.8%, as compared to the prior year period. At constant rates, net sales increased by 1.2%. On a reported basis, net loss per diluted share was $0.17. On an adjusted basis, net income per diluted share was $0.10, as compared to net income per diluted share of $0.28 for the prior year period. Adjusted net income per diluted share excludes non-recurring costs as noted above.During the fourth quarter, the Company experienced lower than expected replenishment orders from one of its key North American mass retail customers, effectively reducing their inventory on hand with orders significantly below their pace of their retail sales of the Company's products. The replenishment rate at this account worsened significantly in the month of June. The impact from this customer, coupled with weak performance in Europe, particularly in the UK, caused the fourth quarter and full year earnings results to be below the expectations communicated last May. The remainder of the Company's business largely performed as expected.OUTLOOKThe Company's guidance for fiscal 2014 reflects more modest expectations regarding the overall Elizabeth Arden brand repositioning, uncertain economic conditions globally and the quarterly variability of all of the Company's initiatives to drive future revenue growth and market share, which span across the Company's businesses and geographies. In addition, based on current foreign currency rates, foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact fiscal 2014 results.For the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, the Company expects net sales to increase by 3.0% to 5.0%, including an expected unfavorable impact from foreign currency of approximately 1.0%, as compared to the prior year period, and for earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.30. The earnings guidance includes a negative impact of $0.19 per share resulting from foreign currency translation as compared to rates in effect for fiscal 2013.For the first quarter of fiscal 2014 ending September 30, 2013, the Company expects sales to be flat to down 1% in comparison to the prior year period, including an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 1.0%, and for adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.18.The gross margin and earnings guidance excludes all non-recurring expenses. In fiscal 2014, the Company expects to incur non-recurring expenses of $11 million to $16 million for the Elizabeth Arden repositioning, approximately $7.5 million of which is expected to be incurred in the first quarter. The Elizabeth Arden repositioning costs primarily relate to product changeover charges and exiting unprofitable doors. Additionally, the Company expects to incur approximately $5 million for restructuring and severance charges, $3.5 million of which is expected to be incurred in the first quarter.The Company notes that continued global economic uncertainty may have a negative effect on retailer and consumer confidence and demand, and, along with the foreign currency volatility, makes forecasting difficult.CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATIONThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, August 8, 2013 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. All interested parties can listen to a live web cast of the Company's conference call by visiting the Investor Relations section of the Corporate tab on the Company's web site at http://ir.elizabetharden.com.

EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to income from operations or net income (loss) (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)) as a measure of our operating performance or to net cash provided by operating, investing and financing activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs. We believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as a measure of a company's operating performance and debt servicing ability because it assists in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to capital structure, depreciation and amortization or non-operating factors (such as historical cost). Accordingly, as a result of our capital structure, we believe EBITDA is a relevant measure. This information has been disclosed here to permit a more complete comparative analysis of our operating performance relative to other companies and of our debt servicing ability. EBITDA may not, however, be comparable in all instances to other similar types of measures. We have also disclosed EBITDA as adjusted without giving effect to acquisition-related and Elizabeth Arden repositioning costs. This disclosure is being provided for comparability purposes because we believe it is meaningful to our investors and other interested parties to understand the EBITDA performance of the Company on a consistent basis without regard to the effect of acquisition-related and Elizabeth Arden repositioning costs.The table below reconciles net (loss) income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA and to EBITDA as adjusted: (For a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA for prior periods, see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which can be found on our website at www.elizabetharden.com.)(Amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended Twelve Months EndedJune 30,2013 June 30,2012June 30,2013  June 30,2012Net (loss) income$(5,009)$3,625$40,711$57,419Plus:(Benefit from) Provision for income taxes(5,863)(202)6,94016,093Interest expense, net5,7945,42024,30921,759Depreciation related to cost of goods sold1,7121,4076,3865,257Depreciation and amortization10,8287,36439,58328,797EBITDA7,46217,614117,929129,325Non-recurring costs (c)14,3837,10838,7857,108EBITDA, as adjusted$21,845$24,722$156,714$136,433The table below reconciles net cash flow provided by operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA:(Amounts in thousands) Twelve Months EndedJune 30,2013 June 30,2012 Net cash provided by operating activities$62,091$58,524Changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions30,50848,016Interest expense, net24,30921,759Amortization of senior note offering and credit facility costs(1,367)(1,247)Provision for income taxes6,94016,093Deferred income taxes1,055(8,763)Amortization of share-based awards(5,607)(5,057) EBITDA$117,929$129,325(b) The table below reconciles the calculation of (i) gross profit and net (loss) income and (ii) net (loss) income per share on a basic and diluted basis from the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP to such amounts before giving effect to non-recurring costs related to the Elizabeth Arden brand repositioning and our 2012 fragrance license acquisitions. This disclosure is being provided for comparability purposes because we believe it is meaningful to our investors and other interested parties to understand our operating performance on a consistent basis without regard to the effect of such non-recurring costs.

E. Scott Beattie


Maintaining an Entrepreneurial Mindset


An Interview with E. Scott Beattie, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Elizabeth Arden, Inc.


Editors’ NoteE. Scott Beattie has been involved in every element of the Elizabeth Arden’s expansion and development since 1992. Additionally, Beattie has been involved in the financing, management, and development of a number of private and publicly traded businesses in the consumer product, financial services, information technology, and retailing sectors through Bedford Capital, a Toronto-based private equity firm he co-founded in 1989. Prior to that, he served as a vice president in the Mergers and Acquisitions group of Merrill Lynch, Inc. and as a manager of Accenture Consulting.
Company BriefAs a global prestige beauty products company with an extensive portfolio of prestige beauty brands sold in over 100 countries, Elizabeth Arden’s (www.elizabetharden.com) brand portfolio includes Elizabeth Arden skin care, color, and fragrance products, including the Ceramide, Eight Hour, Visible Difference, and Prevage skin care lines; the celebrity fragrance brands of Britney Spears, Elizabeth Taylor, Mariah Carey, Taylor Swift, and Usher; the designer fragrance brands of Juicy Couture, Alberta Ferretti, Alfred Sung, Bob Mackie, Geoffrey Beene, Halston, John Varvatos, Kate Spade, Lucky Brand, and Rocawear; and the lifestyle fragrance brands Curve, Giorgio Beverly Hills, and PS Fine Cologne.
How critical has innovation been to the culture and success of Elizabeth Arden?
One of the key reasons Elizabeth Arden and the beauty industry has been such a dynamic, fast growing, resilient industry is there has been so much innovation. There are many different models, from very large businesses that have a structured model of innovation to entrepreneurs creating out-of-the-box innovation; we’re in between. We try to maintain that entrepreneurial mindset and manifest that through a very flat organization. We try to keep the number of organizational layers to a minimum so that there is a lot more cross-functional, horizontal communication and minimal hierarchical behavior.
I believe in cross-functional training for our executive team to reduce some of the bureaucracy and the mistakes that are often made because of it. It’s also more fulfilling for people in the organization to develop their skills across many functions. A flat organization creates a certain nimbleness and agility that allows you to take advantage of opportunities.
I’m so satisfied with how well we innovate that I’m trying to ensure that our organization brings the same kind of focus and passion to driving the growth of our existing brands.
How do you accomplish that without losing the tradition and history of the brand?
It is a challenge because people like to work on the newest things, and oftentimes, they take for granted brands such as Arden that have been around for many years. Overcoming that requires a combination of setting up the organizational structure to support both organic growth as well as new innovation and to reward people for that financially and through their career paths.
People that create even modest growth in a 20- or 30-year-old brand should get as much or more credit than someone taking a new product to market with a huge advertising budget behind it.
What key characteristics determine if a celebrity or designer is the right fit for your brand?
First, we assess the business acumen of the individual and the people around them, because if we’re going to get into a long-term relationship and invest capital to promote and distribute the brand, we want to know the partnership we have is with dedicated people.
Second, we focus on whether the popularity of that celebrity or designer translates into the beauty category.
They should also be global. Given the strong growth of the beauty business globally, some of the best opportunities for us in fragrance and skin care are outside of North America.
Is the messaging for a product consistent globally or is it locally targeted?
It tends to be more consistent. American brands are aspirational around the world. Even though there are cultural differences in how people interact with brands, a brand needs to be true to itself and its inherent DNA.
If a brand is American, it needs to be proud to be American and not adapt itself to be something else or the consumer connection is broken down.
With Arden’s clear brand recognition, do you foresee opportunities for extensions?
One we’re excited about is the spa industry, which is bigger than beauty globally and is exploding in many emerging markets, particularly in Asia.
When people are asked about the Elizabeth Arden brand, one of their first connections is to the Red Door Spa and its heritage. Elizabeth Arden is one of the few global brands in the spa industry.
We have a private equity group that licenses the Elizabeth Arden and Red Door marks for our spas and it’s primarily U.S.-based, but we see potential to expand it globally. That not only creates another business platform for the Arden brand that is complementary, but it gives us a differentiated way to interact with our customers – servicing people through a spa environment with professional skin care clinicians or beauty advisers, which creates a more loyal experience than just buying a product in a retail outlet. That has uniquely been our heritage for over 100 years.
How much can the Internet drive the business?
The biggest opportunity is still informational, because shopping behavior, especially for younger customers, is different. The days of walking in and out of stores has evolved into sitting in front of an iPad and scouring various brands and educating yourself about the attributes of the brands. 
They’ll then buy the product through our site, through Macy’s and other sites, or buy them in a store when they have time at lunch. We’re indifferent to the route they use to get to the product. The key is to build loyalty and educate the customer on what you stand for, particularly in emerging markets where there isn’t a lot of established retail distribution.
Where are your primary opportunities for growth?
We have significant market share in the U.S. where beauty sales per capita are less than in Europe and Asia. Both the European ($57 billion) and the Asian beauty markets ($53 billion) are twice the size of the North American market. These markets are growing faster and provide our company tremendous opportunity for growth. 
What is the value of being headquartered in Florida?
Florida was where we started and is the heart and soul of our culture, even though some of the functions have moved to other parts of the world as we’ve grown.
On the professional side, it’s an attractive place to live and work. The cost of living is more affordable, there are no state taxes, and it’s a nice lifestyle. There aren’t a lot of global consumer product companies, particularly in South Florida, so we have a great opportunity to attract the best people to work for us.•

Additional Information


Product Details

Leveraging more than 25 years of research, Elizabeth Arden has updated the existing Ceramide Eye Capsule formula, adding 9 new ingredients to not only replenish essential, naturally-occurring lipids, but also help support skin’s natural renewal process and target the key signs of aging around the eyes for a younger and brighter look. The result is a serum that immediately enhances skin’s natural barrier, increases moisturization within the surface of the skin, and minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Did you know?
The eye contour has the thinnest, most fragile skin on the entire face*. Advanced Ceramide Eye Capsules are formulated specifically for the delicate skin around the eye and to target visible imperfections such as crow’s feet, crepiness and puffiness.
Precise. Potent. Targeted for Eyes.
Each golden capsule is biodegradable, fragrance and preservative-free—designed to deliver a fresh, concentrated dose of moisture-boosting serum packed with even more advanced Ceramide technology than before.

Clinically tested to improve the look of2:
Crow’s feet, fine lines and wrinkles
Firmness and elasticity
Skin texture and clarity
Puffiness 
Undereye discolorations

I just love Fragrancex and have been purchasing from this online store for a number of years now. I have recommended the site to many people and they too are always extremely happy with their purchase. I even buy my son's aftershaves through Fragrancex!! I always get free delivery and as a loyal customer I also get an extra 10% discount of my purchases...... Yay!!!!

I order always on fragrance X because they are the best. The products are cheap but with an excellent quality. I wait only 6 days to have my products into my hands ,however i live in Europe. That's great. I recommend this website! Thanks to fragrance x. 








Florence G

I was very happy with my order placed with FragranceX.com and would recommend to any friend. I was kept updated on the progress of my items and they arrived well within time. I don't think I could have got much cheaper anywhere else and know and trust this site. Thank you!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
