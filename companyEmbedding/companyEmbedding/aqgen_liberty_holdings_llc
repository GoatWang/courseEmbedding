                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Genworth Divests Wealth Management Business  - Analyst Blog


September 04, 2013, 03:20:01 PM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

Genworth Financial, Inc

  . (
  GNW

  ) completed the divestiture of its Wealth Management business to
  AqGen Liberty Acquisition, Inc., for $412.5 million.
  


  Sale proceeds approximated $316 million net of transaction costs
  and payments to settle obligations to the former owners of its
  Altegris businesses. Genworth intends to deploy the proceeds
  along with cash balance to pay down the 2014 debt maturities.
  


  Genworth, in third quarter, expects to record additional
  after-tax loss of up to $10 million related to the divestiture.
  


  To better focus on capital generation, increase financial
  strength and flexibility of the company as well as simply the
  business model, Genworth decided to divest the wealth management
  business. The vend-off includes divesting Genworth Financial
  Wealth Management, and alternative solutions provider, the
  Altegris companies. As a result, it entered into an agreement end
  of March with AqGen Liberty Acquisition, Inc., a subsidiary of
  AqGen Liberty Holdings LLC, a partnership of Aquiline Capital
  Partners and Genstar Capital for the same.
  


  This divestiture also marks its heightened focus on core business
  and capital generation from a non-core business. In April last
  year, the company divested its tax and accounting financial
  advisor unit, Genworth Financial Investment Services (GFIS) to
  Cetera Financial Group for about $79 million plus contingent
  consideration
  


  Genworth Financial Wealth Management will continue to operate
  under its current brand name until an appropriate new name is
  announced later this year.
  


  Genworth has always remained focused to enhance its operational
  results. As such in June this year, Genworth Financial decided to
  sever 400 positions, of which 150 are not to be filled. Genworth
  will have $80 to $90 million in annual pre-tax expense savings
  when the plan is fully implemented.
  


  Genworth, in the last reported quarter, missed the Zacks
  Consensus Estimate after three straight quarter surprises.
  However, results were much above the year-ago level. Also, the
  average beat remains nearly 17%.  With sustained focus on
  strengthening its portfolio and a drive to enhance operational
  results, we expect it to regain the momentum.
  


  Genworth carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Life insurers
  China Life Insurance Co. Ltd.

  (
  LFC

  ),
  StanCorp Financial Group Inc.

  (
  SFG

  ) and
  Lincoln National Corporation

  (
  LNC

  ) carry favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and are worth
  considering.
