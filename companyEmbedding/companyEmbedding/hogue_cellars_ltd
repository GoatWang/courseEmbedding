2014 Genesis Meritage
The 2014 vintage of Genesis Meritage captures the best qualities of its components: Merlot brings black cherry fruit and a supple quality to the wine, while Malbec adds full-bodied complexity. Cabernet Sauvignon gives the wine its structure, and Petit Verdot contributes dense, dark fruit. Flavors are of rich black cherry, spicy oak, and a touch of orange zest, with vanilla spice on the finish. Tannins are
moderate. Serve with braised short ribs, rosemary-herbed lamb chops, or grilled T-bone steak

2015 Hogue Riesling
The 2015 Riesling reveals ripe aromas and flavors of apple and lime with subtle notes of peach and melon. The wine is crisp and well balanced with an off-dry style. Pair this fruit-driven, food-friendly wine with fresh pear and apple slices, hard cheeses with nuts, whitefish and other seafood dishes with low to moderate oil content, or spicy Thai cuisine.

2014 Genesis Meritage
The 2014 vintage of Genesis Meritage captures the best qualities of its components: Merlot brings black cherry fruit and a supple quality to the wine, while Malbec adds full-bodied complexity. Cabernet Sauvignon gives the wine its structure, and Petit Verdot contributes dense, dark fruit. Flavors are of rich black cherry, spicy oak, and a touch of orange zest, with vanilla spice on the finish. Tannins are
moderate. Serve with braised short ribs, rosemary-herbed lamb chops, or grilled T-bone steak

2015 Hogue Riesling
The 2015 Riesling reveals ripe aromas and flavors of apple and lime with subtle notes of peach and melon. The wine is crisp and well balanced with an off-dry style. Pair this fruit-driven, food-friendly wine with fresh pear and apple slices, hard cheeses with nuts, whitefish and other seafood dishes with low to moderate oil content, or spicy Thai cuisine.

   The Hogue family has lived off the land for more than 50 years, growing a wide assortment of crops durng that time, but Mike Hogue's experiment with grapes in 1979 marked the beginning of The Hogue Cellars. Today, the Washington State winery produces some 500,000 cases of wine per year under the Hogue, Genesis, and Reserve labels. Its offerings include cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, gewürztraminer, merlot, pinot grigio, and syrah. They are available in the US as well as abroad. Vincor purchased The Hogue Cellars in 2001. In 2006 Vincor and its subsidiaries, including Hogue, were acquired by Constellation Brands.

Hogue Cellars Ltd Revenue and Financial Data

   The Hogue family has lived off the land for more than 50 years, growing a wide assortment of crops durng that time, but Mike Hogue's experiment with grapes in 1979 marked the beginning of The Hogue Cellars. Today, the Washington State winery produces some 500,000 cases of wine per year under the Hogue, Genesis, and Reserve labels. Its offerings include cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, gewürztraminer, merlot, pinot grigio, and syrah. They are available in the US as well as abroad. Vincor purchased The Hogue Cellars in 2001. In 2006 Vincor and its subsidiaries, including Hogue, were acquired by Constellation Brands.

Hogue Cellars started in a child's playhouse in Mike Hogue's backyard and became one of the most recognized names in Washington wines. When Mike and Gary launched Hogue Cellars, it was Washington's 19th bonded winery.
Their father, Wayne, started hop farming in the Prosser area in 1944 and gradually grew their hop farm into more than 1,700 acres of mixed crops. By 1974, Mike used 6 acres from his father's land and planted Riesling grapes, which he sold to other wineries. Seven years later, Mike and a friend, started making wine in Mike's daughters playhouse, and it was "pretty darn good." In 1982 the Hogue brothers made their first appearance as "The Hogue Cellars" at the Prosser Wine & Food Fair, an event that is still going on today. That following year, The Hogue Cellars winery and tasting room took over a vacant building in Prosser, WA, where the tasting room still remains.
Constant awards and accolades grew the company from 2,000 cases in 1982 to 5,000 in 1983 to 10,000 in 1984. By 1996, an expansion project was completed boosting Hogue's production capacity to 400,000 cases.
Throughout the years, Hogue Cellars has maintained consistent quality and still only uses fruit harvested within the Columbia Valley and its subappellations.

2014 Genesis Meritage










The 2014 vintage of Genesis Meritage captures the best qualities of its components: Merlot brings black cherry fruit and a supple quality to the wine, while Malbec adds full-bodied complexity. Cabernet Sauvignon gives the wine its structure, and Petit Verdot contributes dense, dark fruit. Flavors are of rich black cherry, spicy oak, and a touch of orange zest, with vanilla spice on the finish. Tannins are
moderate. Serve with braised short ribs, rosemary-herbed lamb chops, or grilled T-bone steak

2016 Terroir Edelzwicker










The 2016 Edelzwicker was inspired by the original prestigious designation—including only noble varietals, such as Gewürztraminer,
Pinot Gris, Riesling, and Muscat Canelli. It displays refreshing green apple, lychee, lemon, and stone fruit. The palate is clean and crisp
with citrus, white flowers, and melon flavors. This well-balanced Alsatian-style blend has a wonderful medium-to-long finish.

2016 Terroir Viognier










In its native region of the northern Rhone in France, Viognier grows on baking hot south facing slopes above the river where it ripens perfectly.  One could imagine that it might be well suited to eastern Washington conditions. Here it develops melon and tropical fruit flavors overlain with a nice floral character.  The 2016 Viognier opens with aromas of peach, pear, and exotic fruits and fresh floral notes. The flavors are clean and crisp with soft acidity. The wine is very slightly sweet and pairs well with lightly oily seafood, spicy Asian cuisine, or goat cheese. It is also delicious enjoyed alone as an aperitif.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
