        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREWhen the Astros acquired Colin Moran in a trade two years ago, the former Iona Prep star immediately became their presumptive third baseman of the future. That future began Tuesday night in Chicago when Moran joined Houston for its series opener with the first-place White Sox.The 23-year old from Rye received his first big-league call-up Monday night, according to family and friends. His parents, Bill and Diane, flew to Chicago Tuesday morning. The move wasn't official until Tuesday afternoon when the Astros made three moves, highlighted by All-Star center fielder Carlos Gomez heading to the disabled list and Moran joining the roster."I kind of just think about all the times in the backyard with my dad and I think about all the different coaches I’ve been lucky enough to have," Moran told reporters. "Everything that went into this, it was hard not to get emotional and just try to soak it in."Iona Prep grad Colin Moran coveted by MLB teamsColin Moran: Following a baseball dreamColin Moran picked No. 6 overall by MarlinsTrade to Houston Astros a 'whirlwind' for Colin MoranThe sixth overall pick in the 2013 draft, Moran hit .288 with a .331 on-base percentage, three home runs and 22 RBI in 32 games this season with the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies. He is a career .299 hitter with a .356 on-base percentage in three minor-league seasons. According to MLB.com, Moran began the season as the No. 6 prospect in the Houston organization.“He isn’t flashy, he isn’t very loud, but he definitely goes about his business and does things on the field that are important," Houston general manager Jeff Luhnow told sportsradio610.com Tuesday. "He hits a lot of doubles. He hits for a high average. He fields all the balls that are thrown to him.

Manager A.J. Hinch told reporters he expects Moran to start Wednesday against right-hander Mat Latos.Once he debuts, Moran will become the third big-leaguer from his family, joining uncles B.J. and Rich Surhoff, who both starred at Rye High School. Rich, a right-handed pitcher, split the 1985 season with the Phillies and Rangers. B.J. played 19 seasons with the Brewers, Orioles and Braves after being selected as the first overall pick in the 1985 draft. When Moran was drafted three years ago, he became the highest pick from Westchester County since Surhoff.B.J. Surhoff's career statsRich Surhoff's career statsMoran followed in the footsteps of his uncle B.J. and his older brother, Brian, a 2009 seventh-round pick, and played collegiately at North Carolina. He debuted by winning the ACC's freshman of the year and then won the conference player of the year as a junior. He set the single-season RBI record that season and finished his career with 197 RBI in just 179 games. He was named one of three finalists for the 2013 Golden Spikes Award, which goes to college baseball's best player.Moran joined the Marlins' organization later that summer, but he was dealt at the trade deadline the following summer to the Astros, who had reportedly considered him as the No. 1 overall pick before tabbing pitcher Mark Appel. Houston acquired Moran, outfielder Jake Marsinick and minor-league pitcher Frances Martes for pitcher Jared Cosart, utilityman Kike Hernandez and outfield prospect Austin Wates.The Astros, who made the playoffs with a young team last year, have been the American League's biggest disappointment so far. Their 15-24 record is the second worst in the league.They have received little production from third base. Starter Luis Valbuena has the second-worst average (.208) and second-worst WAR (0.0) among the 25 qualified third basemen in baseball. Only the Yankees' Chase Headley has been worse."I can see Colin Moran being our third baseman next year and beyond," Luhnow said.Twitter: @lohudinsider

Astros option Colin Moran back to Class AAA Fresno

PHOENIX --- As the rest of his teammates showered, dressed and readied for a Monday night off, Colin Moran packed his bags for Albuquerque, N.M.
The Astros optioned Moran back to Class AAA Fresno after their 8-3 win against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field. The move corresponded with the pending return of center fielder Carlos Gomez, who will be activated before Tuesday afternoon's game.



Moran, 23, finished his first major-league stint, which spanned 13 days, with two hits in 19 at-bats. The left-handed hitting third baseman began his career 0 for 13 before breaking through with a two-hit, two-RBI game in Friday's loss in Anaheim.
"I'm glad he got his first hit out of the way," manager A.J. Hinch said. "He got to learn a little bit about how we operate up here. Next time he comes up, he'll be better for it."
The soft-spoken Moran said he was "thankful for the opportunity" and once with Fresno will "try and work my way back." The Class AAA affiliate begins a four-game series in Albuquerque on Tuesday night.

Houston Astros Highlights
 



"It was a good learning experience," Moran said.
Moran didn't play in Monday's game and probably would have seen limited playing time in the next 10 days as the Astros face a slew of lefthanders.
"He's ready to be a big leaguer. He's going to be an effective hitter for us,' Hinch said. "He played a pretty good third base while he was here. And he doesn't say a word. He's as quiet as they come. So, there's a lot to like about Colin Moran and when comes back he'll contribute quite a bit."

Astros third baseman Colin Moran has been placed on the 10-day DL after suffering a facial fracture in Saturday's 8-4 win over the Orioles, the team announced Sunday.
Moran suffered the gruesome injury in the sixth inning, when he fouled a pitch from Orioles pitcher Darren O'Day off his bat and straight into his eye area.

"It was a pretty scary incident," manager A.J. Hinch said Saturday. "I go on the field, and he's got blood on the face. Blood, it isn't generally seen in our sport."
Moran was obviously in pain and needed to leave the field on a cart. He went to a Baltimore hospital, where the facial fracture was diagnosed.
O'Day felt bad for the accident and said he hoped Moran recovers soon.
"I've had good friends who've had accidents like that and never knew if they were going to play again or didn't get to play again, so I hope he's OK," O'Day said, via ESPN. "But as a professional, you've got to try and block that out."

It's a tough blow for Moran, who was making his second start in the Majors.
The Astros called up Triple-A Fresno infielder Tyler White to take over Moran's spot on the roster.

Astros prospect Colin Moran shines in AAA All-Star Game

1 / 15


Back to Gallery
















Three Astros prospects participated in the AAA All-Star Game on Wednesday night in Tacoma, Wash., but one stood out above the rest.
Derek Fisher, Max Stassi and Colin Moran each served as Fresno's representatives for the Pacific Coast League in a 6-4 victory over the International League, and Moran got the scoring initiated for PCL.
Moran hit a solo homer in the bottom of the second inning off of righthanded Phillies prospect Tom Eshelman, tying the game at one. Eshelman was a 2015 draft pick of the Astros and was traded to Philadelphia as part of the deal to acquire closer Ken Giles. 



Moran struck again with a single in the fourth inning off Huntsville native and former Sam Houston State pitcher Caleb Smith. He would go on to score on a three-run homer by the Athletics' Renato Nunez. Moran struck out swinging against the Reds' Kevin Shackelford to end his night 2 for 4 in the seventh inning.
Fresno catcher Max Stassi replaced starter Carson Kelly in the fourth inning and singled on a 3-1 pitch from Smith in the bottom of the inning. Marlins catching prospect Tomás Telis replaced Stassi in the seventh inning, who finished the night 1 for 2.
The lone Rockies representative, Noel Cuevas, replaced Fisher in the sixth, who had a quiet All-Star Game and went 0 for 3. 


We're knotted at 1, thanks to this drive from the @FresnoGrizzlies' @morancolin92! @astros pic.twitter.com/7cnTJIB0Cl— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) July 13, 2017

Astros prospect Colin Moran shines in AAA All-Star Game

1 / 15


Back to Gallery
















Three Astros prospects participated in the AAA All-Star Game on Wednesday night in Tacoma, Wash., but one stood out above the rest.
Derek Fisher, Max Stassi and Colin Moran each served as Fresno's representatives for the Pacific Coast League in a 6-4 victory over the International League, and Moran got the scoring initiated for PCL.
Moran hit a solo homer in the bottom of the second inning off of righthanded Phillies prospect Tom Eshelman, tying the game at one. Eshelman was a 2015 draft pick of the Astros and was traded to Philadelphia as part of the deal to acquire closer Ken Giles. 



Moran struck again with a single in the fourth inning off Huntsville native and former Sam Houston State pitcher Caleb Smith. He would go on to score on a three-run homer by the Athletics' Renato Nunez. Moran struck out swinging against the Reds' Kevin Shackelford to end his night 2 for 4 in the seventh inning.
Fresno catcher Max Stassi replaced starter Carson Kelly in the fourth inning and singled on a 3-1 pitch from Smith in the bottom of the inning. Marlins catching prospect Tomás Telis replaced Stassi in the seventh inning, who finished the night 1 for 2.
The lone Rockies representative, Noel Cuevas, replaced Fisher in the sixth, who had a quiet All-Star Game and went 0 for 3.

Trade to Astros doesn’t change Colin Moran’s status as a top prospect
			By Evan Drellich
on January 29, 2015 at 9:42 PM

From any vantage, Colin Moran’s pro career has gotten off to an uncommon start.
To begin with, the Astros third-base prospect was a pretty high pick, No. 6 overall in the 2013 draft by the Miami Marlins. The 22-year-old was invited to big league camp in his first full year as a pro — a rare privilege afforded to only the best — and he was promptly traded halfway into the year, as part of the package the Marlins sent the Astros for righty Jarred Cosart and utility man Kiké Hernandez.
Usually, a team won’t surrender a high pick so soon into his career, and Moran acknowledges his surprise. The news came down right as the afternoon non-waiver trade deadline passed on July 31, with Moran catching first word not from the manager, but a teammate with an internet connection.
“We were in the locker room and someone just kind of said, they read it on Twitter, so it was kind of surprising,” Moran said of the trade. “I guess that’s just how it works now, Twitter being so quick.”
Moran is from the Metro New York area but carries a laid-back, calm demeanor that some scouts would call “low-motor.” He doesn’t have the perpetual high-energy pace that someone such as George Springer does. What matters, though, is how Moran acts when the ball is in play, and there’s a reason he was given a $3,516,500 signing bonus. 
Moran’s always going to be associated with his uncle, 19-year major league veteran B.J. Surhoff, at least until nephew’s own big league career gets underway. Moran, 6-4, bats lefthanded just as his uncle did.
The prize of the Cosart trade could prove to be Moran, although the Astros are very high on Jake Marisnick, who could be a starting outfielder this year. The Astros also sent out minor league outfielder Austin Wates in the six-player deal, while receiving a young minor league pitcher, Francis Martes.
Up until the trade, Moran was not struggling at High Class A in the Marlins system, but he wasn’t dominating, either. He hit .287 with a .327 on-base percentage through the first half, but picked it up with a .303 average and .361 OBP in the second half. In 89 games total before the deal, he hit .292 with a .342 OBP and five home runs.
Then came the trade, and the Astros challenged Moran right away with a trip to Class AA Corpus Christi. The numbers perked a bit, with a .304/.350/.411 line and two homers in 28 games to end the year. 







“I don’t know about that,” Moran said when asked if the deal kickstarted him. “Just kind of a new team, new league and all that. It was kind of cool, but I mean, I don’t know — it was kind of a whirlwind between the whole first spring training, first year and got traded and then going to a new team again. It was a lot of fun.”
With the Astros’ other third-base prospect, Rio Ruiz, traded this winter as part of the Evan Gattis deal, Moran stands as the ‘Stros third baseman of the future. He’s been invited to big league again camp this year, and has an outside chance to make the club later in 2015, but 2016 seems a more realistic possibility. 
Along with 2012 top overall pick Carlos Correa and 2013 top overall pick Mark Appel, Moran rounds out a trio of big-name prospects who could transform the look of the team in coming years. 
“Definitely going into the first (major league camp), I didn’t really know what to expect, just trying to get to know everything about pro ball and how things work,” Moran said. “I think going into the second one, like anything else, is a little easier.
“That’s everyone’s hope, is to get there (to the majors). I don’t really think about a timeline of getting there. Just try and work hard so that when I am there, I can stay there, that’s really just the goal.”
Moran split the winter between Jupiter, Fla., where he spent last spring training and the first half of the season with the Marlins, and Chapel Hill, N.C., where he went to college at UNC.
“I definitely have goals,” Moran said. “Going into spring training and a new team and everything, I’m just trying to work hard and see what happens pretty much.”
