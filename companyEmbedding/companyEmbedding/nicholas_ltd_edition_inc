He serves in a leadership position for the company as CEO and President, while primarily focusing his efforts day-to-day on investments as a Portfolio Manager and the Chief Investment Officer. Dave has developed his philosophy and skills over the past thirty years under the guidance of the long held investment philosophy and process developed by Albert O. Nicholas, the founder of Nicholas Company. This opportunity has allowed Dave to gain a deep experience and knowledge analyzing companies and the equity markets.

Dave’s approach is aligned with the Nicholas core investment philosophy and process, while adjusting it to meet the characteristics of various capitalization growth companies. Core elements to the philosophy include identifying companies with secular growth capabilities, consistent earnings growth, strong balance sheets and solid management teams. Dave also shares a preference for non-consensus strategies when market opportunities arise.

Dave is the lead portfolio manager of Nicholas Fund, Nicholas II and Nicholas Limited Edition, while serving as co-manager for Nicholas Equity Income Fund. As Chief Investment Officer he guides the firm’s investment process and the investment team on a day-to-day basis.

Dave earned a B.B.A. in Finance from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and completed his M.S. in Finance at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where he is a member of the University’s Business School Advisory Board. He has earned the right to use the CFA designation and is a member of the CFA Society Milwaukee.Morningstar Style BoxYahoo partners with Morningstar a leading market research and investment data group to help investors rate and compare funds on Yahoo Finance. The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment.

Why Nicholas Company
Nicholas Company is an independently owned investment firm that has operated under the same investment philosophy, process and management since its founding by Albert, “Ab”, O. Nicholas in 1967. Our philosophy is based on a fundamental, bottom-up approach to security selection with a long-term investment horizon.  Our process focuses on identifying securities offering secular growth characteristics, strong financial bases, reasonable valuations and downside risk. Our long-term approach deemphasizes the short-term impact of day-to-day market volatility and maintains a focus on the long-term potential of the securities in our portfolios. Providing a more consistent return with reduced volatility encourages investors to maintain market exposure and stay invested for the long run. The Nicholas investment style tends to appeal to investors willing to forego some upside in market cycles for a more consistent return with the potential for less downside risk. 
Invest with Nicholas Funds
Nicholas Funds offer six investment strategies that are open to investors on a direct basis, via a brokerage platform or through their financial adviser. We offer four equity strategies, a high yield corporate fund and a money market fund. A key objective for Nicholas Funds is to keep expense ratios low in an effort to return as much of the investment performance back to the shareholders. To accommodate the different methods investors choose to invest in mutual funds, Nicholas offers both Institutional Shares (“I Shares”) as well as “N Shares” for a select group of our Funds. The N Shares offers a 12b-1 and servicing fee for platforms, retirement plans and financial advisers.

Please refer to each prospectus for important information about each investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. 
Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Small- and medium-capitalization companies tend to have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by the Funds in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. 
Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market.
