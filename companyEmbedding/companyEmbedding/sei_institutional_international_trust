Thompson, Siegel & Walmsley LLC


                  Thompson, Siegel & Walmsley (TSW) uses a combination of fundamental and quantitative analysis as the basis for their investment processes. TSW's typical assignments involve a specific strategy, such as \"\"small cap value\"\" or \"\"core plus fixed income\"\" in which they use a variety of equity and/or fixed income processes to select securities that are designed to outperform a specific industry benchmark. In other instances, usually for high net-worth clients, the strategies may be combined in order to produce a \"\"balanced portfolio\"\" to meet a specific client asset allocation objective or industry benchmark. TSW's strategies include: Equity (Domestic and International), Strategic High Income, Fixed Income, Custom Balanced, and WPS (long/short equity).

You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value 
					of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or 
					guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. A money market fund’s sponsor has no legal 
					obligation to provide financial support to the money market fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial 
					support to the money market fund at any time.
