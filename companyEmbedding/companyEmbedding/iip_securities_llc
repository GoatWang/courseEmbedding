	Here's what people are saying about IIP. 

Client Testimonials



	Having known Brian for nearly 5 years it has always been a pleasure to work with him in creating dynamic, useful solutions for Financial Advisors, Insurance professionals and for me in my own practice at 1st Capital Insurance Group. Brian’s solutions-driven, customer-focused approach has always allowed me to work more effectively in building relationships in the Chicago marketplace and surrounding communities.


	As my relationship with IIP continues, I look forward to bringing more new business to IIP as a result of the way Brian’s positive influences, professionalism, and experience have helped me grow my agency.
- Richard Chew – 1st Capital Insurance Group - Chicago



	I was looking for a broker with a combination of high integrity, a wide range of products from quality carriers and service that was prompt efficient and friendly. I found all of these with Andrea and her team at Innovative Insurance Partners. In fact after making a trip to Roanoke, Indiana to check out the facilities and spend time with them, the things I had been looking for exceeded my expectations. Thanks Innovative Insurance Partners.
- Dwight Vondra



	I have worked with Greg Orendorff for years and he has always been there with a quick answer to all my questions and has always provided  excellent product choices that are in the best interest of my customers.  He does all this with a smile in his voice no matter how many questions I have.  Tammy Love is outstanding in her help and I have worked with Denny many times also,  they are all very quick with their turnaround time and willing to go the extra mile for me. (which is often) They always have a can do  attitude and an excellent span of knowledge in each of their respective fields.  
- Janet Taranto CSA, Owner, Taranto Insurance Services



	I trust my Life business with Greg, because I can depend on his experience, solid advice, and great service.  He knows the carriers and products in and out, and he reduces my workload and worry so I can spend more time on client relationships.    
- Josh Blanchard, Independent Agent, Eastern Tennessee



	Denny Geiger has been an excellent person to work with. I have had many cases recently in which Denny’s added expertise have helped our agents close business. Denny and IIP have both been tremendous assets to our firm!
- Joseph R., Marketing Coordinator, Independent Agency



	I have been working with Brian Wolf for over 15 years.   That is because he has always taken good care of me and my insured’s.     He knows his products and knows the industry trends.   He works with the best companies, and works to find me the best market that matches the client’s situation.
	You don’t work with a guy for 15 years unless the situation is right.
- Steve Miller, 2011 IIAI Agent of the Year, Knapp-Miller-Brown Insurance



	Brian Wolf is great to work with.  One of the best things about working with Brian is his level of service.   Always being reachable and prompt replies to phone calls are very important to me, and nobody I work with is better at that than him.  No less important is Brian's expertise in Life Insurance.  His years of experience and expertise help me in assessing health conditions and determining ratings, as well as which insurance companies will handle my clients specific needs the best.  Brian is a big help to my practice and I know I can depend on him.
- Timothy Demeritt, Financial Planner



	I have found working with Innovative Insurance Partners the past six months to have been fantastic.  I needed a custom, friendly and focused support staff willing to assist my organization for product and case management.  The life support from Denny Geiger and the case follow up for written business has been done professionally and quickly.  When I needed help in a different product line, such as DI, IIP was there to provide support.  Oh, by the way, they pay quickly.
- Patrick R., South Carolina



	Hey Denny-

We’ve been producing insurance business together for the past 10-15 years, and suffice it to say, you’re the man when it comes to life insurance planning!...whether we’re running GUL quotes, or more simple UL illustrations, or funding Buy-Sell cases, or even just basic Mom-Pop/family “term” life insurance protection, you're the source I turn to to run the quotes needed!... I’ve made the journey with you, because I rely on you for the quotes that best-fit the situation, as you understand from both the producer’s viewpoint as well as the proper textbook uses of our industry’s products...keep up the good work!
- Bob Adams, CLU, ChFC, Agent



	Since my introduction to Innovative Insurance Partners LLC, I have found Kim Nedberg to be friendly, knowledgeable, and most helpful with all my questions and concerns.  If I need information or a quote she responds to me in an expeditious manner.  She helped me with my licensing process, with Banner Life Ins. Co., and in acquiring my E&O insurance.  Kim has made my relationship with your agency very pleasant.  With her enthusiasm and work ethic I know Innovative Insurance Partners will continue to be successful.
- Ken Hollister, Agent



	Kim is a joy to work with!  She is very knowledgeable and consistently provides excellent service.
- Shanna Cleveland, Licensed Executive Assistant with Pryor McCormick
