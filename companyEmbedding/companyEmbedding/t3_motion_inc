T3 Motion Increases Tactical Gear Line with Revolutionary Products Designed for Public Safety and Military Applications







T3 Motion Tactical Products

Since 2006, T3 Motion has been a leader in technology for the global public safety markets and these new products confirm our vision of being the number one source for tactical technology.


Brea, CA (PRWEB)
June 10, 2016
 T3 Motion, Inc. (OTC: TTTM), the global leader in the design and delivery of electric vehicles and tactical technology to the law enforcement, military, and security markets, announced additions to their new line of T3 Motion Tactical Gear, including the T3 TG-3 I.E.D. Explosion Containment Device, TG-5 Tactical Breaching Energy Transfer Medium, and T3 ALPR portable Automated License Plate Recognition system.  
T3 Motion’s Tactical Technology products are truly revolutionary game-changers.  The T3 TG-3 is a field explosive containment device that reduces dangerous I.E.D. lateral energy and shrapnel scatter by over 95% (15-foot radius vs. 300 feet).  The T3 TG-5 is a tactical entry explosive bladder that minimizes blowback distance by over 84% (8 feet vs. 50 feet when using typical “water” bladders) and produces zero fragments.  The T3 ALPR is the only fully-portable, self-powered automated License Plate Recognition system available.  The T3 ALPR can be easily deployed in unmarked cars, golf carts, electric stand-up vehicles, or used on a tripod at checkpoints.
“We are excited to continue to add new remarkable products to T3 Motion’s tactical gear line, including the T3 TG-3 I.E.D. Container, the TG-5 Tactical Breaching material, and the T3 ALPR,” said Noel Cherowbrier, C.E.O. of T3 Motion, Inc. “Our customer base of Law Enforcement, Military, and Security agencies are constantly on the lookout for the best technology for their applications and T3 Motion continues to respond to their needs.  Since 2006, T3 Motion has been a leader in technology for the global public safety markets and these new products confirm our vision of being the number one source for tactical technology.”

"The future for T3 Motion is as bright as ever with our new investment team, continued focus on clean energy patrol vehicles, and our tactical product line expansion. T3 Motion has long been the leader in the global public safety market and we are very excited to continue to expand our tactical technology expertise worldwide."About T3 Motion, Inc.: T3 Motion, Inc.
