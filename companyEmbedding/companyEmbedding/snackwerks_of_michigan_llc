While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating. To learn more about forming an S Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a S Corporation  NonprofitForm a NonprofitThe Nonprofit corporation is a special type of business structure that exists to provide certain benefits to organizations that have as their main goal service to the public. Much like other formal business types, those who run Nonprofits are provided limited liability protection.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.
