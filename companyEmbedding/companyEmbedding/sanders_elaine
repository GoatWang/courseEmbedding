As a “real New Yorker in the audience,” Benes asks Sanders to be more specific about his “vague” plans to break up big banks. “Once I’m elected president, I’ll have a nice schvitz in the White House gym, then I’ll go to the big banks, I’ll sit them down and yada, yada, yada, they’ll be broken up,” David’s Sanders says.“What? You can’t yada, yada at a debate,” Elaine responds. She then turns to ask the former Secretary of State: “Doesn’t it suck to be the only girl in a group of guys?”Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
