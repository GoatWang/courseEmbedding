 Region Covers Ohio, Indiana and Michigan

 CLEVELAND, Sept. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Key Community Bank
has appointed Charles W. (Chuck) Sulerzyski to the newly created
position of president, Great Lakes Region. Sulerzyski will be based in
Cleveland and report to Key Community Bank President George E. Emmons,
Jr.

 In his new role, Sulerzyski will be responsible for Retail Banking,
Business Banking and middle-market Commercial Banking throughout Ohio,
Indiana and Michigan. Additionally, he will partner with the senior
sales managers of McDonald Financial Group (MFG), the unit of
Cleveland-based KeyCorp that provides banking, investing and trust
services to affluent individuals, to ensure a seamless delivery of
products and services to clients. He also will oversee the Great Lakes
Region's revenue, expense management, profit and credit quality, as
well as growing the client base in all franchise businesses. Nine
district presidents within the Great Lakes Region will report to
Sulerzyski.

 Late last year, Key placed most of its district-based businesses
under geographic management within its Community Bank. The Community
Bank's organizational structure enables Key to better serve its
clients and reinforce its relationship strategy.

 "Chuck's experience and knowledge in leading retail and
consumer financial services organizations will allow us to deliver the
right ideas and solutions that make a difference for our clients,"
says Emmons.

 Sulerzyski's appointment is the second of four regional
president positions to be filled. Last week, Key Community Bank
announced the promotion of Thomas X. Geisel to Northeast region
president. The two remaining open positions are in the Rocky Mountain
and Pacific Northwest Regions.

 Sulerzyski brings to Key more than 30 years of experience in
consumer financial services. He has held numerous senior management
roles during his career, including executive vice president, Retail
Banking Group, at Provident Bank, and CEO of BancOne's Investment
Management and Trust Group. He most recently served as managing
director, Marsh Affinity and Private Client Practices, at Marsh &
McLennan in New York City.

 Returning to the Midwest, Sulerzyski brings a civic-minded spirit
for working with local school systems and a talent for fundraising
through involvement in the United Way, American Cancer Association and
American Diabetes Association (ADA). Last year, he raised the largest
amount of funds for ADA in Rhode Island.

 Sulerzyski graduated from New York University with a degree in
Economics and earned an MBA in marketing from Fordham University's
Graduate School of Business.

 Cleveland-based KeyCorp is one of the nation's largest
bank-based financial services companies, with assets of approximately
$91 billion. Key companies provide investment management, retail and
commercial banking, retirement, consumer finance, and investment banking
products and services to individuals and companies throughout the United
States and, for certain businesses, internationally. As part of KeyCorp,
McDonald Financial Group offers integrated financial services -
including banking, estate planning, financial planning, retirement
planning, brokerage, trust, individual asset management, insurance
advice and services, and charitable giving counsel - to affluent
individuals in offices in 15 states. Securities are offered through
McDonald Investments Inc., member NYSE/NASD/SIPC.
