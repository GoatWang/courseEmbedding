How would you describe your past investing experiences?

If you answered "Frustrating," "disappointing" or "confusing," then you're certainly not alone. Perhaps the most common mistake investors make is to let emotions drive their investment decisions. So, how do you keep emotions in check and avoid making common investing mistakes? First, it makes sense to get assistance from a financial professional - someone who can help you develop strategies to meet your specific needs. In addition, research shows that strategies built upon the principles of asset allocation and diversification can help you reduce risk and earn more consistent performance over time.
As financial products become more complex, we offer a simple way to overcome the emotion of investing and help you pursue your investment objectives - the John Hancock Lifestyle Portfolios.

A unique investment solution that can offer powerful, long-term benefits

With Lifestyle portfolios you gain access to a sophisticated asset allocation and diversification process managed by experienced professionals. These portfolios invest in a number of other mutual funds and are designed to meet your particular investment objectives - by offering varying levels of risk and return potential.

Five multi-asset, multi-style and multi-managed portfolios that match you with an appropriate risk-based Lifestyle portfolio.
More than 25 world-class investment managers who are experts in their specific areas.
Monitored and rebalanced on an ongoing basis to maintain their target allocations

Discover the John Hancock Lifestyle Portfolios

Work with your financial professional today to evaluate your financial situation and goals. Your advisor can help you select the appropriate John Hancock Lifestyle Portfolio for your personal needs and risk tolerance.
Asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protection against loss. Please note that asset allocation may not be appropriate for all investors, particularly those interested in directing the underlying funds on their own. A Lifestyle Portfolio is subject to the same risks as the underlying funds in which it invests, which include the following risks. Stocks and bonds can decline due to adverse issuer, market, regulatory or economic developments. Investing in foreign securities is subject to certain risks not associated with domestic investing such as currency fluctuations and changes in political and economic conditions. The securities of small capitalization companies are subject to higher volatility than larger, more established companies. High yield bonds are subject to additional risks, such as the increased risk of default. Before making an investment in a Lifestyle Portfolio, you should consider all the risks associated with it.Click here  to view the Lifestyle Portfolios Prospectus.

You just want to ride. We just want to help.At SmartPak, we've been using our smarts to power healthy horses and happy riders since 1999.  We started with the SmartPaks supplement feeding system, which has been described as "the best thing to happen to the barn since the wheelbarrow."  Over the years, we expanded our service from the feed room to the tack room, growing from a one-stop shop for all horse supplements to the largest online tack store in the U.S. and a #1 Google-rated source for equestrian supplies.  With free shipping every day, free return shipping on all sized items, and our 100% Happiness Guarantee, it's easy to see why more and more riders make SmartPak their first stop for everything from horse products to rider apparel.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
