Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection1. Jewell Smokeless Coal Corp15498 Riverside DrOakwood, VA 24631(276) 935-8810Coal Miners & ShippersCoal & CokeAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection2. Jewell Smokeless Coal Corp1029 Miners RdOakwood, VA 24631(276) 935-8810Coal & CokeCoal Miners & ShippersAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection3. Jewell Smokeless Coal Corporation5780 State Line Ridge RdGrundy, VA 24614(276) 259-7011Coal & CokeAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection4. Jewell Smokeless Coal Corp - CLOSED1674 Jewell Valley RdJewell Ridge, VA 24622(276) 881-8385Coal Miners & ShippersAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection5. Rapoca Energy Co1242 Homecreek RdBig Rock, VA 24603(276) 530-7117Coal & CokeAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection6. A B & J Coal Co4800 Conaway RdBig Rock, VA 24603(276) 530-7786Coal Miners & ShippersAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection7. Paramount Coal Co4592 Monte LnBee, VA 24217(276) 859-2046Coal & CokeCoal Miners & ShippersAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection8. Virginia Energy CoElk CrkHurley, VA 24620(276) 566-8514Coal Miners & ShippersCoal & CokeAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection9. Virginia Crews Coal Co46 46thIaeger, WV 24844(304) 938-5700Coal & CokeAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection10. Hampden Coal CoW GilbertGilbert, WV 25621(304) 664-2119Coal & CokeCoal Miners & ShippersAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection11. Mc Coy Elkorn Coal Co2069 State Highway 194 EPikeville, KY 41501(606) 631-1615Coal & CokeWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection12. James River Coal Company2069 State Highway 194 EPikeville, KY 41501(606) 631-4437Coal & CokeCoal Miners & ShippersWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection13. Sidney Coal CoBig Creek RdStone, KY 41567(606) 353-7201Coal & CokeAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection14. Shane Coal CompanyAsco HolwDavy, WV 24828(304) 656-9966Coal & CokeAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection15. McCoy Elkorn Coal Co2004 State Highway 194 EPikeville, KY 41501(606) 631-7207Coal & CokeAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection16. Premier Elkhorn Coal Co6920 Ky Highway 610 WJenkins, KY 41537(606) 639-0933Coal Miners & ShippersMining CompaniesWebsiteFrom Business: Premier Elkhorn Coal Company provides coal for steel mills and other metallurgical products.

History
50 years of cokemaking experience
SunCoke Energy has a rich history in coal mining and cokemaking. Our past successes give us the confidence and determination to prosper and grow our company.

Jewell Coke Plant in Vansant, Virginia
Starting in coal mining at our metallurgical coal mining operations, SunCoke Energy’s operations have grown over the years to include five coke plants in the Americas.
SunCoke Energy’s cokemaking process started when B. Ray Thompson built three test ovens in Vansant, Virginia in the early 1960’s. A four month test found that coke could be made from Virginia coal. Production was scaled up during the next ten years. In 1969, 450,000 tons of coke were produced per year at what is now our Jewell cokemaking facility.
Production continued to expand into the 1970’s when 16 large Jewell-Thompson ovens were built, increasing capacity by 80,000 tons per year. In the early 1980’s, SunCoke Energy improved its technology with enhanced combustion control and oven construction techniques, thereby enhancing coke quality. Then in the late 1980’s, we developed new technologies and processes to monitor and control oven temperatures increasing our coking cycles to 48 hours.
With a mature and robust coke oven technology, SunCoke Energy continued to improve its coke quality and coal-to-coke yield through the 1990's. During that time we also implemented our heat recovery/power generation technology.
As a result of the design improvements and extensive operational know-how developed since we began coke production in 1962, we believe that we possess the most advanced and environmentally sound cokemaking technology in the industry.  Our oven design and operational practices also allow us to produce more electricity from our heat recovery process than any competing heat recovery technology.
Today, SunCoke Energy currently operates metallurgical coke plants in Vansant, Virginia; East Chicago, Indiana; Haverhill, Ohio; Granite City, Illinois; Middletown, Ohio; and Vitória, Brazil . These facilities produce over 5 million tons of coke each year.
