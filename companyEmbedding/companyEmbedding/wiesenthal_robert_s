Early life[edit]
Wiesenthal was raised in Manhattan, New York City, and shared a love of gadgets and entertainment with his father, Richard, who sold “I Love Lucy” reruns for Telepictures in Latin America. He studied robotics in his spare time, and co-wrote a book for Ziff-Davis on personal computers when he was in high school.[5] Wiesenthal graduated from the University of Rochester, receiving a B.A. degree cum laude in Political Science in 1988.
Business career[edit]
Prior to Sony[edit]
Early in his career, Bruce Wasserstein hired Wiesenthal as a junior investment banker at First Boston after he had fixed Wasserstein’s printer, where at the time he was a summer intern providing technical support. “I fixed the right guy’s printer,” he said.[6][7]
At First Boston, he was a member of its Mergers & Acquisitions group, beginning in 1986, later joining their Media group in 1993. He was named Managing Director of Credit Suisse First Boston (or CSFB) in 1999 and headed its entertainment and digital media efforts under Frank Quattrone.
As one of CSFB’s lead media bankers, notable transactions on which he was an advisor included Seagram’s $5.7 billion acquisition of MCA Inc., Liberty Media’s merger with TCI, News Corp’s $3.2 billion purchase of New World Communications and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.’s acquisition of Telemundo, the nation’s second largest Spanish televisioal media sector,.
Sony[edit]
On June 27, 2000, Sir Howard Stringer, Sony Corp.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, hired Wiesenthal as Chief Strategic Officer for Sony Broadband Entertainment , a move described in Fortune as one of Stringer’s “smartest moves”.[8] Sony Broadband Entertainment (now known as Sony Entertainment) was established in March 2000 to house the corporation’s U.S. entertainment assets, its film and television studio and music group.
Wiesenthal moved quickly to buy and sell stakes in a variety of businesses; in 2001, he sold 50 percent of Sony’s Game Show Network to Liberty Digital, and Sony’s stake in Telemundo to NBCUniversal, a deal worth over $2 billion. He had Sony join with Philips N.V. to buy InterTrust Technologies, the owner of patents for most digital-rights-management technologies. He negotiated "strategic transactions" between Sony and Yahoo Inc. and then-AOL Time Warner Inc. At Sony Pictures Entertainment, he oversaw a corporate restructuring called "the 21st Century Studio Project," that resulted in savings of over $150 million at Sony’s studio operations. Among the biggest changes was at Sony Pictures’ U.S. network television production, where he greatly reduced the number of television series it produced. Wiesenthal told The New York Times, "We asked ourselves the tough questions in each of Sony Pictures’ businesses to ensure the underlying economics made sense in the current environment."[9]
On January 16, 2002, Wiesenthal was promoted to Sony's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, a move that the Wall Street Journal described as a strategy that Sony used to improve its stature in the business world. In April 2003, he was named to a seven-member committee of executives to oversee the operations of Sony Pictures Entertainment. In June, 2005, after Stringer was promoted to Chief Executive of Sony Corporation, he gave Wiesenthal the additional responsibility of head of corporate development and mergers and acquisitions for Sony Corporation. During his tenure, Wiesenthal oversaw all financial aspects of Sony Corporation of America across its operating companies, including budget setting, long range planning, capital, and financing decisions. He was also responsible for Sony's U.S. Investor Relations activities. He was a member of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s Operating Committee and was on the Boards of Directors of Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.
In late 2005, after being given responsibility for Sony's Music publishing joint venture, Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal sent a fax to Michael Jackson knowing that the pop singer (who died June 25, 2009) was about to default on a loan secured by his stake in the venture and offered to discuss ways to help. Sony did not want Jackson’s portion of Sony/ATV to wind up in bankruptcy court. Wiesenthal traveled to the Middle East and met Jackson in Dubai to inform him that Sony had backers from Citi who were willing to refinance his ATV debt on much better terms. In exchange, Sony obtained greater operational control over the business, a right of refusal on his stake, and an option to buy half of Jackson’s half for approximately $250 million.[10] These moves helped consolidate Sony's control of the unit.[11]
After obtaining greater authority over the operations of Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal led Sony/ATV’s acquisitions of the Leiber Stoller and Viacom’s Famous Music catalogs in 2007. In 2007, in an effort to bolster the management strength of Sony’s publishing operations, Wiesenthal recruited Martin Bandier, chairman and co-chief executive of EMI Group’s EMI Music Publishing unit, to be chief executive of the unit.[12] Wiesenthal believes music publishing companies are well equipped to compete and be successful in the music industry of the future. He said, "Lenders—whether private lenders or banks—feel much more comfortable with the credit quality of publishing vs. recorded music. In terms of the banks I speak with, there's clearly an interest on the publishing side."[13]
In 2008, Wiesenthal and his corporate development team enabled Sony to be the first company to transmit a feature film directly to internet-connected televisions that were not covered by conventional cable and satellite distributors. They offered the film Hancock, featuring Will Smith, for a fee to customers with Sony's internet-connected televisions, prior to the film's availability on DVD. At the time, laptops and PC's were largely the only method in which customers could view digital streams of feature content.[14]
Also in 2008, he led the transaction to buy Bertelsmann out of its half of Sony BMG, ending a joint venture formed in 2004. Stringer said the "new Sony Music would give the group 'far more flexibility' to use music in its film and television units, and in electronics, including the Play-Station".[15] Nancy Peretsman of Allen & Co. described Wiesenthal as "relatively egoless" and "always focused on the outcome". In his role at Sony Entertainment, he also oversaw Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which was established in 1995 as a joint venture between Sony and trusts formed by Michael Jackson.
After separating music publishing from Sony's music assets after the merger of Sony Music and BMG’s Music Group, Howard Stringer charged Wiesenthal with the responsibility to grow Sony/ATV Music publishing via acquisition, a strategy that had previously fallen to the wayside when the business was previously part of Sony's Music unit.[16] At the time, Sony/ATV, was the smallest of the major music publishing companies.
In 2010, Wiesenthal and David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications, conceived of and structured a partnership bringing together the largest players in 3D to create the world’s first 24-hour 3D network. The network, 3NET, launched on DirecTV in 2011 as a partnership between Sony, Discovery Communications and IMAX. Sony owns 33% of the venture and Wiesenthal sits on its board of directors.[17] Wiesenthal also championed the Sony Dash, the world's first Internet connected alarm clock for the bedside or desktop.[18]
In 2011, Wiesenthal orchestrated a complex deal acquiring EMI Publishing for $2.2 billion to an investor consortium led by Sony. The investor group included media mogul David Geffen, the estate of Michael Jackson, Blackstone’s GSO’s Capital Partners, Mubadala Development Company (the investment arm of Abu Dhabi), and Jynwel Capital of Hong Kong. "We found long-term investors, who are not just looking at the short-term returns typical of private equity," Wiesenthal said.[19] The New York Times, in a Deals of the Year wrap-up, called it the "sleeper deal of 2011," one that "might have been the most interesting."[20] Billboard described Wiesenthal as a "winner" in the deal: he helped assemble a consortium of investors to buy EMI Music Publishing. As a result of the transaction, Sony now controls the largest collection of publishing copyrights in the world.”[21] Bob Pittman, CEO of Clear Channel Communications said, "He took it from being insignificant to being the biggest."[22]
As Sony entered the tablet market in 2011, Wiesenthal publicly discussed the important role of the marriage of tablets and television can play in the emerging connected television business. He told a Goldman Sachs conference in New York that, although five years previously, "it was all about the boxes; TiVo, Slingbox, Roku, I think the consumers really have box exhaustion." In their place, TVs can evolve so they only have one wire: the power cord. Consumers, in turn, he said, will use tablets to access video content from the Cloud and control the TV screen.[23]
Warner Music Group[edit]
In January 2, 2013, Wiesenthal was hired as Chief Operating Office, Warner Music Group in an effort to bolster the company's M&A, corporate development, and digital initiatives.[3]
In early 2013, Wiesenthal played a key role in the Company's acquisition of Parlophone, one of the world's leading recorded music companies and home to Coldplay, David Guetta, and Pink Floyd.[24]
In September 2013, Wiesenthal led the effort to architect and launch a multi-platform alliance between Warner Music Group and Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio station operator in the United States. The New York Times said the deal, "re-writes the rules on royalties". [25]
Prior to joining Warner Music Group in 2013, Wiesenthal founded Blade, the first crowdsourced short distance aviation company.[26] In June 2014, Wiesenthal said he would leave Time Warner and work full-time in Blade as the latter's leader.[4]
In 2015, Wiesenthal negotiated an alliance on behalf of Warner Music Group with Snapchat to become the very first music company to have a channel on the Discover platform. With the Discover feature, companies could refresh “videos daily [and] create major promotional opportunities that [would] be monetized through sponsorship and advertising,” Wiesenthal stated in an interview with Billboard. Under the Warner Music Group section, Snapchat users could view sneak-peaks of music videos, daily headlines, advertisements, and promotions.[27]
Achievements[edit]
Crain’s New York Business named him on its “40 Under 40” list in 2003.[5]
In 2010, Wiesenthal was an inductee of the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders, along with Sergey Brin of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Peter Thiel of PayPal, and others.[28]
In 2014, he was named to the Billboard Power 100, an annual survey of the most powerful people in the music business as determined by Billboard Magazine.[29]
In October, 2015, the company he co-founded, BLADE, was named one the "100 Hottest Startups in New York City" as determined by Business Insider. [30]
He serves on the Board of Directors of Entercom Communications Corp., the fourth largest radio broadcaster in the U.S., TripAdvisor, Inc. (The 2nd largest East Coast-based Internet company by market capitalization.), global pay-TV network operator Starz as well as Jawbone, a leading connected consumer device company specializing in personal wellness technology and audio products.[31]
He is a mentor of Techstars NYC (www.techstars.com) a mentorship-driven start-up accelerator and seed fund that helps emerging digital companies launch and obtain strategic funding. [32]
Personal life[edit]
Wiesenthal lives in New York City. He had raced Formula Ford cars in the U.S. which led to passion of car collecting and subsequently to creating with a partner the Bridgehampton Motoring Club, the leading Active Storage Collector car facility in the U.S.[33]
During Roger Waters' 2010 U.S. tour "The Wall", Wiesenthal played ukulele with Waters and his band during a set for two dates at Madison Square Garden.[34]
Wiesenthal was previously married to Goldman Sachs managing director Linnea Conrad.[35] They have one son (born 1997).[36]

Early life[edit]
Wiesenthal was raised in Manhattan, New York City, and shared a love of gadgets and entertainment with his father, Richard, who sold “I Love Lucy” reruns for Telepictures in Latin America. He studied robotics in his spare time, and co-wrote a book for Ziff-Davis on personal computers when he was in high school.[5] Wiesenthal graduated from the University of Rochester, receiving a B.A. degree cum laude in Political Science in 1988.
Business career[edit]
Prior to Sony[edit]
Early in his career, Bruce Wasserstein hired Wiesenthal as a junior investment banker at First Boston after he had fixed Wasserstein’s printer, where at the time he was a summer intern providing technical support. “I fixed the right guy’s printer,” he said.[6][7]
At First Boston, he was a member of its Mergers & Acquisitions group, beginning in 1986, later joining their Media group in 1993. He was named Managing Director of Credit Suisse First Boston (or CSFB) in 1999 and headed its entertainment and digital media efforts under Frank Quattrone.
As one of CSFB’s lead media bankers, notable transactions on which he was an advisor included Seagram’s $5.7 billion acquisition of MCA Inc., Liberty Media’s merger with TCI, News Corp’s $3.2 billion purchase of New World Communications and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.’s acquisition of Telemundo, the nation’s second largest Spanish televisioal media sector,.
Sony[edit]
On June 27, 2000, Sir Howard Stringer, Sony Corp.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, hired Wiesenthal as Chief Strategic Officer for Sony Broadband Entertainment , a move described in Fortune as one of Stringer’s “smartest moves”.[8] Sony Broadband Entertainment (now known as Sony Entertainment) was established in March 2000 to house the corporation’s U.S. entertainment assets, its film and television studio and music group.
Wiesenthal moved quickly to buy and sell stakes in a variety of businesses; in 2001, he sold 50 percent of Sony’s Game Show Network to Liberty Digital, and Sony’s stake in Telemundo to NBCUniversal, a deal worth over $2 billion. He had Sony join with Philips N.V. to buy InterTrust Technologies, the owner of patents for most digital-rights-management technologies. He negotiated "strategic transactions" between Sony and Yahoo Inc. and then-AOL Time Warner Inc. At Sony Pictures Entertainment, he oversaw a corporate restructuring called "the 21st Century Studio Project," that resulted in savings of over $150 million at Sony’s studio operations. Among the biggest changes was at Sony Pictures’ U.S. network television production, where he greatly reduced the number of television series it produced. Wiesenthal told The New York Times, "We asked ourselves the tough questions in each of Sony Pictures’ businesses to ensure the underlying economics made sense in the current environment."[9]
On January 16, 2002, Wiesenthal was promoted to Sony's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, a move that the Wall Street Journal described as a strategy that Sony used to improve its stature in the business world. In April 2003, he was named to a seven-member committee of executives to oversee the operations of Sony Pictures Entertainment. In June, 2005, after Stringer was promoted to Chief Executive of Sony Corporation, he gave Wiesenthal the additional responsibility of head of corporate development and mergers and acquisitions for Sony Corporation. During his tenure, Wiesenthal oversaw all financial aspects of Sony Corporation of America across its operating companies, including budget setting, long range planning, capital, and financing decisions. He was also responsible for Sony's U.S. Investor Relations activities. He was a member of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s Operating Committee and was on the Boards of Directors of Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.
In late 2005, after being given responsibility for Sony's Music publishing joint venture, Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal sent a fax to Michael Jackson knowing that the pop singer (who died June 25, 2009) was about to default on a loan secured by his stake in the venture and offered to discuss ways to help. Sony did not want Jackson’s portion of Sony/ATV to wind up in bankruptcy court. Wiesenthal traveled to the Middle East and met Jackson in Dubai to inform him that Sony had backers from Citi who were willing to refinance his ATV debt on much better terms. In exchange, Sony obtained greater operational control over the business, a right of refusal on his stake, and an option to buy half of Jackson’s half for approximately $250 million.[10] These moves helped consolidate Sony's control of the unit.[11]
After obtaining greater authority over the operations of Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal led Sony/ATV’s acquisitions of the Leiber Stoller and Viacom’s Famous Music catalogs in 2007. In 2007, in an effort to bolster the management strength of Sony’s publishing operations, Wiesenthal recruited Martin Bandier, chairman and co-chief executive of EMI Group’s EMI Music Publishing unit, to be chief executive of the unit.[12] Wiesenthal believes music publishing companies are well equipped to compete and be successful in the music industry of the future. He said, "Lenders—whether private lenders or banks—feel much more comfortable with the credit quality of publishing vs. recorded music. In terms of the banks I speak with, there's clearly an interest on the publishing side."[13]
In 2008, Wiesenthal and his corporate development team enabled Sony to be the first company to transmit a feature film directly to internet-connected televisions that were not covered by conventional cable and satellite distributors. They offered the film Hancock, featuring Will Smith, for a fee to customers with Sony's internet-connected televisions, prior to the film's availability on DVD. At the time, laptops and PC's were largely the only method in which customers could view digital streams of feature content.[14]
Also in 2008, he led the transaction to buy Bertelsmann out of its half of Sony BMG, ending a joint venture formed in 2004. Stringer said the "new Sony Music would give the group 'far more flexibility' to use music in its film and television units, and in electronics, including the Play-Station".[15] Nancy Peretsman of Allen & Co. described Wiesenthal as "relatively egoless" and "always focused on the outcome". In his role at Sony Entertainment, he also oversaw Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which was established in 1995 as a joint venture between Sony and trusts formed by Michael Jackson.
After separating music publishing from Sony's music assets after the merger of Sony Music and BMG’s Music Group, Howard Stringer charged Wiesenthal with the responsibility to grow Sony/ATV Music publishing via acquisition, a strategy that had previously fallen to the wayside when the business was previously part of Sony's Music unit.[16] At the time, Sony/ATV, was the smallest of the major music publishing companies.
In 2010, Wiesenthal and David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications, conceived of and structured a partnership bringing together the largest players in 3D to create the world’s first 24-hour 3D network. The network, 3NET, launched on DirecTV in 2011 as a partnership between Sony, Discovery Communications and IMAX. Sony owns 33% of the venture and Wiesenthal sits on its board of directors.[17] Wiesenthal also championed the Sony Dash, the world's first Internet connected alarm clock for the bedside or desktop.[18]
In 2011, Wiesenthal orchestrated a complex deal acquiring EMI Publishing for $2.2 billion to an investor consortium led by Sony. The investor group included media mogul David Geffen, the estate of Michael Jackson, Blackstone’s GSO’s Capital Partners, Mubadala Development Company (the investment arm of Abu Dhabi), and Jynwel Capital of Hong Kong. "We found long-term investors, who are not just looking at the short-term returns typical of private equity," Wiesenthal said.[19] The New York Times, in a Deals of the Year wrap-up, called it the "sleeper deal of 2011," one that "might have been the most interesting."[20] Billboard described Wiesenthal as a "winner" in the deal: he helped assemble a consortium of investors to buy EMI Music Publishing. As a result of the transaction, Sony now controls the largest collection of publishing copyrights in the world.”[21] Bob Pittman, CEO of Clear Channel Communications said, "He took it from being insignificant to being the biggest."[22]
As Sony entered the tablet market in 2011, Wiesenthal publicly discussed the important role of the marriage of tablets and television can play in the emerging connected television business. He told a Goldman Sachs conference in New York that, although five years previously, "it was all about the boxes; TiVo, Slingbox, Roku, I think the consumers really have box exhaustion." In their place, TVs can evolve so they only have one wire: the power cord. Consumers, in turn, he said, will use tablets to access video content from the Cloud and control the TV screen.[23]
Warner Music Group[edit]
In January 2, 2013, Wiesenthal was hired as Chief Operating Office, Warner Music Group in an effort to bolster the company's M&A, corporate development, and digital initiatives.[3]
In early 2013, Wiesenthal played a key role in the Company's acquisition of Parlophone, one of the world's leading recorded music companies and home to Coldplay, David Guetta, and Pink Floyd.[24]
In September 2013, Wiesenthal led the effort to architect and launch a multi-platform alliance between Warner Music Group and Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio station operator in the United States. The New York Times said the deal, "re-writes the rules on royalties". [25]
Prior to joining Warner Music Group in 2013, Wiesenthal founded Blade, the first crowdsourced short distance aviation company.[26] In June 2014, Wiesenthal said he would leave Time Warner and work full-time in Blade as the latter's leader.[4]
In 2015, Wiesenthal negotiated an alliance on behalf of Warner Music Group with Snapchat to become the very first music company to have a channel on the Discover platform. With the Discover feature, companies could refresh “videos daily [and] create major promotional opportunities that [would] be monetized through sponsorship and advertising,” Wiesenthal stated in an interview with Billboard. Under the Warner Music Group section, Snapchat users could view sneak-peaks of music videos, daily headlines, advertisements, and promotions.[27]
Achievements[edit]
Crain’s New York Business named him on its “40 Under 40” list in 2003.[5]
In 2010, Wiesenthal was an inductee of the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders, along with Sergey Brin of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Peter Thiel of PayPal, and others.[28]
In 2014, he was named to the Billboard Power 100, an annual survey of the most powerful people in the music business as determined by Billboard Magazine.[29]
In October, 2015, the company he co-founded, BLADE, was named one the "100 Hottest Startups in New York City" as determined by Business Insider. [30]
He serves on the Board of Directors of Entercom Communications Corp., the fourth largest radio broadcaster in the U.S., TripAdvisor, Inc. (The 2nd largest East Coast-based Internet company by market capitalization.), global pay-TV network operator Starz as well as Jawbone, a leading connected consumer device company specializing in personal wellness technology and audio products.[31]
He is a mentor of Techstars NYC (www.techstars.com) a mentorship-driven start-up accelerator and seed fund that helps emerging digital companies launch and obtain strategic funding. [32]
Personal life[edit]
Wiesenthal lives in New York City. He had raced Formula Ford cars in the U.S. which led to passion of car collecting and subsequently to creating with a partner the Bridgehampton Motoring Club, the leading Active Storage Collector car facility in the U.S.[33]
During Roger Waters' 2010 U.S. tour "The Wall", Wiesenthal played ukulele with Waters and his band during a set for two dates at Madison Square Garden.[34]
Wiesenthal was previously married to Goldman Sachs managing director Linnea Conrad.[35] They have one son (born 1997).[36]

Sony[edit]
On June 27, 2000, Sir Howard Stringer, Sony Corp.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, hired Wiesenthal as Chief Strategic Officer for Sony Broadband Entertainment , a move described in Fortune as one of Stringer’s “smartest moves”.[8] Sony Broadband Entertainment (now known as Sony Entertainment) was established in March 2000 to house the corporation’s U.S. entertainment assets, its film and television studio and music group.
Wiesenthal moved quickly to buy and sell stakes in a variety of businesses; in 2001, he sold 50 percent of Sony’s Game Show Network to Liberty Digital, and Sony’s stake in Telemundo to NBCUniversal, a deal worth over $2 billion. He had Sony join with Philips N.V. to buy InterTrust Technologies, the owner of patents for most digital-rights-management technologies.

After separating music publishing from Sony's music assets after the merger of Sony Music and BMG’s Music Group, Howard Stringer charged Wiesenthal with the responsibility to grow Sony/ATV Music publishing via acquisition, a strategy that had previously fallen to the wayside when the business was previously part of Sony's Music unit.[16] At the time, Sony/ATV, was the smallest of the major music publishing companies.
In 2010, Wiesenthal and David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications, conceived of and structured a partnership bringing together the largest players in 3D to create the world’s first 24-hour 3D network. The network, 3NET, launched on DirecTV in 2011 as a partnership between Sony, Discovery Communications and IMAX. Sony owns 33% of the venture and Wiesenthal sits on its board of directors.[17] Wiesenthal also championed the Sony Dash, the world's first Internet connected alarm clock for the bedside or desktop.[18]
In 2011, Wiesenthal orchestrated a complex deal acquiring EMI Publishing for $2.2 billion to an investor consortium led by Sony. The investor group included media mogul David Geffen, the estate of Michael Jackson, Blackstone’s GSO’s Capital Partners, Mubadala Development Company (the investment arm of Abu Dhabi), and Jynwel Capital of Hong Kong. "We found long-term investors, who are not just looking at the short-term returns typical of private equity," Wiesenthal said.[19] The New York Times, in a Deals of the Year wrap-up, called it the "sleeper deal of 2011," one that "might have been the most interesting."[20] Billboard described Wiesenthal as a "winner" in the deal: he helped assemble a consortium of investors to buy EMI Music Publishing. As a result of the transaction, Sony now controls the largest collection of publishing copyrights in the world.”[21] Bob Pittman, CEO of Clear Channel Communications said, "He took it from being insignificant to being the biggest."[22]
As Sony entered the tablet market in 2011, Wiesenthal publicly discussed the important role of the marriage of tablets and television can play in the emerging connected television business. He told a Goldman Sachs conference in New York that, although five years previously, "it was all about the boxes; TiVo, Slingbox, Roku, I think the consumers really have box exhaustion." In their place, TVs can evolve so they only have one wire: the power cord. Consumers, in turn, he said, will use tablets to access video content from the Cloud and control the TV screen.[23]
Warner Music Group[edit]
In January 2, 2013, Wiesenthal was hired as Chief Operating Office, Warner Music Group in an effort to bolster the company's M&A, corporate development, and digital initiatives.[3]
In early 2013, Wiesenthal played a key role in the Company's acquisition of Parlophone, one of the world's leading recorded music companies and home to Coldplay, David Guetta, and Pink Floyd.[24]
In September 2013, Wiesenthal led the effort to architect and launch a multi-platform alliance between Warner Music Group and Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio station operator in the United States. The New York Times said the deal, "re-writes the rules on royalties". [25]
Prior to joining Warner Music Group in 2013, Wiesenthal founded Blade, the first crowdsourced short distance aviation company.[26] In June 2014, Wiesenthal said he would leave Time Warner and work full-time in Blade as the latter's leader.[4]
In 2015, Wiesenthal negotiated an alliance on behalf of Warner Music Group with Snapchat to become the very first music company to have a channel on the Discover platform. With the Discover feature, companies could refresh “videos daily [and] create major promotional opportunities that [would] be monetized through sponsorship and advertising,” Wiesenthal stated in an interview with Billboard. Under the Warner Music Group section, Snapchat users could view sneak-peaks of music videos, daily headlines, advertisements, and promotions.[27]
Achievements[edit]
Crain’s New York Business named him on its “40 Under 40” list in 2003.[5]
In 2010, Wiesenthal was an inductee of the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders, along with Sergey Brin of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Peter Thiel of PayPal, and others.[28]
In 2014, he was named to the Billboard Power 100, an annual survey of the most powerful people in the music business as determined by Billboard Magazine.[29]
In October, 2015, the company he co-founded, BLADE, was named one the "100 Hottest Startups in New York City" as determined by Business Insider. [30]
He serves on the Board of Directors of Entercom Communications Corp., the fourth largest radio broadcaster in the U.S., TripAdvisor, Inc. (The 2nd largest East Coast-based Internet company by market capitalization.), global pay-TV network operator Starz as well as Jawbone, a leading connected consumer device company specializing in personal wellness technology and audio products.[31]
He is a mentor of Techstars NYC (www.techstars.com) a mentorship-driven start-up accelerator and seed fund that helps emerging digital companies launch and obtain strategic funding. [32]
Personal life[edit]
Wiesenthal lives in New York City. He had raced Formula Ford cars in the U.S. which led to passion of car collecting and subsequently to creating with a partner the Bridgehampton Motoring Club, the leading Active Storage Collector car facility in the U.S.[33]
During Roger Waters' 2010 U.S. tour "The Wall", Wiesenthal played ukulele with Waters and his band during a set for two dates at Madison Square Garden.[34]
Wiesenthal was previously married to Goldman Sachs managing director Linnea Conrad.[35] They have one son (born 1997).[36]

Early life[edit]
Wiesenthal was raised in Manhattan, New York City, and shared a love of gadgets and entertainment with his father, Richard, who sold “I Love Lucy” reruns for Telepictures in Latin America. He studied robotics in his spare time, and co-wrote a book for Ziff-Davis on personal computers when he was in high school.[5] Wiesenthal graduated from the University of Rochester, receiving a B.A. degree cum laude in Political Science in 1988.
Business career[edit]
Prior to Sony[edit]
Early in his career, Bruce Wasserstein hired Wiesenthal as a junior investment banker at First Boston after he had fixed Wasserstein’s printer, where at the time he was a summer intern providing technical support. “I fixed the right guy’s printer,” he said.[6][7]
At First Boston, he was a member of its Mergers & Acquisitions group, beginning in 1986, later joining their Media group in 1993. He was named Managing Director of Credit Suisse First Boston (or CSFB) in 1999 and headed its entertainment and digital media efforts under Frank Quattrone.
As one of CSFB’s lead media bankers, notable transactions on which he was an advisor included Seagram’s $5.7 billion acquisition of MCA Inc., Liberty Media’s merger with TCI, News Corp’s $3.2 billion purchase of New World Communications and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.’s acquisition of Telemundo, the nation’s second largest Spanish televisioal media sector,.
Sony[edit]
On June 27, 2000, Sir Howard Stringer, Sony Corp.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, hired Wiesenthal as Chief Strategic Officer for Sony Broadband Entertainment , a move described in Fortune as one of Stringer’s “smartest moves”.[8] Sony Broadband Entertainment (now known as Sony Entertainment) was established in March 2000 to house the corporation’s U.S. entertainment assets, its film and television studio and music group.
Wiesenthal moved quickly to buy and sell stakes in a variety of businesses; in 2001, he sold 50 percent of Sony’s Game Show Network to Liberty Digital, and Sony’s stake in Telemundo to NBCUniversal, a deal worth over $2 billion. He had Sony join with Philips N.V. to buy InterTrust Technologies, the owner of patents for most digital-rights-management technologies. He negotiated "strategic transactions" between Sony and Yahoo Inc. and then-AOL Time Warner Inc. At Sony Pictures Entertainment, he oversaw a corporate restructuring called "the 21st Century Studio Project," that resulted in savings of over $150 million at Sony’s studio operations. Among the biggest changes was at Sony Pictures’ U.S. network television production, where he greatly reduced the number of television series it produced. Wiesenthal told The New York Times, "We asked ourselves the tough questions in each of Sony Pictures’ businesses to ensure the underlying economics made sense in the current environment."[9]
On January 16, 2002, Wiesenthal was promoted to Sony's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, a move that the Wall Street Journal described as a strategy that Sony used to improve its stature in the business world. In April 2003, he was named to a seven-member committee of executives to oversee the operations of Sony Pictures Entertainment. In June, 2005, after Stringer was promoted to Chief Executive of Sony Corporation, he gave Wiesenthal the additional responsibility of head of corporate development and mergers and acquisitions for Sony Corporation. During his tenure, Wiesenthal oversaw all financial aspects of Sony Corporation of America across its operating companies, including budget setting, long range planning, capital, and financing decisions. He was also responsible for Sony's U.S. Investor Relations activities. He was a member of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s Operating Committee and was on the Boards of Directors of Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.
In late 2005, after being given responsibility for Sony's Music publishing joint venture, Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal sent a fax to Michael Jackson knowing that the pop singer (who died June 25, 2009) was about to default on a loan secured by his stake in the venture and offered to discuss ways to help. Sony did not want Jackson’s portion of Sony/ATV to wind up in bankruptcy court. Wiesenthal traveled to the Middle East and met Jackson in Dubai to inform him that Sony had backers from Citi who were willing to refinance his ATV debt on much better terms. In exchange, Sony obtained greater operational control over the business, a right of refusal on his stake, and an option to buy half of Jackson’s half for approximately $250 million.[10] These moves helped consolidate Sony's control of the unit.[11]
After obtaining greater authority over the operations of Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal led Sony/ATV’s acquisitions of the Leiber Stoller and Viacom’s Famous Music catalogs in 2007. In 2007, in an effort to bolster the management strength of Sony’s publishing operations, Wiesenthal recruited Martin Bandier, chairman and co-chief executive of EMI Group’s EMI Music Publishing unit, to be chief executive of the unit.[12] Wiesenthal believes music publishing companies are well equipped to compete and be successful in the music industry of the future. He said, "Lenders—whether private lenders or banks—feel much more comfortable with the credit quality of publishing vs. recorded music. In terms of the banks I speak with, there's clearly an interest on the publishing side."[13]
In 2008, Wiesenthal and his corporate development team enabled Sony to be the first company to transmit a feature film directly to internet-connected televisions that were not covered by conventional cable and satellite distributors. They offered the film Hancock, featuring Will Smith, for a fee to customers with Sony's internet-connected televisions, prior to the film's availability on DVD. At the time, laptops and PC's were largely the only method in which customers could view digital streams of feature content.[14]
Also in 2008, he led the transaction to buy Bertelsmann out of its half of Sony BMG, ending a joint venture formed in 2004. Stringer said the "new Sony Music would give the group 'far more flexibility' to use music in its film and television units, and in electronics, including the Play-Station".[15] Nancy Peretsman of Allen & Co. described Wiesenthal as "relatively egoless" and "always focused on the outcome". In his role at Sony Entertainment, he also oversaw Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which was established in 1995 as a joint venture between Sony and trusts formed by Michael Jackson.

Wiesenthal (born June 22, 1966) is an American businessman.Sponsored LinksUntil June 2012, Wiesenthal was Executive Vice president and Chief Financial Officer of Sony Corporation of America, Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer, Sony Entertainment Inc., and Group Executive, Sony Corporation, leading corporate development, and mergers and acquisitions. From 2012 to June 2015, he was Chief Operating Officer of Warner Music Group. Wiesenthal now heads Blade, an aviation start-up.Early lifeWiesenthal was raised in Manhattan, New York City, and shared a love of gadgets and entertainment with his father, Richard, who sold “I Love Lucy” reruns for Telepictures in Latin America. His mother, Ellen, was a florist. He studied robotics in his spare time, and co-wrote a book for Ziff-Davis on personal computers when he was in high school. Wiesenthal graduated from the University of Rochester, receiving a B.A. degree cum laude in Political Science in 1988.Prior to SonyEarly in his career, Bruce Wasserstein hired Wiesenthal as a junior investment banker at First Boston after he had fixed Wasserstein’s printer, where at the time he was a summer intern providing technical support. “I fixed the right guy’s printer,” he said.At First Boston, he was a member of its Mergers & Acquisitions group, beginning in 1986, later joining their Media group in 1993. He was named Managing Director of Credit Suisse First Boston (or CSFB) in 1999 and headed its entertainment and digital media efforts under Frank Quattrone. He had also been a strategic advisor to Sony Corp. of America since 1995.As one of CSFB’s lead media bankers, notable transactions on which he was an advisor included Seagram’s $5.7 billion acquisition of MCA Inc., Liberty Media’s merger with TCI, News Corp’s $3.2 billion purchase of New World Communications and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.’s acquisition of Telemundo, the nation’s second largest Spanish television network. In the digital media sector, he was involved in Polo Ralph Lauren’s e-commerce joint venture with NBC and IAC’s acquisition of Precision Response Corp.SonyOn June 27, 2000, Sir Howard Stringer, Sony Corp.’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, hired him as Chief Strategic Officer for Sony Broadband Entertainment , a move described in Fortune as one of Stringer’s “smartest moves”. Sony Broadband Entertainment (now known as Sony Entertainment) was established in March 2000 to house the corporation’s U.S. entertainment assets, its film and television studio and music group.Wiesenthal moved quickly to buy and sell stakes in a variety of businesses; in 2001, he sold 50 percent of Sony’s Game Show Network to Liberty Digital, and Sony’s stake in Telemundo to NBCUniversal, a deal worth over $2 billion. He had Sony join with Philips N.V. to buy InterTrust Technologies, the owner of patents for most digital-rights-management technologies. He negotiated “strategic transactions” between Sony and Yahoo Inc. and then-AOL Time Warner Inc. At Sony Pictures Entertainment, he oversaw a corporate restructuring called “the 21st Century Studio Project,” that resulted in savings of over $150 million at Sony’s studio operations. Among the biggest changes was at Sony Pictures’ U.S. network television production, where he greatly reduced the number of television series it produced. Wiesenthal told the New York Times, “We asked ourselves the tough questions in each of Sony Pictures’ businesses to ensure the underlying economics made sense in the current environment.”On January 16, 2002, Wiesenthal was promoted to Sony’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, a move that the Wall Street Journal described as a strategy that Sony used to improve its stature in the business world. In April 2003, he was named to a seven-member committee of executives to oversee the operations of Sony Pictures Entertainment. In June, 2005, after Stringer was promoted to Chief Executive of Sony Corporation, he gave Wiesenthal the additional responsibility of head of corporate development and mergers and acquisitions for Sony Corporation. During his tenure, Wiesenthal oversaw all financial aspects of Sony Corporation of America across its operating companies, including budget setting, long range planning, capital, and financing decisions. He was also responsible for Sony’s U.S. Investor Relations activities. He was a member of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s Operating Committee and was on the Boards of Directors of Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.In late 2005, after being given responsibility for Sony’s Music publishing joint venture, Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal sent a fax to Michael Jackson knowing that the pop singer (who died June 25, 2009) was about to default on a loan secured by his stake in the venture and offered to discuss ways to help:. Sony didn’t want Jackson’s half of Sony/ATV to wind up in bankruptcy court. Wiesenthal traveled to the Middle East and met Jackson in a gilded Dubai hotel room he told Jackson that Sony had backers from Citi who were willing to refinance Jackson’s ATV debt on much better terms. In exchange: Sony obtained greater operational control over the business, a right of refusal on his stake, and an option to buy half of Jackson’s half for approximately $250 million. These moves helped consolidate Sony’s control of the unit.After obtaining greater authority over the operations of Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal led Sony/ATV’s acquisitions of the Leiber Stoller and Viacom’s Famous Music catalogs in 2007. In 2007, in an effort to bolster the management strength of Sony’s publishing operations, Wiesenthal recruited Martin Bandier, chairman and co-chief executive of EMI Group’s EMI Music Publishing unit, to be chief executive of Sony/ATV. Wiesenthal believes music publishing companies are well equipped to compete and be successful in the music industry of the future. Unlike traditional record companies, they don’t have manufacturing sales, distribution, or expensive label structures. And their model is completely based on licensing rights across all users and media. “Lenders—whether private lenders or banks—feel much more comfortable with the credit quality of publishing vs. recorded music,” Wiesenthal said. “In terms of the banks I speak with, there’s clearly an interest on the publishing side.”In 2008, Wiesenthal and his corporate development team enabled Sony to be the first company to transmit a feature film directly to internet-connected televisions that were not covered by conventional cable and satellite distributors. They offered the film Hancock, featuring Will Smith, for a fee to customers with Sony's internet-connected televisions, prior to the film’s availability on DVD. At the time, laptops and PC’s were largely the only method in which customers could view digital streams of feature content. Wiesenthal said at the time, “At the end of the day, (this project) is about bringing digital entertainment back into the living room.” Wiesenthal followed this project with a similar early release of the animated children’s film “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs.” These initiatives provided owners of Sony’s networked televisions with unique opportunities to watch early offerings of exclusive feature films they could not see over any competing television manufacturer’s sets as they were not available on DVD or pay-per-view.Also in 2008, he led the transaction to buy Bertelsmann out of its half of Sony BMG, ending a joint venture formed in 2004. Stringer said the "new Sony Music would give the group ‘far more flexibility’ to use music in its film and television units, and in electronics, including the Play-Station". In a business known for oversized egos, Wiesenthal is described by industry executives as an exception; Nancy Peretsman of Allen & Co. described him as "relatively egoless" and "always focused on the outcome". In his role at Sony Entertainment, he also oversaw Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which was established in 1995 as a joint venture between Sony and trusts formed by Michael Jackson. After separating music publishing from Sony’s music assets after the merger of Sony Music and BMG’s Music Group, Howard Stringer charged Wiesenthal with the responsibility to grow Sony/ATV Music publishing via acquisition, a strategy that had previously fallen to the wayside when the business was previously part of Sony’s Music unit. At the time, Sony/ATV, was the smallest of the major music publishing companies.In 2010, Wiesenthal and David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications, conceived of and structured a partnership bringing together the largest players in 3D to create the world’s first 24-hour 3D network. The network, 3NET, launched on DirecTV in 2011 as a partnership between Sony, Discovery Communications and IMAX. Today 3NET has the largest collection of 3D television content in the world. Sony owns 33% of the venture and Wiesenthal sits on its board of directors. Wiesenthal also championed the Sony Dash, the world’s first Internet connected alarm clock for the bedside or desktop. The Dash provides an always on, sequential display of over 1,500 apps, including Facebook status updates, Twitter streams, and news and weather updates. It is one of only a handful of Sony consumer electronics products developed in the United States.In 2011, Wiesenthal orchestrated a complex deal acquiring EMI Publishing for $2.2 billion to an investor consortium led by Sony. The investor group included media mogul David Geffen, the estate of Michael Jackson, Blackstone’s GSO’s Capital Partners, Mubadala Development Company (the investment arm of Abu Dhabi), and Jynwel Capital of Hong Kong. “We found long-term investors, who are not just looking at the short-term returns typical of private equity,” Wiesenthal said. The New York Times, in a Deals of the Year wrap-up, called it the “sleeper deal of 2011,” one that “might have been the most interesting.” Billboard described Wiesenthal as a “winner” in the deal: he helped assemble a consortium of investors to buy EMI Music Publishing. As a result of the transaction, Sony now controls the largest collection of publishing copyrights in the world.” Bob Pittman, CEO of Clear Channel Communications said, "He took it from being insignificant to being the biggest."As Sony entered the tablet market in 2011, Wiesenthal publicly discussed the important role of the marriage of tablets and television can play in the emerging connected television business. He told a Goldman Sachs conference in New York that, although five years previously, “it was all about the boxes; TiVo, Slingbox, Roku, I think the consumers really have box exhaustion.” In their place, TVs can evolve so they only have one wire: the power cord. Consumers, in turn, he said, will use tablets to access video content from the Cloud and control the TV screen; a user with a subscription to Sony’s Video Unlimited or Netflix could take a tablet to a friend’s house and “throw” a film to that friend’s TV.Warner Music GroupIn January 2, 2013, Wiesenthal was hired as Chief Operating Office, Warner Music Group in an effort to bolster the company's M&A, corporate development, and digital initiatives.In early 2013, Wiesenthal played a key role in the Company's acquisition of Parlophone, one of the world's leading recorded music companies and home to Coldplay, David Guetta, and Pink Floyd.In September 2013, Wiesenthal led the effort to architect and launch a multi-platform alliance between Warner Music Group and Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio station operator in the United States. The New York Times said the deal. "re-writes the rules on royalties". Under the alliance, Warner Music Group became the very first major music company to receive royalties for their artists for radio airplay. Additionally, the deal restructured the way the two companies economically interface on iHeart custom digital radio as well as their multitude of online simulcast radio station. The intent of the restructuring was to result in favorable to economics to both Warner Music Group and Clear Channel as well as to increase Warner Music Group's market share over IHeart radio versus its major label competitors. The Wall Street Journal said. "If Clear Channel uses more of Warner Music’s records on its digital platforms, for example, that could translate to more terrestrial radio plays..." As part of the deal, Clear Channel offered Warner Music an “enhanced” version of its “artist integration” initiative, which advertises emerging artists on the air at Clear Channel’s expense. Clear Channel offers other labels such promotions for just several weeks surrounding a new release, but for Warner Music’s artists, the promotions will run up to 15 weeks. In the same Wall Street Journal article, Wiesenthal said, "Clear Channel’s high-visibility live and televised events, as well as its digital services, will enable us propel our artists’ careers in an extremely competitive marketplace.”In February 2014, Wiesenthal conceived and led the creation of a broad alliance with music discovery Shazam. The alliance provides Warner Music Group unique granular access to the Shazam's user data to help find music acts early in their careers. Acts found through the usage data of Shazam's 300 million users, have the opportunity to be signed to a Shazam branded label under the Warner Music Group.Prior to joining Warner Music Group in 2013, Wiesenthal had founded Blade, the first crowdsourced short distance aviation company. In June 2014, it was announced that Wiesenthal would leave Time Warner and work full-time in Blade as the latter's leader.AchievementsCrain’s New York Business named him on its “40 Under 40” list in 2003.In 2007, the World Economic Forum named Wiesenthal a “Global Leader for Tomorrow.”In 2014, he was named to the Billboard Power 100, an annual survey of the most powerful people in the music business as determined by Billboard Magazine.He serves on the Board of Directors of Entercom Communications Corp., the fourth largest radio broadcaster in the U.S., TripAdvisor, Inc. (The 2nd largest East Coast-based Internet company by market capitalization.), global pay-TV network operator Starz as well as Jawbone, a leading connected consumer device company specializing in personal wellness technology and audio products.He is a mentor of TechStars NYC (www.techstars.org) an elite mentorship-driven start-up accelerator and seed fund that helps emerging digital companies in New York launch and obtain strategic funding.Personal lifeWiesenthal lives in New York City. Throughout college and for a short time after graduation, he raced Formula Ford cars in the U.S. That led to passion of car collecting and subsequently to creating with a partner the Bridgehampton Motoring Club, the leading Active Storage Collector car facility in the U.S.During Roger Waters' 2010 U.S. tour "The Wall", Wiesenthal played ukulele with Waters and his band during a set for two dates at Madison Square Garden.Wiesenthal was previously married to Goldman Sachs managing director Linnea Conrad. They have one son (born 1997).ReferencesRobert S.

Rob Wiesenthal Named President, International of Sony/ATV Music Publishing
Sony Corporation of America - 03/29/2012
NEW YORK, March 29, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Sony/ATV Music Publishing announced today that Robert S. Wiesenthal has been named President, International. Mr. Wiesenthal will join the company in this newly formed role on June 27, 2012 and will be based in New York, reporting to Martin Bandier, Chairman & CEO of Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Sony/ATV Music Publishing is a joint venture between Sony Corporation and the Estate of Michael Jackson. 
As President of International, Mr. Wiesenthal will be chiefly responsible for oversight of all territories worldwide excluding North America and the UK. He will work closely with the heads of the various territories to develop, promote and implement the strategic goals of the company. 
Mr. Wiesenthal will also play a key role in the future integration of EMI Music Publishing's international operations, which is subject to regulatory approval. As was announced in November 2011, an investor group that includes Sony Corporation of America, in conjunction with the Estate of Michael Jackson; Mubadala Development Company PJSC; Jynwel Capital Limited; the Blackstone Group's GSO Capital Partners LP; and David Geffen signed an agreement to acquire EMI Music Publishing. Subject to regulatory approval, Sony/ATV Music Publishing will help oversee EMI Music Publishing. Mr. Wiesenthal played an instrumental role in the proposed acquisition by assembling the group of investors and helping to secure the necessary financing. 
In addition, Mr. Wiesenthal will become part of Sony/ATV's senior executive management team and will thus advise Mr. Bandier on new business initiatives, strategic partnerships and other potential opportunities to enhance Sony/ATV's business operations.
"I am happy that Rob has accepted my invitation to join the Sony/ATV team at this important time," said Martin Bandier, Chairman & CEO, Sony/ATV Music Publishing. "Rob's job experiences have provided him with a distinct business perspective that I know will be helpful to us in his new role. As the music publishing industry continues to evolve to meet the demands of a digital world, Rob will assist Sony/ATV's international businesses to meet these challenges head-on. I am excited to welcome him to the company and very much look forward to working with him for years to come."
"With his insights into how to use content to make devices come alive and through numerous business initiatives across our operating divisions, Rob helped us as we moved from the analog to the digital world," said Sir Howard Stringer, Chairman, CEO and President of Sony Corporation. "Rob's business acumen has always played a crucial role in our corporate efforts to grow the various operating companies, most recently with the proposed acquisition of EMI Music Publishing by Sony and our partners.  I am pleased he has agreed to join the successful team at Sony/ATV."
For the past 12 years, Mr. Wiesenthal has held various positions at Sony, most recently as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sony Corporation of America.  
During his Sony career, Mr. Wiesenthal has overseen M&A activities, strategy and corporate development. In 2008, he led an effort to enable Sony to be the first company ever to transmit feature films directly to Internet-connected televisions outside conventional cable and satellite distributors.
In 2010, Mr. Wiesenthal helped create a joint venture bringing together the largest players in 3D to create the world's first 24-hour 3D network. The network, 3NET, launched on DirecTV in 2011 as a partnership between Sony, Discovery Communications and IMAX. Today, 3NET has the largest collection of 3D television content in the world. The initiative leverages Sony's combined strength in 3D capture, 3D televisions and 3D content.
Prior to joining Sony in 2000, Mr. Wiesenthal was Managing Director of Credit Suisse First Boston (or CSFB) where he headed its entertainment practice and digital media efforts. During this time, he was a strategic advisor to Sony Corporation of America.
ABOUT SONY/ATV MUSIC PUBLISHINGSony/ATV Music Publishing was established in 1995 as a joint venture between Sony and trusts formed by Michael Jackson. Sony/ATV Music Publishing owns or administers over 750,000 copyrights by such artists as The Beatles, Brooks & Dunn, Leonard Cohen, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, Fall Out Boy, Lady Gaga, Kraftwerk, Jessie J, John Mayer, Joni Mitchell, Graham Nash, Willie Nelson, Roy Orbison, Linda Perry, Richie Sambora, Shakira, Taylor Swift, Wyclef Jean, Hank Williams and KT Tunstall, among others.

Early life[edit]
Wiesenthal was raised in Manhattan, New York City, and shared a love of gadgets and entertainment with his father, Richard, who sold “I Love Lucy” reruns for Telepictures in Latin America. He studied robotics in his spare time, and co-wrote a book for Ziff-Davis on personal computers when he was in high school.[5] Wiesenthal graduated from the University of Rochester, receiving a B.A. degree cum laude in Political Science in 1988.
Business career[edit]
Prior to Sony[edit]
Early in his career, Bruce Wasserstein hired Wiesenthal as a junior investment banker at First Boston after he had fixed Wasserstein’s printer, where at the time he was a summer intern providing technical support. “I fixed the right guy’s printer,” he said.[6][7]
At First Boston, he was a member of its Mergers & Acquisitions group, beginning in 1986, later joining their Media group in 1993. He was named Managing Director of Credit Suisse First Boston (or CSFB) in 1999 and headed its entertainment and digital media efforts under Frank Quattrone.
As one of CSFB’s lead media bankers, notable transactions on which he was an advisor included Seagram’s $5.7 billion acquisition of MCA Inc., Liberty Media’s merger with TCI, News Corp’s $3.2 billion purchase of New World Communications and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.’s acquisition of Telemundo, the nation’s second largest Spanish televisioal media sector,.
Sony[edit]
On June 27, 2000, Sir Howard Stringer, Sony Corp.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, hired Wiesenthal as Chief Strategic Officer for Sony Broadband Entertainment , a move described in Fortune as one of Stringer’s “smartest moves”.[8] Sony Broadband Entertainment (now known as Sony Entertainment) was established in March 2000 to house the corporation’s U.S. entertainment assets, its film and television studio and music group.
Wiesenthal moved quickly to buy and sell stakes in a variety of businesses; in 2001, he sold 50 percent of Sony’s Game Show Network to Liberty Digital, and Sony’s stake in Telemundo to NBCUniversal, a deal worth over $2 billion. He had Sony join with Philips N.V. to buy InterTrust Technologies, the owner of patents for most digital-rights-management technologies. He negotiated "strategic transactions" between Sony and Yahoo Inc. and then-AOL Time Warner Inc. At Sony Pictures Entertainment, he oversaw a corporate restructuring called "the 21st Century Studio Project," that resulted in savings of over $150 million at Sony’s studio operations. Among the biggest changes was at Sony Pictures’ U.S. network television production, where he greatly reduced the number of television series it produced. Wiesenthal told The New York Times, "We asked ourselves the tough questions in each of Sony Pictures’ businesses to ensure the underlying economics made sense in the current environment."[9]
On January 16, 2002, Wiesenthal was promoted to Sony's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, a move that the Wall Street Journal described as a strategy that Sony used to improve its stature in the business world. In April 2003, he was named to a seven-member committee of executives to oversee the operations of Sony Pictures Entertainment. In June, 2005, after Stringer was promoted to Chief Executive of Sony Corporation, he gave Wiesenthal the additional responsibility of head of corporate development and mergers and acquisitions for Sony Corporation. During his tenure, Wiesenthal oversaw all financial aspects of Sony Corporation of America across its operating companies, including budget setting, long range planning, capital, and financing decisions. He was also responsible for Sony's U.S. Investor Relations activities. He was a member of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s Operating Committee and was on the Boards of Directors of Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.
In late 2005, after being given responsibility for Sony's Music publishing joint venture, Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal sent a fax to Michael Jackson knowing that the pop singer (who died June 25, 2009) was about to default on a loan secured by his stake in the venture and offered to discuss ways to help. Sony did not want Jackson’s portion of Sony/ATV to wind up in bankruptcy court. Wiesenthal traveled to the Middle East and met Jackson in Dubai to inform him that Sony had backers from Citi who were willing to refinance his ATV debt on much better terms. In exchange, Sony obtained greater operational control over the business, a right of refusal on his stake, and an option to buy half of Jackson’s half for approximately $250 million.[10] These moves helped consolidate Sony's control of the unit.[11]
After obtaining greater authority over the operations of Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal led Sony/ATV’s acquisitions of the Leiber Stoller and Viacom’s Famous Music catalogs in 2007. In 2007, in an effort to bolster the management strength of Sony’s publishing operations, Wiesenthal recruited Martin Bandier, chairman and co-chief executive of EMI Group’s EMI Music Publishing unit, to be chief executive of the unit.[12] Wiesenthal believes music publishing companies are well equipped to compete and be successful in the music industry of the future. He said, "Lenders—whether private lenders or banks—feel much more comfortable with the credit quality of publishing vs. recorded music. In terms of the banks I speak with, there's clearly an interest on the publishing side."[13]
In 2008, Wiesenthal and his corporate development team enabled Sony to be the first company to transmit a feature film directly to internet-connected televisions that were not covered by conventional cable and satellite distributors. They offered the film Hancock, featuring Will Smith, for a fee to customers with Sony's internet-connected televisions, prior to the film's availability on DVD. At the time, laptops and PC's were largely the only method in which customers could view digital streams of feature content.[14]
Also in 2008, he led the transaction to buy Bertelsmann out of its half of Sony BMG, ending a joint venture formed in 2004. Stringer said the "new Sony Music would give the group 'far more flexibility' to use music in its film and television units, and in electronics, including the Play-Station".[15] Nancy Peretsman of Allen & Co. described Wiesenthal as "relatively egoless" and "always focused on the outcome". In his role at Sony Entertainment, he also oversaw Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which was established in 1995 as a joint venture between Sony and trusts formed by Michael Jackson.
After separating music publishing from Sony's music assets after the merger of Sony Music and BMG’s Music Group, Howard Stringer charged Wiesenthal with the responsibility to grow Sony/ATV Music publishing via acquisition, a strategy that had previously fallen to the wayside when the business was previously part of Sony's Music unit.[16] At the time, Sony/ATV, was the smallest of the major music publishing companies.
In 2010, Wiesenthal and David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications, conceived of and structured a partnership bringing together the largest players in 3D to create the world’s first 24-hour 3D network. The network, 3NET, launched on DirecTV in 2011 as a partnership between Sony, Discovery Communications and IMAX. Sony owns 33% of the venture and Wiesenthal sits on its board of directors.[17] Wiesenthal also championed the Sony Dash, the world's first Internet connected alarm clock for the bedside or desktop.[18]
In 2011, Wiesenthal orchestrated a complex deal acquiring EMI Publishing for $2.2 billion to an investor consortium led by Sony. The investor group included media mogul David Geffen, the estate of Michael Jackson, Blackstone’s GSO’s Capital Partners, Mubadala Development Company (the investment arm of Abu Dhabi), and Jynwel Capital of Hong Kong. "We found long-term investors, who are not just looking at the short-term returns typical of private equity," Wiesenthal said.[19] The New York Times, in a Deals of the Year wrap-up, called it the "sleeper deal of 2011," one that "might have been the most interesting."[20] Billboard described Wiesenthal as a "winner" in the deal: he helped assemble a consortium of investors to buy EMI Music Publishing. As a result of the transaction, Sony now controls the largest collection of publishing copyrights in the world.”[21] Bob Pittman, CEO of Clear Channel Communications said, "He took it from being insignificant to being the biggest."[22]
As Sony entered the tablet market in 2011, Wiesenthal publicly discussed the important role of the marriage of tablets and television can play in the emerging connected television business. He told a Goldman Sachs conference in New York that, although five years previously, "it was all about the boxes; TiVo, Slingbox, Roku, I think the consumers really have box exhaustion." In their place, TVs can evolve so they only have one wire: the power cord. Consumers, in turn, he said, will use tablets to access video content from the Cloud and control the TV screen.[23]
Warner Music Group[edit]
In January 2, 2013, Wiesenthal was hired as Chief Operating Office, Warner Music Group in an effort to bolster the company's M&A, corporate development, and digital initiatives.[3]
In early 2013, Wiesenthal played a key role in the Company's acquisition of Parlophone, one of the world's leading recorded music companies and home to Coldplay, David Guetta, and Pink Floyd.[24]
In September 2013, Wiesenthal led the effort to architect and launch a multi-platform alliance between Warner Music Group and Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio station operator in the United States. The New York Times said the deal, "re-writes the rules on royalties". [25]
Prior to joining Warner Music Group in 2013, Wiesenthal founded Blade, the first crowdsourced short distance aviation company.[26] In June 2014, Wiesenthal said he would leave Time Warner and work full-time in Blade as the latter's leader.[4]
In 2015, Wiesenthal negotiated an alliance on behalf of Warner Music Group with Snapchat to become the very first music company to have a channel on the Discover platform. With the Discover feature, companies could refresh “videos daily [and] create major promotional opportunities that [would] be monetized through sponsorship and advertising,” Wiesenthal stated in an interview with Billboard.

Early life[edit]
Wiesenthal was raised in Manhattan, New York City, and shared a love of gadgets and entertainment with his father, Richard, who sold “I Love Lucy” reruns for Telepictures in Latin America. He studied robotics in his spare time, and co-wrote a book for Ziff-Davis on personal computers when he was in high school.[5] Wiesenthal graduated from the University of Rochester, receiving a B.A. degree cum laude in Political Science in 1988.
Business career[edit]
Prior to Sony[edit]
Early in his career, Bruce Wasserstein hired Wiesenthal as a junior investment banker at First Boston after he had fixed Wasserstein’s printer, where at the time he was a summer intern providing technical support. “I fixed the right guy’s printer,” he said.[6][7]
At First Boston, he was a member of its Mergers & Acquisitions group, beginning in 1986, later joining their Media group in 1993. He was named Managing Director of Credit Suisse First Boston (or CSFB) in 1999 and headed its entertainment and digital media efforts under Frank Quattrone.
As one of CSFB’s lead media bankers, notable transactions on which he was an advisor included Seagram’s $5.7 billion acquisition of MCA Inc., Liberty Media’s merger with TCI, News Corp’s $3.2 billion purchase of New World Communications and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.’s acquisition of Telemundo, the nation’s second largest Spanish televisioal media sector,.
Sony[edit]
On June 27, 2000, Sir Howard Stringer, Sony Corp.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, hired Wiesenthal as Chief Strategic Officer for Sony Broadband Entertainment , a move described in Fortune as one of Stringer’s “smartest moves”.[8] Sony Broadband Entertainment (now known as Sony Entertainment) was established in March 2000 to house the corporation’s U.S. entertainment assets, its film and television studio and music group.
Wiesenthal moved quickly to buy and sell stakes in a variety of businesses; in 2001, he sold 50 percent of Sony’s Game Show Network to Liberty Digital, and Sony’s stake in Telemundo to NBCUniversal, a deal worth over $2 billion. He had Sony join with Philips N.V. to buy InterTrust Technologies, the owner of patents for most digital-rights-management technologies. He negotiated "strategic transactions" between Sony and Yahoo Inc. and then-AOL Time Warner Inc. At Sony Pictures Entertainment, he oversaw a corporate restructuring called "the 21st Century Studio Project," that resulted in savings of over $150 million at Sony’s studio operations. Among the biggest changes was at Sony Pictures’ U.S. network television production, where he greatly reduced the number of television series it produced. Wiesenthal told The New York Times, "We asked ourselves the tough questions in each of Sony Pictures’ businesses to ensure the underlying economics made sense in the current environment."[9]
On January 16, 2002, Wiesenthal was promoted to Sony's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, a move that the Wall Street Journal described as a strategy that Sony used to improve its stature in the business world. In April 2003, he was named to a seven-member committee of executives to oversee the operations of Sony Pictures Entertainment. In June, 2005, after Stringer was promoted to Chief Executive of Sony Corporation, he gave Wiesenthal the additional responsibility of head of corporate development and mergers and acquisitions for Sony Corporation. During his tenure, Wiesenthal oversaw all financial aspects of Sony Corporation of America across its operating companies, including budget setting, long range planning, capital, and financing decisions. He was also responsible for Sony's U.S. Investor Relations activities. He was a member of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s Operating Committee and was on the Boards of Directors of Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.
In late 2005, after being given responsibility for Sony's Music publishing joint venture, Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal sent a fax to Michael Jackson knowing that the pop singer (who died June 25, 2009) was about to default on a loan secured by his stake in the venture and offered to discuss ways to help. Sony did not want Jackson’s portion of Sony/ATV to wind up in bankruptcy court. Wiesenthal traveled to the Middle East and met Jackson in Dubai to inform him that Sony had backers from Citi who were willing to refinance his ATV debt on much better terms. In exchange, Sony obtained greater operational control over the business, a right of refusal on his stake, and an option to buy half of Jackson’s half for approximately $250 million.[10] These moves helped consolidate Sony's control of the unit.[11]
After obtaining greater authority over the operations of Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal led Sony/ATV’s acquisitions of the Leiber Stoller and Viacom’s Famous Music catalogs in 2007. In 2007, in an effort to bolster the management strength of Sony’s publishing operations, Wiesenthal recruited Martin Bandier, chairman and co-chief executive of EMI Group’s EMI Music Publishing unit, to be chief executive of the unit.[12] Wiesenthal believes music publishing companies are well equipped to compete and be successful in the music industry of the future. He said, "Lenders—whether private lenders or banks—feel much more comfortable with the credit quality of publishing vs. recorded music. In terms of the banks I speak with, there's clearly an interest on the publishing side."[13]
In 2008, Wiesenthal and his corporate development team enabled Sony to be the first company to transmit a feature film directly to internet-connected televisions that were not covered by conventional cable and satellite distributors. They offered the film Hancock, featuring Will Smith, for a fee to customers with Sony's internet-connected televisions, prior to the film's availability on DVD. At the time, laptops and PC's were largely the only method in which customers could view digital streams of feature content.[14]
Also in 2008, he led the transaction to buy Bertelsmann out of its half of Sony BMG, ending a joint venture formed in 2004. Stringer said the "new Sony Music would give the group 'far more flexibility' to use music in its film and television units, and in electronics, including the Play-Station".[15] Nancy Peretsman of Allen & Co. described Wiesenthal as "relatively egoless" and "always focused on the outcome". In his role at Sony Entertainment, he also oversaw Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which was established in 1995 as a joint venture between Sony and trusts formed by Michael Jackson.
After separating music publishing from Sony's music assets after the merger of Sony Music and BMG’s Music Group, Howard Stringer charged Wiesenthal with the responsibility to grow Sony/ATV Music publishing via acquisition, a strategy that had previously fallen to the wayside when the business was previously part of Sony's Music unit.[16] At the time, Sony/ATV, was the smallest of the major music publishing companies.
In 2010, Wiesenthal and David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications, conceived of and structured a partnership bringing together the largest players in 3D to create the world’s first 24-hour 3D network. The network, 3NET, launched on DirecTV in 2011 as a partnership between Sony, Discovery Communications and IMAX. Sony owns 33% of the venture and Wiesenthal sits on its board of directors.[17] Wiesenthal also championed the Sony Dash, the world's first Internet connected alarm clock for the bedside or desktop.[18]
In 2011, Wiesenthal orchestrated a complex deal acquiring EMI Publishing for $2.2 billion to an investor consortium led by Sony. The investor group included media mogul David Geffen, the estate of Michael Jackson, Blackstone’s GSO’s Capital Partners, Mubadala Development Company (the investment arm of Abu Dhabi), and Jynwel Capital of Hong Kong. "We found long-term investors, who are not just looking at the short-term returns typical of private equity," Wiesenthal said.[19] The New York Times, in a Deals of the Year wrap-up, called it the "sleeper deal of 2011," one that "might have been the most interesting."[20] Billboard described Wiesenthal as a "winner" in the deal: he helped assemble a consortium of investors to buy EMI Music Publishing. As a result of the transaction, Sony now controls the largest collection of publishing copyrights in the world.”[21] Bob Pittman, CEO of Clear Channel Communications said, "He took it from being insignificant to being the biggest."[22]
As Sony entered the tablet market in 2011, Wiesenthal publicly discussed the important role of the marriage of tablets and television can play in the emerging connected television business. He told a Goldman Sachs conference in New York that, although five years previously, "it was all about the boxes; TiVo, Slingbox, Roku, I think the consumers really have box exhaustion." In their place, TVs can evolve so they only have one wire: the power cord. Consumers, in turn, he said, will use tablets to access video content from the Cloud and control the TV screen.[23]
Warner Music Group[edit]
In January 2, 2013, Wiesenthal was hired as Chief Operating Office, Warner Music Group in an effort to bolster the company's M&A, corporate development, and digital initiatives.[3]
In early 2013, Wiesenthal played a key role in the Company's acquisition of Parlophone, one of the world's leading recorded music companies and home to Coldplay, David Guetta, and Pink Floyd.[24]
In September 2013, Wiesenthal led the effort to architect and launch a multi-platform alliance between Warner Music Group and Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio station operator in the United States. The New York Times said the deal, "re-writes the rules on royalties". [25]
Prior to joining Warner Music Group in 2013, Wiesenthal founded Blade, the first crowdsourced short distance aviation company.[26] In June 2014, Wiesenthal said he would leave Time Warner and work full-time in Blade as the latter's leader.[4]
In 2015, Wiesenthal negotiated an alliance on behalf of Warner Music Group with Snapchat to become the very first music company to have a channel on the Discover platform. With the Discover feature, companies could refresh “videos daily [and] create major promotional opportunities that [would] be monetized through sponsorship and advertising,” Wiesenthal stated in an interview with Billboard. Under the Warner Music Group section, Snapchat users could view sneak-peaks of music videos, daily headlines, advertisements, and promotions.[27]
Achievements[edit]
Crain’s New York Business named him on its “40 Under 40” list in 2003.[5]
In 2010, Wiesenthal was an inductee of the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders, along with Sergey Brin of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Peter Thiel of PayPal, and others.[28]
In 2014, he was named to the Billboard Power 100, an annual survey of the most powerful people in the music business as determined by Billboard Magazine.[29]
In October, 2015, the company he co-founded, BLADE, was named one the "100 Hottest Startups in New York City" as determined by Business Insider. [30]
He serves on the Board of Directors of Entercom Communications Corp., the fourth largest radio broadcaster in the U.S., TripAdvisor, Inc. (The 2nd largest East Coast-based Internet company by market capitalization.), global pay-TV network operator Starz as well as Jawbone, a leading connected consumer device company specializing in personal wellness technology and audio products.[31]
He is a mentor of Techstars NYC (www.techstars.com) a mentorship-driven start-up accelerator and seed fund that helps emerging digital companies launch and obtain strategic funding. [32]
Personal life[edit]
Wiesenthal lives in New York City. He had raced Formula Ford cars in the U.S. which led to passion of car collecting and subsequently to creating with a partner the Bridgehampton Motoring Club, the leading Active Storage Collector car facility in the U.S.[33]
During Roger Waters' 2010 U.S. tour "The Wall", Wiesenthal played ukulele with Waters and his band during a set for two dates at Madison Square Garden.[34]
Wiesenthal was previously married to Goldman Sachs managing director Linnea Conrad.[35] They have one son (born 1997).[36]

Early life[edit]
Wiesenthal was raised in Manhattan, New York City, and shared a love of gadgets and entertainment with his father, Richard, who sold “I Love Lucy” reruns for Telepictures in Latin America. He studied robotics in his spare time, and co-wrote a book for Ziff-Davis on personal computers when he was in high school.[5] Wiesenthal graduated from the University of Rochester, receiving a B.A. degree cum laude in Political Science in 1988.
Business career[edit]
Prior to Sony[edit]
Early in his career, Bruce Wasserstein hired Wiesenthal as a junior investment banker at First Boston after he had fixed Wasserstein’s printer, where at the time he was a summer intern providing technical support. “I fixed the right guy’s printer,” he said.[6][7]
At First Boston, he was a member of its Mergers & Acquisitions group, beginning in 1986, later joining their Media group in 1993. He was named Managing Director of Credit Suisse First Boston (or CSFB) in 1999 and headed its entertainment and digital media efforts under Frank Quattrone.
As one of CSFB’s lead media bankers, notable transactions on which he was an advisor included Seagram’s $5.7 billion acquisition of MCA Inc., Liberty Media’s merger with TCI, News Corp’s $3.2 billion purchase of New World Communications and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.’s acquisition of Telemundo, the nation’s second largest Spanish televisioal media sector,.
Sony[edit]
On June 27, 2000, Sir Howard Stringer, Sony Corp.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, hired Wiesenthal as Chief Strategic Officer for Sony Broadband Entertainment , a move described in Fortune as one of Stringer’s “smartest moves”.[8] Sony Broadband Entertainment (now known as Sony Entertainment) was established in March 2000 to house the corporation’s U.S. entertainment assets, its film and television studio and music group.
Wiesenthal moved quickly to buy and sell stakes in a variety of businesses; in 2001, he sold 50 percent of Sony’s Game Show Network to Liberty Digital, and Sony’s stake in Telemundo to NBCUniversal, a deal worth over $2 billion. He had Sony join with Philips N.V. to buy InterTrust Technologies, the owner of patents for most digital-rights-management technologies. He negotiated "strategic transactions" between Sony and Yahoo Inc. and then-AOL Time Warner Inc. At Sony Pictures Entertainment, he oversaw a corporate restructuring called "the 21st Century Studio Project," that resulted in savings of over $150 million at Sony’s studio operations. Among the biggest changes was at Sony Pictures’ U.S. network television production, where he greatly reduced the number of television series it produced. Wiesenthal told The New York Times, "We asked ourselves the tough questions in each of Sony Pictures’ businesses to ensure the underlying economics made sense in the current environment."[9]
On January 16, 2002, Wiesenthal was promoted to Sony's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, a move that the Wall Street Journal described as a strategy that Sony used to improve its stature in the business world. In April 2003, he was named to a seven-member committee of executives to oversee the operations of Sony Pictures Entertainment. In June, 2005, after Stringer was promoted to Chief Executive of Sony Corporation, he gave Wiesenthal the additional responsibility of head of corporate development and mergers and acquisitions for Sony Corporation. During his tenure, Wiesenthal oversaw all financial aspects of Sony Corporation of America across its operating companies, including budget setting, long range planning, capital, and financing decisions. He was also responsible for Sony's U.S. Investor Relations activities. He was a member of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s Operating Committee and was on the Boards of Directors of Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.
In late 2005, after being given responsibility for Sony's Music publishing joint venture, Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal sent a fax to Michael Jackson knowing that the pop singer (who died June 25, 2009) was about to default on a loan secured by his stake in the venture and offered to discuss ways to help. Sony did not want Jackson’s portion of Sony/ATV to wind up in bankruptcy court. Wiesenthal traveled to the Middle East and met Jackson in Dubai to inform him that Sony had backers from Citi who were willing to refinance his ATV debt on much better terms. In exchange, Sony obtained greater operational control over the business, a right of refusal on his stake, and an option to buy half of Jackson’s half for approximately $250 million.[10] These moves helped consolidate Sony's control of the unit.[11]
After obtaining greater authority over the operations of Sony/ATV, Wiesenthal led Sony/ATV’s acquisitions of the Leiber Stoller and Viacom’s Famous Music catalogs in 2007. In 2007, in an effort to bolster the management strength of Sony’s publishing operations, Wiesenthal recruited Martin Bandier, chairman and co-chief executive of EMI Group’s EMI Music Publishing unit, to be chief executive of the unit.[12] Wiesenthal believes music publishing companies are well equipped to compete and be successful in the music industry of the future. He said, "Lenders—whether private lenders or banks—feel much more comfortable with the credit quality of publishing vs. recorded music. In terms of the banks I speak with, there's clearly an interest on the publishing side."[13]
In 2008, Wiesenthal and his corporate development team enabled Sony to be the first company to transmit a feature film directly to internet-connected televisions that were not covered by conventional cable and satellite distributors. They offered the film Hancock, featuring Will Smith, for a fee to customers with Sony's internet-connected televisions, prior to the film's availability on DVD. At the time, laptops and PC's were largely the only method in which customers could view digital streams of feature content.[14]
Also in 2008, he led the transaction to buy Bertelsmann out of its half of Sony BMG, ending a joint venture formed in 2004. Stringer said the "new Sony Music would give the group 'far more flexibility' to use music in its film and television units, and in electronics, including the Play-Station".[15] Nancy Peretsman of Allen & Co. described Wiesenthal as "relatively egoless" and "always focused on the outcome". In his role at Sony Entertainment, he also oversaw Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which was established in 1995 as a joint venture between Sony and trusts formed by Michael Jackson.
After separating music publishing from Sony's music assets after the merger of Sony Music and BMG’s Music Group, Howard Stringer charged Wiesenthal with the responsibility to grow Sony/ATV Music publishing via acquisition, a strategy that had previously fallen to the wayside when the business was previously part of Sony's Music unit.[16] At the time, Sony/ATV, was the smallest of the major music publishing companies.
In 2010, Wiesenthal and David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications, conceived of and structured a partnership bringing together the largest players in 3D to create the world’s first 24-hour 3D network. The network, 3NET, launched on DirecTV in 2011 as a partnership between Sony, Discovery Communications and IMAX. Sony owns 33% of the venture and Wiesenthal sits on its board of directors.[17] Wiesenthal also championed the Sony Dash, the world's first Internet connected alarm clock for the bedside or desktop.[18]
In 2011, Wiesenthal orchestrated a complex deal acquiring EMI Publishing for $2.2 billion to an investor consortium led by Sony. The investor group included media mogul David Geffen, the estate of Michael Jackson, Blackstone’s GSO’s Capital Partners, Mubadala Development Company (the investment arm of Abu Dhabi), and Jynwel Capital of Hong Kong. "We found long-term investors, who are not just looking at the short-term returns typical of private equity," Wiesenthal said.[19] The New York Times, in a Deals of the Year wrap-up, called it the "sleeper deal of 2011," one that "might have been the most interesting."[20] Billboard described Wiesenthal as a "winner" in the deal: he helped assemble a consortium of investors to buy EMI Music Publishing. As a result of the transaction, Sony now controls the largest collection of publishing copyrights in the world.”[21] Bob Pittman, CEO of Clear Channel Communications said, "He took it from being insignificant to being the biggest."[22]
As Sony entered the tablet market in 2011, Wiesenthal publicly discussed the important role of the marriage of tablets and television can play in the emerging connected television business. He told a Goldman Sachs conference in New York that, although five years previously, "it was all about the boxes; TiVo, Slingbox, Roku, I think the consumers really have box exhaustion." In their place, TVs can evolve so they only have one wire: the power cord. Consumers, in turn, he said, will use tablets to access video content from the Cloud and control the TV screen.[23]
Warner Music Group[edit]
In January 2, 2013, Wiesenthal was hired as Chief Operating Office, Warner Music Group in an effort to bolster the company's M&A, corporate development, and digital initiatives.[3]
In early 2013, Wiesenthal played a key role in the Company's acquisition of Parlophone, one of the world's leading recorded music companies and home to Coldplay, David Guetta, and Pink Floyd.[24]
In September 2013, Wiesenthal led the effort to architect and launch a multi-platform alliance between Warner Music Group and Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio station operator in the United States. The New York Times said the deal, "re-writes the rules on royalties". [25]
Prior to joining Warner Music Group in 2013, Wiesenthal founded Blade, the first crowdsourced short distance aviation company.[26] In June 2014, Wiesenthal said he would leave Time Warner and work full-time in Blade as the latter's leader.[4]
In 2015, Wiesenthal negotiated an alliance on behalf of Warner Music Group with Snapchat to become the very first music company to have a channel on the Discover platform. With the Discover feature, companies could refresh “videos daily [and] create major promotional opportunities that [would] be monetized through sponsorship and advertising,” Wiesenthal stated in an interview with Billboard. Under the Warner Music Group section, Snapchat users could view sneak-peaks of music videos, daily headlines, advertisements, and promotions.[27]
Achievements[edit]
Crain’s New York Business named him on its “40 Under 40” list in 2003.[5]
In 2010, Wiesenthal was an inductee of the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders, along with Sergey Brin of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Peter Thiel of PayPal, and others.[28]
In 2014, he was named to the Billboard Power 100, an annual survey of the most powerful people in the music business as determined by Billboard Magazine.[29]
In October, 2015, the company he co-founded, BLADE, was named one the "100 Hottest Startups in New York City" as determined by Business Insider. [30]
He serves on the Board of Directors of Entercom Communications Corp., the fourth largest radio broadcaster in the U.S., TripAdvisor, Inc. (The 2nd largest East Coast-based Internet company by market capitalization.), global pay-TV network operator Starz as well as Jawbone, a leading connected consumer device company specializing in personal wellness technology and audio products.[31]
He is a mentor of Techstars NYC (www.techstars.com) a mentorship-driven start-up accelerator and seed fund that helps emerging digital companies launch and obtain strategic funding. [32]
Personal life[edit]
Wiesenthal lives in New York City. He had raced Formula Ford cars in the U.S. which led to passion of car collecting and subsequently to creating with a partner the Bridgehampton Motoring Club, the leading Active Storage Collector car facility in the U.S.[33]
During Roger Waters' 2010 U.S. tour "The Wall", Wiesenthal played ukulele with Waters and his band during a set for two dates at Madison Square Garden.[34]
Wiesenthal was previously married to Goldman Sachs managing director Linnea Conrad.[35] They have one son (born 1997).[36]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
