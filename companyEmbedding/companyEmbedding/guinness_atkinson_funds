 Investing in Dividends
The mighty dividend. Very simply, it is the distribution of a portion of corporate profits to its owners. But the dividend isn’t at all simple. It has the ability to grow, and with time and reinvestment, can be very mighty indeed.

The form to initiate the automatic investment plan is contained in the new account application.  If you need help on this please feel free to call our customer service team at 800 915-6566.

A.  Our customer service team is standing by to assist you.  Please give them a call at 800 915-6566.  We are not able to process account changes or transactions via email but our team is more than willing to help you with whatever need you may have.
Q.  What do I do if I need to make a redemption?
A.  Most shareholders have telephone redemption privileges.  A call to our customer service team at 800 915-6566 is the easiest way to initiate a redemption.  If you have not signed up for telephone redemption our customer service team will walk you through the necessary steps to process a redemption.
Q.  Do you offer a money market fund?
A. A money market fund is available for exchange purposes, meaning if you wish to move to a cash investment we have one available. Please call our customer service team at 800 915-6566 for more information or to make an exchange.
Q. Can you tell me about expectations for year-end dividends? I’d like to do some year-end tax planning.
A.  We typically post year-end distribution estimates in October or November and then update these estimates if necessary as the year draws to a close.  Please note that these estimates are subject to change and the final dividend distributions may vary from the estimates.  The final dividend amounts are posted a few days before year-end.  Information on quarterly and year-end dividends is available here.
Q.  Do you offer electronic statements?
A.  At the moment, no.  We are planning to initiate electronic delivery of statements at some point in the future.
Q. Where can I find performance information on the Guinness Atkinson Funds?
A. The Our Funds page has up to date performance including total returns and Morningstar Ratings.
Q.  Are the Guinness Atkinson Funds considered load or no-load?
A.  All of the Guinness Atkinson Funds are no-load, which means there is no commission or charge to purchase the Guinness Atkinson Funds.  This does not mean that there are no management fees or other expenses.  Some brokers may charge a transaction fee for some of the Guinness Atkinson Funds.  Also, there is a short-term redemption fee of 2% for shares held for 30 days or less.
Q.  Why is there a redemption fee?
A.  The Guinness Atkinson Funds are meant for long-term investors. The redemption fee (2% for 30 days) is meant to both discourage active trading in the Guinness Atkinson Funds and to compensate the remaining investors for activity based charges incurred by the Fund.
Q.  What do you mean by human progress? And why is it important to investing?
A.  We believe that it is difficult to invest successfully without a view regarding the direction we are heading, and by “we,” we mean the entire world. There are a handful of very important long-term secular trends underway that are quite clearly reshaping the planet.  These changes have political, social, cultural, economic and, importantly for us, investment implications.  The breakneck speed of business and innovation, the dramatic and stunning rise of China and Asia, the increasing demands for energy on a global scale and the inexorable shift to alternative energy are just some of the forces that are profoundly reshaping the world around us. We’re not sure how—or why—one would invest without thinking about these broad themes and factoring the implications of this change into their thinking.
Further, while we understand that rapid change can be unsettling, the hidden truth in these changes is that the human condition continues to improve. Yes, we know the news media sometimes offers a steady drumbeat of negative news and we acknowledge that there are some very serious issues confronting us.  We also acknowledge that for a large portion of the world life is nothing short of terrible. We’ve always had serious problems to tackle and there has always been a large portion of the world for which life is extreme.  Yet despite the negative drumbeat the human condition continues to improve.  How do we know? Almost any measure of the human condition is on an upward arc.  Infant mortality rates, life expectancy, leisure time, per capita GDP, literacy, access to education, information and health care and a host of other key metrics have never been as high as now.  Quite frankly, there has never been a better time to be a human.
Q.  How do you keep investors up to date?
A.  In addition to this website we offer an email program featuring a series of monthly eBriefs produced by our asset management team.  We offer the following eBriefs: Energy Brief, Asia Brief, Alternative Energy Brief and the Dividend Brief.  These eBriefs are designed to provide our most current thinking about the broad themes as well as the current outlook and update on the holdings within the Funds.  We maintain an archive of these eBriefs so that readers can see what we were thinking in the past.  Whether you’re an investor in our Funds or just interested in our views on these themes you’re encouraged to sign up to receive the eBriefs of your choice.  We also offer a daily or weekly (Friday) email with the day’s prices.
Q.  If I sign up for these eBriefs will you start sending me a bunch of email?
A.  No.  Each eBrief subscription will mean approximately one email per month.  We generally send one or two additional emails per year.  And, of course, we don’t share our email list with anyone.
Q.  What if I have a question that isn’t covered here?
A.  Feel free to send an email to [email protected] We like hearing from investors and welcome the opportunity to address any inquiries.
Q.  I see you have an alternative energy fund.  Who do I speak with if I have an alternative energy project that needs funding?
A.  The Guinness Atkinson Funds invest in publicly traded companies.  We are not in a position to provide funding for projects, startups or other non-publicly traded investment vehicles. If your company is a publicly traded alternative energy company then it is almost certainly already known to our investment management team.  If it is a project or venture capital idea then we are not able to consider it.

Dividends 
 
The only thing we like better than dividends is growing dividends. The fact that dividends have the ability to grow over time is an important benefit to investors seeking to keep pace with inflation and can be a key to enhancing the quality of life.  Our dividend strategy explicitly seeks a rising dividend stream over time.

Dividends are a key component to long term total returns. From 1940 to 2010 90% of the total return of the S&P 500 was from dividends. One of the benefits of dividends is that they have the ability to grow over time which can help offset the effects of inflation and low or rising interest rate environment. And who doesn’t appreciate a growing income stream?
Because we’re explicitly aiming for dividend growth, we focus on high quality companies. The idea of investing in high quality companies sounds nice (who doesn’t want high quality companies in their portfolio?), but it isn’t just a vague concept or slogan. We have developed an investment methodology that rigorously, even ruthlessly, identifies high quality companies. To us, high quality means companies that have demonstrated a long-term consistent ability to generate high levels of cash flow. It is this demonstrated ability to generate relatively high levels of cash that allows companies to grow their dividend over time. And, as we’ve said, the only thing we like better than dividends are growing dividends.

Most mutual fund managers are unable to beat stock indices, so when a management team does so for many years, we want to know about it. Before we dig into the Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators Fund, let’s recall Mark Hulbert’s discussion about how awful active managers’ track records have been when measured against the S&P 500 Index 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    SPX, -0.13%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         “Over the last 15 years, 92.2% of large-cap funds lagged a simple S&P 500 fund,” MarketWatch’s Hulbert said. As its name implies, the Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators Fund 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    IWIRX, -0.31%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         aims for growth by investing in companies with competitive edges that translate into high returns on capital. “We think innovation can be applied across industries,” co-manager Matthew Page said in an interview May 5. “You have disruptive companies, but also companies that sustain themselves through innovation, and also continuous innovators.” He has been managing the fund with Ian Mortimer since 2010, and worked as the fund’s analyst before that, starting in 2005.  The fund’s benchmark is the MSCI World Index. But Morningstar, which ranks the fund four of five stars, measures its performance against the S&P 500. Here’s how it has performed against both indices:       Total return - 2017 through May 9   Average return - 3 years   Average return - 5 years   Average return - 10 years   Average return - 15 years    Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators Fund - Investor Shares 14.0% 9.8% 16.7% 8.6% 9.8%   MSCI World Index 8.9% 6.0% 11.0% 3.8% 6.7%   S&P 500 Index 7.8% 10.8% 14.5% 7.0% 7.7%   Source: Morningstar    The fund’s average performance has outperformed both by significant margins for three, five, 10 and 15 years, putting it in exclusive company. Page said the fund is about 5% overweight U.S. stocks, relative to the MSCI World Index. Here’s the fund’s geographic breakdown as of March 31:










Page said that for the managers of the fund, “innovation” can mean a new product or service, “technical or scientific ... a new chip or drug.” But he also looks for innovative or disruptive business models, “the likes of Netflix 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    NFLX, +0.74%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         or Uber.” Then the fund managers dig into a company’s numbers to see if they point to strong long-term financial performance. A hot new technological service or product may not mean there is a solid investment to be had. He said 3D printing is an example, saying he expects continual rapid growth for the industry.  Still, “the companies that were available to invest in, in that area, were not high quality,” he said.

Recent purchase decisions have leaned toward Asia, but Page stressed: “We are very much bottom-up stock pickers,” meaning the managers are more focused on individual companies’ attributes, not geographic regions. “So this is not a broad view of Asia, but a lot of what makes Asia cheap is the valuations of banks and financial companies, which make up a lot of the benchmark,” he said. “So it was a combination of Asia stocks looking cheap and these companies’ valuations giving us good starting points. We have subsequently seen a re-rating. I would not necessarily bang on the table to buy more at this point in time, but I am sort of happy with what we’ve got at the moment.”  He was referring to Catcher Technology Co. Ltd.

With shares of Apple returning 29% this year through May 5, while Catcher is up 39% and AAC is up 52%, he said he would “actually be trimming them back at these levels” if there were new money to invest.  But it’s important to keep in mind how often concerns over Apple, as expressed in breathless media headlines, have pushed down its stock and shares of its suppliers. There may be another period of attractive entry points for these stocks. Catcher makes unibody aluminum cases for Apple’s  MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Page said that in this niche, the company has “sufficient scale that no other competitor can [really] compete with them. The key is aluminum technology and using robots to mill out single-piece casings.” Page added that Catcher “buys robots from Fanuc Corp.

It is one of the leading robotics companies in the world.” AAC Technologies represents “another bit of the Apple supply chain,” Page said. The company makes acoustic components, including headphones and also haptic components, which provide vibration feedback to the user, and taptic components, which are touch-sensitive. A big concern for Apple is increasing competition from lower-cost Asian smartphone manufacturers, but Page said these companies would also be well-positioned to supply them. Still worthy of buying When asked to name a company whose stock is still valued low enough that he would consider building the fund’s position, Page mentioned Infineon Technologies AG

The company has “a very significant edge on their competitors, with some momentum with their earnings results.” The company makes automotive semiconductor components, and with the development of adaptive cruise control, entertainment systems and automation, “there is more and more silicon going into these cars,” Page said. “If you look forward, electric vehicles are likely to become a more significant portion of the market,” he said. “You have Tesla Inc.

Fully one-third of the world lives in Asia, and close to a billion Asians have risen from poverty to middle class status, making them a consumer market as well as a manufacturing hub for the developed world. Rapid industrialization and economic reform have helped China become the world’s second largest economy, surpassing Japan now in third place and India in fourth place. We think that Asia’s remarkable economic growth has been and will continue to be an engine for the global economy over the next 50 years. Our Asia Focus Fund lets you participate in this unprecedented growth by investing in dynamic companies located in China, Hong Kong, India, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and more.

“It may sound like a cliché to refer to the “Asian Miracle” but I believe that the economic growth that has occurred in Asia throughout the last 30 years represents the greatest increase in the human condition for more people than any other event in human history.“




Edmund Harriss
Investment Director, Fund Manager















Having managed the Asia Funds for over 14 years both from London and from Hong Kong, Edmund Harriss is dedicated to understanding the agents of change. It’s about making ourselves ready for the new world that is unfolding in front of our eyes. For Edmund there is nothing quite like studying companies and making the right investment call. He welcomes the sense of responsibility to all the people invested in his funds. He embraces that trust that has been placed in him, relishes the challenge, and enjoys nothing more than to deliver on those hopes.
In the process of translating grand transformational themes into a stock portfolio, Edmund seeks to understand businesses and to forecast a range of outcomes before making a final investment decision.
Trend not to be overlooked: Demographic change. The populations of the developed world are getting older while the developing economies are now the source of new workers. This trend presages a major shift in the balance of economic power in the world.



Edmund's Funds:

Joined Guinness Atkinson Asset Management in 2003 and also serves as investment director and board member.

To the extent that the Advisor absorbs expenses to satisfy this cap, it may recoup a portion or all of such amounts absorbed at any time within three fiscal years after the fiscal year in which such amounts were absorbed, subject to the expense cap in place at the time recoupment is sought, which cannot exceed the expense cap at the time of the waiver.

“I can’t help thinking that we are lucky to live in the 21st century.“




Jim Atkinson
Chief Executive Officer















As you might deduce from the above quote, Jim is one of those annoyingly optimistic fellows who can’t wait to get out of the bed in the morning. He can often be heard saying things like, “Living standards have increased to the point that even the poorest in the industrialized world today have more than the King of England in 1500.” This is just one of the fun ‘Jim facts’ that fill our days. And while he never tires of gushing about this being his “dream job,” we should mention that, according to Jim, if he couldn’t do this he’d be a tugboat operator. He does not elaborate on that point.
Having spent more than 30 years in the world of finance and management, Jim exhibits a level of passion and motivation that we can only describe as “Jim Atkinson-like.” His level of expertise is rivaled only by his drive to expand his understanding of the global community. We estimate that he will tire of this as soon as he knows everything there is to know in the universe.
As a Founder of Guinness Atkinson Funds, Jim has been instrumental in developing the company’s philosophy and in identifying the core fund themes of human progress and profound change. For Jim, there’s never been a better time to be a human being, and this attitude shines through in everything he does. Even very early in the morning, before we’ve had caffeine.
Trend not to be overlooked: We can’t afford to miss the potential dominance of Asia and China.

“Progress is exciting— it’s an opportunity to meet new and complex challenges. And every Guinness Atkinson Fund presents an opportunity to invest in progress.“




Tim Guinness
Chief Investment Officer, Fund Manager















As a Founder and the Chief Investment Officer of Guinness Atkinson Funds, Tim Guinness is a logic-based value investor with nearly 40 years of experience. He believes in hard work and discipline, subjecting stocks to a gauntlet of due diligence. His investment strategy, a draw not only for investors but also for those joining his team, involves a combination of crunching the numbers into a fine powder, constantly reviewing sectors and sub-sectors for profitability and growth potential, and staying sharply focused on the themes of global transformation and profound change.
Tim’s investment strategy also involves riding his bicycle to work in the morning – demonstrating a passion for life that equals his love for numbers. In fact, he founded the company on the basic principal that investment opportunities could be enhanced by focusing on specific global themes that are changing our lives today and will continue to do so long into the future. Tim and co-founder Jim Atkinson have an ongoing contest to see who can generate the most enthusiasm. Soon they will have to take out warehouse space to store it all.
Trend not to be overlooked: Energy demand growth in the developing world, which will likely be met by both traditional sources, like oil and gas, and renewable sources, like wind and solar.

“It may sound like a cliché to refer to the “Asian Miracle” but I believe that the economic growth that has occurred in Asia throughout the last 30 years represents the greatest increase in the human condition for more people than any other event in human history.“




Edmund Harriss
Investment Director, Fund Manager















Having managed the Asia Funds for over 14 years both from London and from Hong Kong, Edmund Harriss is dedicated to understanding the agents of change. It’s about making ourselves ready for the new world that is unfolding in front of our eyes. For Edmund there is nothing quite like studying companies and making the right investment call. He welcomes the sense of responsibility to all the people invested in his funds. He embraces that trust that has been placed in him, relishes the challenge, and enjoys nothing more than to deliver on those hopes.
In the process of translating grand transformational themes into a stock portfolio, Edmund seeks to understand businesses and to forecast a range of outcomes before making a final investment decision.
Trend not to be overlooked: Demographic change. The populations of the developed world are getting older while the developing economies are now the source of new workers. This trend presages a major shift in the balance of economic power in the world.

“I can see the potential for 10 to 20 years of strong growth across the renewable energy industry. Energy supply may be the most pressing issue facing the planet today.“




Edward Guinness
Fund Manager















It’s important to Edward Guinness to be part of a company that sets itself apart by thinking creatively. Edward manages our Alternative Energy Fund, which provides one of the best opportunities for the company to leverage its creative mindset.
Increase in global energy supply is essential for continued improvements to living standards throughout the world.  And with the prospect of electric vehicles, we expect electricity consumption in 20 years to be considerably higher than forecast today by the International Energy Agency, as historic demand forecasts have usually proved to be conservative.
Edward watches market trends unblinkingly, paying particular attention to new developments, resource shifts and innovations relating to alternative as well as mainstream energy. His experience and insight in identifying trends and his ability to combine forward thinking with traditional values such as hard work and discipline make him a good match for this fund.
Trend not to be overlooked: Growth in global electricity demand.

Dr. Ian Mortimer, CFA
Fund Co-Manager















Massive, overwhelming quantities of data are a welcome sight to Dr. Ian Mortimer. With a background in physics and the skills he picked up while getting his doctorate—such as logical thinking, math, and data analysis—he is able to recognize patterns and meaning where others may see only chaos and noise.  Ian uses these skills on a daily basis at Guinness Atkinson.
His passion for his investment areas (Energy, Innovation, Dividends) helps keep him in tune with what’s happening throughout the world in all areas impacting global progress. He pays strict attention to stock price fluctuations and their constant movement as he analyzes the market. Yet for as much as he looks at the numbers when researching a potential investment opportunity, he also relies on personal interactions, analyzing a company’s passion, commitment, and potential success through the attitudes and actions of their corporate management.
Trend not to be overlooked: Companies’ ability to consistently innovate, with technologies, distribution chains or process efficiencies.

“Global energy concerns are going to be absolutely central to political and social decisions that are made over the next decade.“




Will Riley
Fund Co-Lead Manager















Will Riley has a mind for finance and a passion for global energy. With over twelve years in finance and eight years of valuation analysis, his goal is to find the most attractive investments across the global energy spectrum.
While mainstream energy is clearly an issue of central importance today, Will believes that interest in the sector will increase markedly as the combination of growing demand and dwindling supply signals a continued rise in energy prices. His simple enjoyment of analysis and his enthusiasm for the market continually drive him to find lucrative opportunities. And while he can spend hours pouring over spreadsheets and analyzing data, he also thrives on the spirited debates of the Guinness Atkinson team—a cornerstone of our investment process.
Trend not to be overlooked: The breadth of growth in oil demand across the developing world, not just from China.

Performance data shown for Global Innovators, Institutional Class (GINNX), prior to its launch date on 12/31/15, uses performance data from the Global Innovators, Investor Class (IWIRX).  
Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the Funds may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Total returns reflect a fee waiver in effect and in the absence of this waiver, the total returns which reflect fee waivers would be lower. Performance data does not reflect the 2% redemption fee for shares held less than 30 days and if deducted the fee would reduce the performance quoted.
* The Advisor has contractually agreed to waive fees through June 30, 2018.

Global Innovators Fund ratings shown were given for the Investor Share Class.
Morningstar RatingTM
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Innovation 
 
In today’s hypercompetitive  environment and ever-changing business cycles, we think innovation is a prerequisite for success. Innovation is not just an idea; it is a way of doing business. We think companies that consistently innovate are more likely to be market leaders and that they have the potential to produce superior returns.

Why Innovation? 

The implications of technology, globalism, and communications have forever changed the world of business. While the fit may survive, it’s the innovative that thrive. Companies must relentlessly question all assumptions related to their business operations.
Innovation is often associated with technology, but it’s much more than the latest software or electronic gadget. Business innovations can be found in better ways of doing almost anything: product development, supply chain management, marketing and sales, process efficiency or a host of other competitive advantages. Innovation helps companies overcome the forces of competition and attain longevity, even during times of inflation.
We believe innovation is the theme that will dominate the western world in our current century as it continues to take hold in the developing world. At Guinness Atkinson Funds, we’re optimistic about opportunities available in companies that create value through original thinking, imagination and thinking one step ahead of the rest of the world and we aim to do the same








Innovation Matters

Explore in this whitepaper what is Innovation, its role in successful companies and how Guinness Atkinson identifies Innovators for the Global Innovators Fund.

Overview
Performance
Holdings & Details
Managers


China’s per capita gross domestic product grew nearly 13 times between 1980 and 2010 according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service. It took the United States nearly 150 years to match that progress. Mass industrialization has created new markets for consumer and industrial goods and services, accelerating China’s economic growth. On the doorstep of this vast superpower sits Hong Kong, a world-class financial, marketing and technical center. We think China’s rise and the Hong Kong marketplace will have profound implications for our global future. Now you can participate in China’s transformation to an industrialized, consumer society, as well as Hong Kong’s continued growth as China’s most sophisticated commercial center. Our China and Hong Kong Fund invests in stocks of companies that are traded on the China or Hong Kong exchanges or that do at least half of their business in China and/or Hong Kong.

Edmund Harriss
Investment Director, Fund Manager















Having managed the Asia Funds for over 14 years both from London and from Hong Kong, Edmund Harriss is dedicated to understanding the agents of change. It’s about making ourselves ready for the new world that is unfolding in front of our eyes. For Edmund there is nothing quite like studying companies and making the right investment call. He welcomes the sense of responsibility to all the people invested in his funds. He embraces that trust that has been placed in him, relishes the challenge, and enjoys nothing more than to deliver on those hopes.
In the process of translating grand transformational themes into a stock portfolio, Edmund seeks to understand businesses and to forecast a range of outcomes before making a final investment decision.
Trend not to be overlooked: Demographic change. The populations of the developed world are getting older while the developing economies are now the source of new workers. This trend presages a major shift in the balance of economic power in the world.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Fund risk factors
All the Guinness Funds are open ended, long-only equity funds. Investors should be willing and able to assume the risks of equity investing. Investment in the Funds carries with it a degree of risk and investors should read the risk factors section in the prospectus before investing. The value of the Funds’ portfolios changes daily in accordance with the movement of underlying capital markets and the specific share price movements of the companies in whose shares each Fund invests.
Past performance is not a guide to future performance.
Performance risks
We identify the following performance risks in our Funds:



 

Market risk
The value of investments and the income from them may go down as well as up and are not guaranteed. An investor may not get back the amount originally invested. The value of an investment can be affected by changes in general market conditions, other political, social and economic developments, as well as specific matters relating to the companies in whose securities each Fund invests.


Currency risk
 Changes in the rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down.
While the Funds have share classes priced in various currencies, the base currency of all the Funds is US Dollars, and the Fund valuations for all share classes are initially calculated each dealing day in US Dollars. Non-US Dollar share classes are then converted into their respective currencies from the US Dollar valuation.
The Funds invest internationally and hold all investments in local currency. Guinness Asset Management does not conduct any hedging of currency exposure on the Funds’ capital value or income. The Funds aim to be fully invested most of the time, but any cash balances are normally held in US dollars. This means that the exposure of the Funds to any one currency is mainly limited to the value of its holdings in stocks priced in that currency. Therefore, as well as the impact of share price movements in the securities each Fund holds, the capital value of an investment in a Fund will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the stocks’ local currency, the Fund’s base currency (USD) and the currency of the Fund share class you own.


Emerging market risk
The risk inherent in a Fund is higher when it is invested in markets which may be considered ’emerging’. These Funds are only suitable for those investors who are prepared to accept the above average volatility inherent in emerging market investment.




There are other risks of investing in our funds, such as credit and counterparty risks, which are detailed in the Prospectus.
Shareholders in Guinness Global Equity Income Fund and Guinness Global Money Managers Fund should note that all or part of the fees and expenses can be charged to the capital of the Funds. Charging fees and expenses to capital has the effect of lowering the capital value of your investment.
Fund specific risks
In addition some funds carry their own specific risks:






Sector risk
Some funds invest only in companies involved in a single industry or a single sector of the market. These funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one industry or sector, and can be volatile. Examples in the Guinness fund range include:

Guinness Alternative Energy Fund
Guinness Global Energy Fund
Guinness Global Money Managers Fund




Geographic risk
Some funds invest only in stocks listed in or exposed to one single country or region. These funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one country or region, and can be volatile. Examples in the Guinness fund range include:

Guinness China & Hong Kong Fund





For more detail on the risks relating to specific products, please refer to the relevant documentation for that product.
Guinness EIS Service
An Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) is a government initiative to encourage investment in smaller, higher-risk companies by offering a range of tax reliefs to investors. EIS-qualifying companies can be unlisted smaller companies (companies whose shares are not quoted on any recognised stock exchange), or companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).
The Guinness EIS Service is a discretionary managed service investing in EIS qualifying companies and managed by Guinness Asset Management Ltd, the Investment Manager. The Service comprises a range of investment themes which can be accessed by investors via a sequence of dated “offerings”. Each offering has a finite subscription period, with an opening and closing date for subscriptions. To qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an EIS investment, investors should be prepared to hold their investment for a minimum of three years. Each offering has its own Information Memorandum detailing the terms and conditions, specific risks and tax implications of investment.
The range of investment themes in the Guinness EIS Service include AIM-listed companies and Sustainable Energy companies.
An investment in the Guinness EIS Service is subject to a number of risks, both general and specific to each offering within the Service. Before making any decision to invest, prospective investors need to understand that investing in EIS-qualifying companies can be highly speculative and carries high risk. The Information Memorandum for each offering contains details of the risks involved. Investors should consider carefully whether a subscription is suitable for them in the light of the information in the Information Memorandum and their personal circumstances. Before investing, investors are strongly recommended to consult an authorised financial adviser. We recommend you seek appropriate independent advice before investing.
Past performance of the Investment Manager is no guarantee of future performance. The value of an investment in any investee company may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested. The Investment Manager will rely on achieving an exit for the investments made in each offering in order to generate a capital gain for investors. There is no guarantee that exits will be available at the prices anticipated by the Investment Manager.
General EIS investment risks
1. Concentration risk
The Investment Manager may be unable to make sufficient investments in suitable investee companies. If sufficient investments are not made, the returns achieved by the Service could be materially impacted.
The Investment Manager intends to invest across a portfolio of investee companies to diversify exposure to any one company. However, there is a risk that the investments are concentrated or there is a weighting towards one or more sectors. In these circumstances returns to investors may be adversely affected by the underperformance of a particular company or sector.
2. Size and liquidity risk
The Guinness EIS Service invests in companies that are relatively small. Smaller investee companies can be vulnerable to government actions and changes in statute. In particular, there may be changes to the EIS legislation which may affect investors’ tax positions.
Investee companies may be reliant on the skills or knowledge of a small number of individuals, and should a key individual leave performance may be adversely affected.
Some companies’ shares in which the Investment Manager invests will be listed on AIM, other companies will be unlisted.
Listed shares
Although some companies’ shares in which the Guinness EIS Service can invest are listed on AIM, not all shares are readily realisable at all times.
Investment in shares traded on AIM involves a higher degree of risk, and such shares may be less liquid, than shares in companies which are listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. The rules governing AIM companies are less demanding than those of companies listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange.
The market price of AIM-listed shares may not necessarily reflect their underlying value.
The share price of AIM-listed companies can be highly volatile and shareholdings can be illiquid. The price at which AIM-listed shares are quoted and the price at which such shares may realise will be influenced by a large number of factors, some specific to the relevant investee company and its operations, and others which may affect AIM-listed companies generally, such as legislative changes, and general economic, political, regulatory or social conditions.
Some AIM-listed companies are majority owned by connected parties who may be in a position to exert influence on the relevant investee company and their interests may differ from other shareholders.
Unlisted shares
Some offerings in the Guinness EIS Service can invest in companies which are not expected to have a listing or quotation. Therefore, there may not be a recognised or active market for the shares of investee companies and it may be difficult to sell or realise the investment or obtain reliable information about their value. Investors should not consider investing money in an offering which can hold shares in unlisted companies if their investment may be required during the life of the offering, which is normally at least three years.
Investors should not consider subscribing unless they can afford a total loss of their subscription.
Minority holdings in unquoted investments may be difficult to protect and difficult to realise. The timing of realisations of investments by the Service cannot therefore be predicted.
3. Tax risks
The tax reliefs referred to in the Information Memorandum for each offering in the Guinness EIS Service are those currently applicable. However, investors should be aware that tax reliefs can change. Their applicability and value will depend upon the individual circumstances of a given investor, and investors should seek their own independent professional advice on their particular tax situation and the application of such tax reliefs prior to making a subscription in the Service.
It is the intention of the Investment Manager to invest in companies which qualify under the EIS legislation, but there is no guarantee that EIS status can be maintained throughout the life of the Investment. Both investee companies and investors need to comply with the requirements of the EIS legislation in order to maintain EIS Income Tax Relief, CGT free disposal and CGT Deferral Relief, and non-compliance may result in the loss or partial claw-back of EIS Income Tax Relief and CGT Deferral Relief, and potential interest penalties. Subscription funds will not be returned in these instances; investments will be exited as deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager.
Shares in companies which qualify under the EIS legislation will normally qualify for Business Property Relief for Inheritance Tax purposes. In order to secure this relief investors must retain their shareholding in an investee company for a minimum of two years. The Investment Manager intends to invest in companies which qualify for EIS Relief, CGT Deferral Relief and Business Property Relief, although there is a possibility that investments will not qualify for one or more of these.
To qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an EIS investment, it is the intention of the Investment Manager that investments in qualifying companies will be held for three years. However, the Investment Manager reserves the right to realise individual investments before three years if it believes it is in the best interests of investors.
Specific EIS risks
Additional risks and uncertainties apply to each offering in the Service and the companies in which it invests. These specific risks may have an adverse effect on the business of the investee companies. Investors should consider carefully whether a subscription to the Service is suitable for them in the light of the information in the relevant Information Memorandum, and their personal circumstances.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of companies that are either primarily traded on the China or Hong Kong exchanges or that derive at least 50% of their revenues from business activities in China and/or Hong Kong, but which may be listed and traded elsewhere. It invests at least 65% of its total assets in companies included in the Hang Seng Composite Index. The Advisor will invest the fund's assets in securities of all market capitalization companies, including companies in emerging markets. The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. These risks are particularly significant for funds that focus on a single country or region. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 714 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks a moderate level of current income and consistent dividend growth at a rate that exceeds inflation.




Strategy



The fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities in dividend-paying companies that the Advisor believes have the ability to consistently increase their dividend payments over the medium term. The adviser will consider all companies in the world's developed and emerging markets. The Advisor will invest the fund's assets in securities of all market capitalization companies.


Risk



Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
11. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 6/30/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.

Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.
