LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26, 2014 /PRNewswire/ - MeeMee Media Inc. (the "Company" or
 "MeeMee") (OTCQB: MEME), a development stage company focused on the
 global mobile and digital media business, announces that Paul Amsellem
 is replacing Ira Rubenstein as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
 Mr. Amsellem is also joining MeeMee's Board of Directors. Mr.
 Rubenstein will continue to serve as a Director of MeeMee and play a
 key role in guiding the Company's business and M&A strategy going
 forward.


Mr. Rubenstein commented:


"I leave the role of MeeMee's CEO with mixed feelings.  On the one hand,
 I am taking what I believe is an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with a
 major media company - one of the few media jobs in the world that could
 entice me to leave the CEO's position at MeeMee.  On the other hand, I
 know the Company's strategy and forward progress remains intact under
 the leadership of Executive Chairman Martin Doane and new CEO Paul
 Amsellem. Further, I remain committed to working with MeeMee in a board
 capacity to deliver innovative strategy guidance and content and
 corporate acquisition opportunities."


Paul Amsellem comes to the role of MeeMee CEO with an extensive record
 of success, spanning more than twenty years in the mobile, digital
 media, technology, marketing and advertising spheres. Mr. Amsellem
 began his career at Wunderman (a WPP company) where he oversaw the data
 analytics group.  He then founded, ran and sold two pioneering European
 mobile media companies: PhoneValley and Cellcast Interactif. 
 Subsequently, Mr. Amsellem served as the CEO of Adenyo Europe and then
 as the COO of Nokia (France).  These roles afforded Mr. Amsellem the
 privilege of working at the highest levels with many of the largest
 carriers, media companies, brands and advertising agencies in the
 world.  Most recently, Mr. Amsellem has led Nemapp, an exclusive
 European mobile and digital media consulting firm specializing in
 investment, marketing and strategy.  During his tenure there he has
 worked with many substantial public and private sector clients.


Mr. Amsellem commented on his new position with MeeMee:


"I am incredibly excited about this opportunity and look forward to
 helping MeeMee complete its pending acquisition of the Latin American
 mobile content company and then executing the Company's international
 expansion strategy.  I believe MeeMee's business and capital markets
 strategy is perfectly suited to the current mobile environment, and
 that we can build an unique, publicly-traded mobile player with
 sufficient scale to compete and win on a global basis."


About MeeMee Media Inc.: Headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, MeeMee intends to use the Latin
 American mobile platform as a launch pad for building a global-scale
 digital entertainment, advertising and marketing enterprise. MeeMee's
 development strategy combines organic growth initiatives with targeted
 acquisitions in strategic markets and industry verticals around the
 world.
