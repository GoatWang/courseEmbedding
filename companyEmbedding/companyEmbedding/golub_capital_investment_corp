History[edit]
1994–2000: Foundation and early success[edit]
Golub Capital was founded in New York City in 1994 by Lawrence Golub. Golub had previously worked at Allen & Company, Wasserstein Perella & Co., and Bankers Trust. He had also been a White House Fellow.[12] The firm initially operated with $20 million of equity capital under management.[13][12] Anchor investors in Golub Capital's first fund included Dan Lufkin (of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette), Stanley S. Shuman (of Allen & Company), and Mellon Bank among others.[14] Golub and an assistant were the only employees at Golub Capital's outset, but, by 2000, the firm had between 8 and 10 employees and a fund worth a couple hundred million dollars.[13][15]
2000–2004: Shift in focus[edit]
In 2000, the firm began specializing in mezzanine loans. These loans were geared toward private equity-backed companies. Golub Capital no longer made investments in controlled private equity investments in order not to compete with their private equity clients. In the aftermath of the dot-com bust in 2000, the firm achieved success with its mezzanine loans as most cash flow loans became unavailable.[13][12]
In 2003, David Golub (Lawrence's brother)[12] joined the firm as its President (with Lawrence Golub remaining CEO). Golub had previously been Managing Director of both Centre Partners Management LLC and Corporate Partners.[16] Also in 2004, Andrew Steuerman (previously of Albion Alliance and the New York Life Insurance Company) joined Golub Capital. Steuerman became the head of originations[12] and eventually gained the titles of Senior Managing Director and Head of Middle Market and Late Stage Lending.[2]
2004–2008: Further business expansion[edit]
In 2004, Golub Capital began offering senior and one-stop loans. By 2007, the firm was a lead lender and arranger in senior loans.[13] In 2005, on the final closing of its fourth GCP fund (Golub Capital Partners IV), the firm raised $800 million of equity capital. Its fifth GCP fund (Golub Capital Partners V) raised $700 million of equity capital. Golub Capital's total capital under management increased to $2.5 billion as a result.[17][18]
2008–present: Financial crisis and beyond[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis, Golub Capital was one of the few lending firms that continued to grow.[13][12] By the end of 2008, the firm was third by deal volume for lead arrangers of sub-$100 million leveraged buyout loans and had raised $1.5 billion for new loans.[10][12] In 2009, it became the number one bookrunner for leveraged buyout loans in the middle market. By 2010, the firm had $4 billion capital under management.[9]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc. was founded in 2009 and went public in March 2010. It trades on the NASDAQ under stock ticker symbol, GBDC.[15][8] David Golub serves as the CEO and President of Golub Capital BDC.[16]
In 2011, the firm had 120 employees with offices in New York, Chicago, and Atlanta.[12] Their loan portfolio also increased to $5 billion.[19] In 2012, the firm led a targeted campaign to serve lower middle market companies that have an annual EBITDA of between $6 and $8 million.[20]
In 2014, the firm's capital under management increased to $10 billion with the final closings of the Golub Capital Partners VIII fund and the Golub Capital Partners International VIII.[14] That year, the firm closed a mix of deals, including boot retailer Boot Barn with a $100 million facility[21] and fiber optic infrastructure company Wilcon Holdings with a $59 million facility.[22] The firm opened a lending office in San Francisco in 2014 to handle its late stage lending business line.[6] As of 2016, the firm has over $20 billion in capital under management.[1][3]
Businesses[edit]
Golub Capital has three main business lines: middle market lending, late stage lending, and broadly syndicated loans.[4] The firm typically invests in sectors like SaaS, health care, restaurants, business services, and many others.[19][2] The firm is also affiliated with Golub Capital BDC, Inc., a publicly traded (NASDAQ: GDBC) business development company.[15]
Middle Market Lending[edit]
Andrew Steuerman heads Golub Capital’s Middle Market Lending team located in Chicago and New York. The business line focuses on providing senior, one-stop, and second lien debt to U.S. middle market companies, typically controlled by private equity firms.[14][12] Golub Capital can hold over $400 million in each middle market lending deal,[23] and the team can also underwrite and syndicate senior credit facilities and a proprietary suite of one-loan debt facilities of up to $750 million.[24] The typical borrower generates between $5 million to $50 million a year in EBITDA and is backed by one of over 200 private equity companies with which Golub Capital has a working relationship.[20] Approximately 85% of financings done with private equity companies come from pre-existing relationships.[14]
Late Stage Lending[edit]
The firm's late stage lending unit is also headed by Andrew Steuerman.[2] The team operates out of the firm's San Francisco office in order to be closer to Silicon Valley.[4] The business offers debt to fast-growing technology companies backed by venture capital, growth equity, private equity, or other private companies.[4][6]
Broadly Syndicated Loans[edit]
Golub Capital's Broadly Syndicated Loans group is headed by Christina Jamieson in the firm's Chicago office.[9][14] This unit focuses on investing in larger loans that are generally liquid in the secondary market. The Broadly Syndicated Loans team also manages a series of collateralized loan obligations.[25]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc.[edit]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc., (a business development company) was founded in 2009 and went public in March 2010 NASDAQ: GBDC.[15] David Golub serves as the President and CEO of the company.[16] The company lends money to middle market companies that have backing from private equity firms.[26]
Recognition and awards[edit]
Golub Capital has received substantial industry recognition since 2009. In 2016, it was awarded "Lender of the Year, Americas," "Senior Lender of the Year, Americas," and "Business Development Company of the Year" by Private Debt Investor.[27] In 2015, Private Debt Investor named Golub Capital "Lender of the Year" and "Unitranche Lender of the Year."[11] Also in 2015, Golub Capital BDC, Inc. was named "Best Business Development Company" by Creditflux.[28][29] In 2014, the firm was recognized by Private Debt Investor as the 10th largest private debt fund manager.[30] In 2012, Golub Capital was named the "Lender Firm of the Year" by both M&A Advisor and ACG New York.[31] Buyouts Magazine named Golub Capital the "Middle Market Lender of the Year" in 2009 and 2010.[9][13] Golub Capital has received numerous awards from Mergers & Acquisitions including "2008 Lender of the Year,"[32] "Debt Financing Agent of the Year" in 2010,[13] and Lender of the Year in 2017.[23]

History[edit]
1994–2000: Foundation and early success[edit]
Golub Capital was founded in New York City in 1994 by Lawrence Golub. Golub had previously worked at Allen & Company, Wasserstein Perella & Co., and Bankers Trust. He had also been a White House Fellow.[12] The firm initially operated with $20 million of equity capital under management.[13][12] Anchor investors in Golub Capital's first fund included Dan Lufkin (of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette), Stanley S. Shuman (of Allen & Company), and Mellon Bank among others.[14] Golub and an assistant were the only employees at Golub Capital's outset, but, by 2000, the firm had between 8 and 10 employees and a fund worth a couple hundred million dollars.[13][15]
2000–2004: Shift in focus[edit]
In 2000, the firm began specializing in mezzanine loans. These loans were geared toward private equity-backed companies. Golub Capital no longer made investments in controlled private equity investments in order not to compete with their private equity clients. In the aftermath of the dot-com bust in 2000, the firm achieved success with its mezzanine loans as most cash flow loans became unavailable.[13][12]
In 2003, David Golub (Lawrence's brother)[12] joined the firm as its President (with Lawrence Golub remaining CEO). Golub had previously been Managing Director of both Centre Partners Management LLC and Corporate Partners.[16] Also in 2004, Andrew Steuerman (previously of Albion Alliance and the New York Life Insurance Company) joined Golub Capital. Steuerman became the head of originations[12] and eventually gained the titles of Senior Managing Director and Head of Middle Market and Late Stage Lending.[2]
2004–2008: Further business expansion[edit]
In 2004, Golub Capital began offering senior and one-stop loans. By 2007, the firm was a lead lender and arranger in senior loans.[13] In 2005, on the final closing of its fourth GCP fund (Golub Capital Partners IV), the firm raised $800 million of equity capital. Its fifth GCP fund (Golub Capital Partners V) raised $700 million of equity capital. Golub Capital's total capital under management increased to $2.5 billion as a result.[17][18]
2008–present: Financial crisis and beyond[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis, Golub Capital was one of the few lending firms that continued to grow.[13][12] By the end of 2008, the firm was third by deal volume for lead arrangers of sub-$100 million leveraged buyout loans and had raised $1.5 billion for new loans.[10][12] In 2009, it became the number one bookrunner for leveraged buyout loans in the middle market. By 2010, the firm had $4 billion capital under management.[9]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc. was founded in 2009 and went public in March 2010. It trades on the NASDAQ under stock ticker symbol, GBDC.[15][8] David Golub serves as the CEO and President of Golub Capital BDC.[16]
In 2011, the firm had 120 employees with offices in New York, Chicago, and Atlanta.[12] Their loan portfolio also increased to $5 billion.[19] In 2012, the firm led a targeted campaign to serve lower middle market companies that have an annual EBITDA of between $6 and $8 million.[20]
In 2014, the firm's capital under management increased to $10 billion with the final closings of the Golub Capital Partners VIII fund and the Golub Capital Partners International VIII.[14] That year, the firm closed a mix of deals, including boot retailer Boot Barn with a $100 million facility[21] and fiber optic infrastructure company Wilcon Holdings with a $59 million facility.[22] The firm opened a lending office in San Francisco in 2014 to handle its late stage lending business line.[6] As of 2016, the firm has over $20 billion in capital under management.[1][3]
Businesses[edit]
Golub Capital has three main business lines: middle market lending, late stage lending, and broadly syndicated loans.[4] The firm typically invests in sectors like SaaS, health care, restaurants, business services, and many others.[19][2] The firm is also affiliated with Golub Capital BDC, Inc., a publicly traded (NASDAQ: GDBC) business development company.[15]
Middle Market Lending[edit]
Andrew Steuerman heads Golub Capital’s Middle Market Lending team located in Chicago and New York. The business line focuses on providing senior, one-stop, and second lien debt to U.S. middle market companies, typically controlled by private equity firms.[14][12] Golub Capital can hold over $400 million in each middle market lending deal,[23] and the team can also underwrite and syndicate senior credit facilities and a proprietary suite of one-loan debt facilities of up to $750 million.[24] The typical borrower generates between $5 million to $50 million a year in EBITDA and is backed by one of over 200 private equity companies with which Golub Capital has a working relationship.[20] Approximately 85% of financings done with private equity companies come from pre-existing relationships.[14]
Late Stage Lending[edit]
The firm's late stage lending unit is also headed by Andrew Steuerman.[2] The team operates out of the firm's San Francisco office in order to be closer to Silicon Valley.[4] The business offers debt to fast-growing technology companies backed by venture capital, growth equity, private equity, or other private companies.[4][6]
Broadly Syndicated Loans[edit]
Golub Capital's Broadly Syndicated Loans group is headed by Christina Jamieson in the firm's Chicago office.[9][14] This unit focuses on investing in larger loans that are generally liquid in the secondary market. The Broadly Syndicated Loans team also manages a series of collateralized loan obligations.[25]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc.[edit]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc., (a business development company) was founded in 2009 and went public in March 2010 NASDAQ: GBDC.[15] David Golub serves as the President and CEO of the company.[16] The company lends money to middle market companies that have backing from private equity firms.[26]
Recognition and awards[edit]
Golub Capital has received substantial industry recognition since 2009. In 2016, it was awarded "Lender of the Year, Americas," "Senior Lender of the Year, Americas," and "Business Development Company of the Year" by Private Debt Investor.[27] In 2015, Private Debt Investor named Golub Capital "Lender of the Year" and "Unitranche Lender of the Year."[11] Also in 2015, Golub Capital BDC, Inc. was named "Best Business Development Company" by Creditflux.[28][29] In 2014, the firm was recognized by Private Debt Investor as the 10th largest private debt fund manager.[30] In 2012, Golub Capital was named the "Lender Firm of the Year" by both M&A Advisor and ACG New York.[31] Buyouts Magazine named Golub Capital the "Middle Market Lender of the Year" in 2009 and 2010.[9][13] Golub Capital has received numerous awards from Mergers & Acquisitions including "2008 Lender of the Year,"[32] "Debt Financing Agent of the Year" in 2010,[13] and Lender of the Year in 2017.[23]

The business line focuses on providing senior, one-stop, and second lien debt to U.S. middle market companies, typically controlled by private equity firms.[14][12] Golub Capital can hold over $400 million in each middle market lending deal,[23] and the team can also underwrite and syndicate senior credit facilities and a proprietary suite of one-loan debt facilities of up to $750 million.[24] The typical borrower generates between $5 million to $50 million a year in EBITDA and is backed by one of over 200 private equity companies with which Golub Capital has a working relationship.[20] Approximately 85% of financings done with private equity companies come from pre-existing relationships.[14]
Late Stage Lending[edit]
The firm's late stage lending unit is also headed by Andrew Steuerman.[2] The team operates out of the firm's San Francisco office in order to be closer to Silicon Valley.[4] The business offers debt to fast-growing technology companies backed by venture capital, growth equity, private equity, or other private companies.[4][6]
Broadly Syndicated Loans[edit]
Golub Capital's Broadly Syndicated Loans group is headed by Christina Jamieson in the firm's Chicago office.[9][14] This unit focuses on investing in larger loans that are generally liquid in the secondary market. The Broadly Syndicated Loans team also manages a series of collateralized loan obligations.[25]

Our Firm | Golub Capital























































  









Our FirmGolub Capital Knows Middle Market Credit.
And No One Executes Better.


For more than two decades, we have defined and refined middle market lending, delivering solutions for middle market companies and private equity sponsors. We pioneered the one-stop, or unitranche (“GOLD”) loan, and we continue to develop new structures to support our lending partners. Our expertise and our disciplined processes enable us to respond with speed, consistency and reliability, inspiring repeat clients again and again.





Today, Golub Capital has over $20 billion of capital under management, with lending offices in Chicago, New York and San Francisco, and a focus on three business lines:





Middle Market Lending: Offering senior, one-stop and second lien loans to US middle market companies
Late Stage Lending: Providing flexible debt for fast-growing tech companies to expand without significant equity dilution
Broadly Syndicated Loans: Curating a portfolio of liquid senior secured loans to larger enterprises



APPROACH


Golub Capital uses a “bottom-up,” granular and analytic approach to credit. We seek to be nimble decision makers but strive to preserve capital by maintaining disciplined controls and processes. We prefer to present unique solutions tailored to address the circumstances at hand.


GOLD STANDARD PROCESS:



World-class middle and back office
Market leading policies, procedures and systems
Transparency
$10 million+ invested in technology systems
Customized loan management systems

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

            Approach all business dealings, marketplace transactions and commitments with integrity.
            
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to:
            
1. Avoid involvement, by the business or its principles, in activities that reflect unfavorably on, or otherwise adversely affect the public image of BBB or its accredited businesses.












BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
