With strong positions in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Texas, Exelon’s competitive advantage is its large inventory of clean-energy generation, including the nation’s largest nuclear generation fleet and a growing renewable energy business. Cornew also oversees Constellation, Exelon’s competitive retail and commodities business, which provides electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products and services to customers in 48 states, the District of Columbia and parts of Canada.
Prior to his current role, Cornew was president and CEO of Constellation. Before holding that position, Cornew was senior vice president of Exelon and president of Exelon Power Team, overseeing the power marketing and trading function of Exelon Generation’s portfolio and was responsible for Exelon’s retail business, which served electric and gas retail customers in Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
Cornew holds a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Rutgers University and a Master’s degree in Business Administration from Drexel University.
