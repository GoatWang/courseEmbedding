ProQR Therapeutics's Investigational Drug QRX-411 for Usher Syndrome Receives Orphan Drug Designation from U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency
Jul 5 17
ProQR Therapeutics N.V. announced that the company’s investigational drug QRX-411 has received orphan drug designation (ODD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, including Usher syndrome, the subtype targeted by QRX-411. Usher syndrome is the leading cause of combined deafness and blindness due to genetic defects in the Usher gene. ODD in the U.S. and European Union provides a special status for investigational drugs being developed for rare diseases. The ODD programs offer development program tax benefits and a waiver of the NDA application user fee, as well as market exclusivity for up to seven years in the U.S., and ten years in the European Union following market approval. ProQR’s growing ophthalmology portfolio includes: QR-110 for Leber’s congenital amaurosis Type 10 (LCA 10) due to the p.Cys998X mutation, which received IND and CTA clearance and is in clinical development (PQ-110-001 Phase 1/2 safety and efficacy study). QR-110 was also granted Fast Track designation by the FDA and Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and EMA. QRX-411 for Usher syndrome type II due to the PE-40 mutation in the USH2A gene, for which a clinical candidate has been selected and is ready for IND enabling development studies. QRX-421 for Usher syndrome type II due to Exon 13 mutations in the USH2A gene, for which a clinical candidate has been selected and is ready for IND enabling development studies. QRX-1011 for Stargardt’s disease due to c.5461-10T>C mutations in the ABCA4 gene, which is in optimization phase.

	For the periods presented in these financial statements, the potential exercise of share options and the conversion of preferred shares into ordinary shares in 2014 are not included in the diluted earnings per share
	calculation as the Company was loss-making in all periods. Due to the anti-dilutive nature of the outstanding options, basic and diluted earnings per share are equal.

	2. Significant Accounting Policies



	These condensed
	consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), in particular IAS 34 - Interim
	Financial Reporting. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS have been condensed or omitted. Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
	conjunction with the Companys annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
	included in the condensed consolidated financial statements.


	The Companys financial results have varied substantially, and are expected to continue
	to vary, from period to period. The Company believes that its ordinary activities are not linked to any particular seasonal factors.


	The Company operates
	in one reportable segment, which comprises the discovery and development of innovative, RNA based therapeutics.



	3. Adoption of new and revised
	International Financial Reporting Standards



	The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are
	consistent with those applied in the preparation of the Companys annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014. New Standards and Interpretations, which became effective as of January 1, 2015, did not have a
	material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.


	 


	5






	4. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments



	In the application of the Companys accounting policies, management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of
	assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
	estimates.


	The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in
	which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.



	(a) Share-based payments



	Share options granted to
	employees and consultants are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Fair value is determined through the use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is considered the most appropriate model for this purpose by
	management.


	Initially, the Companys ordinary shares were not publicly traded and consequently the Company needed to estimate the fair value of its
	share and the expected volatility of that value. Please refer to the Companys annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 for the assumptions used in those estimates. The value of the underlying shares was determined
	on the basis of the prior sale of company stock method. As such, the Company has benchmarked the value per share to external transactions of Company shares and external financing rounds.


	For options granted on September 17, 2014, the Company used the opening price of the Companys stock on September 18, 2014, the first day of
	trading of the Companys stock on the Nasdag Global Market, which amounted to US$13.00 (10.03) as the value of its ordinary shares.


	For
	all options granted subsequent to the initial public offering, the Company uses the closing price of the ordinary shares on the previous business day as the exercise price of the options granted.


	The result of the share option valuations and the related compensation expense is dependent on the model and input parameters used. Even though Management
	considers the fair values reasonable and defensible based on the methodologies applied and the information available, others might derive a different fair value for the Companys share options.



	(b) Corporate income taxes



	The Company recognizes
	deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or tax credits only to the extent that the Company has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the
	unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilized. Managements judgment is that such convincing evidence is currently not sufficiently available and a deferred tax asset is therefore only recognized to the extent that the Company has
	sufficient taxable temporary differences.



	(c) Research and development expenditures



	Research expenditures are currently not capitalized but are reflected in the income statement because the criteria for capitalization are not met. At each
	balance sheet date, the Company estimates the level of service performed by the vendors and the associated costs incurred for the services performed.


	Although we do not expect the estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, the understanding of the status and timing of services
	performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in reporting amounts that vary in any particular period.


	 


	6





	The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures for critical accounting estimates
	and judgments that are required in the annual consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Companys annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014.



	5. Cash and Cash Equivalents



	At December 31, 2015,
	the Companys cash and equivalents were  94,865,000 as compared to 112,736,000 at December 31, 2014. A significant portion of the cash balance is denominated in US dollars. The cash balances are held at banks with investment
	grade credit ratings. The cash at banks is at full disposal of the Company.



	6. Current liabilities



	At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the other current liabilities consisted principally of accruals for services provided by vendors not yet
	billed and other miscellaneous liabilities. The accrued liabilities as at December 31, 2015 increased significantly compared to December 31, 2014 as both our activities and our number of employees increased significantly compared to last
	year.

	Innovation credit (Innovatiekrediet)



	On June 1, 2012, ProQR was awarded an Innovation credit by the Dutch government, through its agency RVO (previously: AgentschapNL) of the
	Ministry of Economic Affairs, for the Companys cystic fibrosis program. The credit was increased in the course of 2013, 2014 and 2015. The credit covers 35% of the costs incurred in respect of the program up to an initial maximum of 
	5.0 million through December 31, 2016.


	The credit is interest-bearing at a rate of 10% per annum. The credit, including accrued interest,
	is repayable in three instalments on August 31, 2017, August 31, 2018 and August 31, 2019, depending on the technical success of the program.


	The assets which are co-financed with the granted innovation credit are subject to a right of pledge for the benefit of RVO.



	8. Shareholders equity



	The authorized share
	capital of the Company amounting to  934,000 consists of 23,345,965 ordinary shares with a nominal value of  0.04 per share. All issued shares have been fully paid in cash.


	On September 15, 2014, the general meeting of shareholders of the Company resolved to approve and effect a capital reorganization, including a share
	split and bonus share issuance. The combined effect of the share split and bonus share issuance was a 101.804232-for-1 share split of the outstanding ordinary and preferred shares held by the Companys shareholders. This share split became
	effective on September 15, 2014.


	All share, per-share and related information presented in the comparative figures of these condensed consolidated
	financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, to reflect the impact of the share split.


	 


	7





	On September 18, 2014, the Company was listed at the NASDAQ Global Market under ticker symbol PRQR. In
	connection with this listing, the Company issued a total of 8,625,000 ordinary shares against the initial public offering price of $ 13.00, resulting in gross proceeds of $ 112,125,000 ( 87,202,000). The number of shares issued includes the
	exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters. The net proceeds raised in the offering amounted to  80,376,000, net of  8,589,000 of underwriting discounts and offering expenses, of which  6,826,000 was processed
	through share premium and  1,763,000 was included in the statement of comprehensive loss as general and administrative costs.


	All of the issued
	preferred shares were converted into the Companys ordinary shares. The conversion rate for the preferred shares was one-to-one, adjusted for the stock splits.



	Treasury shares



	All treasury shares presented in the
	statement of changes in equity relate to ordinary shares that have legally been issued, but that are within control of the Company. Therefore, these shares are presented as treasury shares.



	Share options



	The Company operates an equity-settled
	share-based compensation plan which was introduced in 2013. The supervisory board may grant options to employees, members of the supervisory board, members of the management board and consultants. Total compensation expenses included in operating
	costs for this plan in 2015 were  1,212,000 (2014:  646,000), of which  801,000 (2014: 404,000) was recorded in general and administrative costs and  411,000 (2014:  242,000) was recorded in research and
	development costs.



	9. Other income



	Other income
	increased to  3,235,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 313,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and comprised income related to grants. Other income particularly increased in 2015 resulting from the 
	6 million grant from the European Commission (EC) under the Horizon 2020 program to finance the clinical development of QR-010.



	10. Research and
	development costs



	Research and development costs increased to  23,401,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from  10,267,000 for
	the year ended December 31, 2014 and comprised of allocated employee costs including share-based payments, the costs of materials and laboratory consumables, outsourced activities, license and intellectual property costs and other allocated
	costs. The increase in expenses was primarily due to the advancement of QR-010 into clinical development and QR-110 from research into development as well as increased investments in our other research programs.


	 


	8






	11. General and administrative costs



	General and administrative costs amount to  6,837,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to  6,507,000 for the year ended
	December 31, 2014.



	12. Income taxes



	Due to the
	operating losses incurred since inception the Company has no tax provisions as of the balance sheet date. Furthermore, no significant temporary differences exist between accounting and tax results. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on
	future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the Company has not yet recognized any deferred tax asset related to operating losses.



	13. Events after balance sheet date



	No significant
	events have occurred after balance sheet date.

	Exhibit 99.2




	ProQR Announces Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015




	LEIDEN, the Netherlands, February 17, 2016

	 ProQR Therapeutics N.V. (Nasdaq:PRQR), a company dedicated to changing lives through the
	creation of transformative RNA medicines for the treatment of severe genetic diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF) and Lebers congenital amaurosis (LCA), today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015.


	2015 was a year of execution for ProQR. From the inception of ProQR in 2012, we had been working towards taking QR-010 into the clinic and in 2015 we
	started two global clinical studies, said Daniel de Boer, Chief Executive Officer of ProQR. During 2015, we have further executed on our strategy to build ProQR into a global company with multiple programs that include QR-110 for LCA
	patients moving into development and the advancement of our discovery programs in several severe genetic disorders. With the opening of our U.S. office in Palo Alto, the growing talent in our organization, now at 125 ProQRians, and the pipeline of
	potential new product candidates we look forward to an exciting 2016.



	Financial Highlights



	At December 31, 2015, ProQR held cash and cash equivalents of 94.9 million, compared to 112.7 million at December 31, 2014. The
	decrease in cash was driven by operating expenses, partially offset by receipt of grants and foreign currency gains. Net cash used in operating activities during the three month period and full year ended December 31, 2015 was
	6.8 million and 24.2 million respectively, compared to 5.0 million and 14.5 million for the same period last year.


	Other income increased to 3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 0.3 million in 2014 and comprised income related to
	grants. For the full year ended 2015, other income increased due to the 6.0 million grant from the European Commission (EC) under the Horizon 2020 program to finance the clinical development of QR-010.


	Research and development costs increased to 6.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 from 3.3 million for the same
	period in 2014. Research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 23.4 million, compared to 10.3 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the start of our clinical
	studies, expansion of our toxicology studies, increased investments in our other research programs and the overall growth in the Company.


	General and
	administrative costs remained at 2.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 as it was for the same period in 2014. General and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 6.8 million,
	compared to 6.5 million for the same period in 2014.


	Net result for the three month period ended December 31, 2015 was a
	6.1 million loss or 0.26 per share, compared to a 2.0 million loss or 0.09 per share for the same period in 2014. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 20.8 million or
	0.89 per share, compared to 12.1 million, or 1.09 per share for the same period ended December 31, 2014. For further financial information for the period ending December 31, 2015, please refer to the
	financial statements appearing at the end of this release.






	Corporate Highlights in 2015



	 




	 


	


	 


	In 2015, just three and-a-half years after its inception, ProQR started two global clinical studies of QR-010, a novel investigational RNA therapeutic designed to repair the genetic mutation in the mRNA of CF patients
	due to the

	D

	F508 mutation. The first study called PQ-010-001 is a global Phase 1b clinical study that is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 28-day study being conducted in approximately 20
	centers worldwide. This first-in-human study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses of inhaled QR-010 in 64 CF patients homozygous (carrying two copies) for the

	D

	F508 mutation. As exploratory efficacy endpoints this study is also assessing sweat chloride, weight gain, CFQ-R Respiratory Symptom Score and lung function, measured by FEV1. The study is not powered for
	statistical significance on these exploratory endpoints. The second study called PQ-010-002 is a proof-of-concept study evaluating the effect of QR-010 on an important measurement of CFTR function, the nasal potential difference (NPD). This
	proof-of-concept study is a case-controlled, open label 28-day study being conducted in 5 specialized centers in the US and Europe. The study plans to enroll 16 CF patients, 8 homozygous (carrying two copies) for the

	D

	F508 mutation and 8 compound heterozygous (one copy of the

	D

	F508 plus one other CF disease causing mutation) with the option to enroll an additional 16. The
	NPD assay selectively measures the activity of the impaired CFTR protein in the nasal epithelium in CF patients. Restoration of NPD to normal levels will demonstrate an important proof of the effect of QR-010 on CFTR function, a benefit that has
	already been demonstrated in a mouse model with the

	D

	F508 mutation. Both study PQ-010-001 and PQ-010-002 are actively enrolling patients and top-line results for both studies are expected mid to late
	2016.




	 




	 


	


	 


	During the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference (NACFC) in October, ProQR presented encouraging pre-clinical data that shows QR-010 is stable in CF mucus, transits through the mucus in a clinically meaningful time,
	is absorbed systemically after inhalation, and is stable in the presence of commonly used inhaled medications (dornase alfa (Pulmozyme

	®

	), fluticasone and salbutamol). In vitro, QR-010 was
	demonstrated to be stable in CF sputum and diffuse easily through

	in vitro

	CF mucus models. Using a mouse model with CF-like lung phenotype, it was shown that after inhalation, QR-010 is absorbed systemically and is delivered to extra
	pulmonary organs that are also compromised in CF.




	 




	 


	


	 


	ProQR progressed QR-110, its second molecule, into preclinical development for the indication of Lebers congenital amaurosis (LCA) due to the p.Cys998X mutation in the CEP290 gene. LCA is a rare disease without
	any known treatment and is the most common cause of genetic blindness in childhood. QR-110 is an RNA oligonucleotide designed to repair the p.Cys998X mutation in the CEP290 mRNA in LCA patients. Preclinical data will be presented at the Association
	for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) conference in May 2016. The company is moving this program through pre-clinical development towards clinical studies in 2016.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Over 2015, ProQR grew its in house discovery group, strengthening its RNA technologies and patent portfolio. ProQR announced that future programs amongst many others may include RNA based oligonucleotides for the
	treatment of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, Usher syndrome, Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), Huntingtons disease, Friedreichs ataxia, and Alzheimers disease. ProQR will host an R&D Day for investors on
	March 14, 2016 in New York City and will highlight the efforts across the therapeutic areas of pulmonology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and neurology.




	 




	 


	


	 


	In 2015 the company and its academic partners received a grant from the European Union under the Horizon 2020 program. The maximum amount of 6.0 million was granted to support the clinical development of
	QR-010. ProQR also received additional tranches totaling 1.6 million under the Innovation credit program or Innovatiekrediet by the Dutch government, through its agency RVO (previously: AgentschapNL) of the
	Ministry of Economic Affairs, for the cystic fibrosis development program.




	 




	 


	


	 


	ProQR strengthened its Supervisory Board with the appointment of Paul Baart in June 2015. He is also the new Chair of the Audit Committee. Paul was a former member of the Global Board at Price Waterhouse Cooper
	International and is a renowned expert in accounting and finance.









	 


	


	 


	ProQR opened an office in Palo Alto, California. This provides ProQR the opportunity to build the company on a global scale.





	Subsequent events



	 




	 


	


	 


	James Shannon, MD has been nominated to serve as a full member of the Supervisory Board, to be appointed at the 2016 Annual General Shareholders Meeting. James brings significant experience to the Supervisory Board
	through his extensive career in drug development and pharma. From 2012 until his retirement in 2015, James was Chief Medical Officer at GlaxoSmithKline. Prior to that he was Global Head of Pharma Development at Novartis and Senior Vice-President,
	Clinical Development at Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceuticals. He held board positions at companies including Biotie, Circassia, Crucell, Endocyte, MannKind and Cerimon Pharmaceuticals. He received his undergraduate and postgraduate degrees at
	Queens University of Belfast and is a Member of the Royal College of Physicians (UK). The company believes James broad knowledge and expertise will be of significant value to the Supervisory Board.





	About QR-010



	QR-010 is a first-in-class RNA-based
	oligonucleotide designed to address the underlying cause of the disease by repairing the mRNA defect encoded by the

	D

	F508 mutation in the CFTR gene of CF patients. The

	D

	F508 mutation is a deletion of three of the coding base pairs, or nucleotides, in the CFTR gene, which results in the production of a misfolded CFTR protein that does not function normally. QR-010 is
	designed to bind to the defective CFTR mRNA and guide the insertion of the three missing nucleotides, thus repairing the mRNA and subsequently producing wild-type, or normal CFTR protein. QR-010 is designed to be self-administered through a small,
	handheld aerosol delivery device, or nebulizer, in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs. We believe this method could allow maximum exposure of QR-010 to the primary target organ, the lung, as well as significant exposure to other affected
	organs through systemic absorption into the blood. QR-010 has been granted orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union. The QR-010 project has received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and
	innovation programme under grant agreement No 633545.



	About QR-110



	QR-110 is a first-in-class oligonucleotide, designed to address the underlying cause of Lebers congenital amaurosis due to the p.Cys998X mutation in the
	CEP290 gene. The p.Cys998X mutation is a substitution of one nucleotide in the pre-mRNA that leads to aberrant splicing of the mRNA and non-functional protein. QR-110 is designed to restore wild-type CEP290 mRNA leading to the production of
	wild-type CEP290 protein by binding to the mutated location in the pre-mRNA causing normal splicing of the pre-mRNA. QR-110 is intended to be administered through intravitreal injections in the eye.

	calculation as the Company was loss-making in all periods. Due to the anti-dilutive nature of the outstanding options, basic and diluted earnings per share are equal.

Innovation Programs


About the Innovation Unit
We have identified five therapeutic areas that show high potential for RNA based therapies including lung diseases, eye diseases, skin diseases, central nervous system diseases and neuromuscular diseases. We are employing our toolbox of RNA technologies to target severe genetic diseases and grow the company’s pipeline beyond cystic fibrosis and Leber’s congenital amaurosis. The efforts in the innovation unit have resulted in the current pipeline including programs for Usher syndrome, Fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Friedreich’s ataxia.




Lung diseases

                    Besides our QR-010 program for cystic fibrosis (CF) caused by the F508del mutation we are working on other CFTR mutations that can potentially be treated using our RNA technologies. We could potentially target an additional 5% of the CF population with these programs.


Learn more about QR-010 for cystic fibrosis.



Eye diseases

                    Our ophthalmology group was founded on the basis that there are several severe genetic eye disorders that currently have very limited treatment options for which RNA based therapeutics have the potential to make a large impact. The eye is a well validated target for RNA based therapies given the approved RNA therapies for the eye, their long half-lives and potential for local delivery and therefore could be an important class of drugs for ophthalmic indications in the future. Besides the program in Leber’s congenital amaurosis, QR-110, that is currently being prepared for first clinical studies we are working on programs for other ophthalmic indications including QRX-411 for Usher syndrome and QRX-504 for Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD).


Learn more about QR-110 for Leber’s congenital amaurosis.

Usher syndrome & QRX-411 and QRX-421
What is Usher syndrome?
Usher syndrome is the leading cause of combined deafness and blindness. Patients with this syndrome generally progress to a stage in which they have very limited central vision and moderate to severe deafness.

What causes Usher syndrome?
Usher syndrome type II is most commonly caused by mutations (or defects) in a gene in the DNA called the USH2A gene. In the mutations we are targeting, the genetic defect results in the lack of a functional USH2A protein. Similar to CEP290 protein that we target in our QR-110 program for Leber’s congenital amaurosis, the USH2A protein that is defective in Usher syndrome type II is responsible for the proper functioning of the light perceiving cells (rods and cones) in the retina. 

Treatment
The moderate to severe deafness that patients experience with Usher syndrome type II is manageable with hearing aids or cochlear implants. However, there are currently no available treatment options for the vision loss associated with this disease. Our programs will target patients with mutations in USH2A with Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa patients which experience visual loss but do not suffer from hearing loss. 

About QRX-411
With our QRX-411 program, we aim to treat the c.7595-2144A>G mutation in the USH2A gene that leads to vision loss. Our single stranded RNA oligonucleotide aims to repair the genetic defect in the RNA in the eye, such that it leads to a normal “wild-type” mRNA, which then translates into normal protein, thereby modifying the underlying disease. 

About QRX-421
Our QRX-421 program targets vision loss caused by defects in a specific part of the USH2A gene called exon 13. Our single stranded RNA oligonucleotide aims to repair the genetic defect in the RNA in the eye, such that it leads to the expression of a shortened but functional protein restoration, thereby modifying the underlying disease.

Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy & QRX-504
What is Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD)?
FECD is a common inherited condition characterized by the dysfunction and degeneration of the corneal endothelium, a single cell layer on the inside of the cornea in the eye. There are different types of this disease and we focus on age-related FECD (FECD3). Some patients with age-related FECD develop advanced disease with corneal edema and corneal clouding. These symptoms can lead to complete vision loss and the need for surgery and a corneal transplant.

What causes Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy?
Most of age-related FECD is caused by a mutation (or defect) in the TCF4 gene.

Treatment
There are currently no other treatment options for any form of FECD patients with vision loss, apart from corneal transplantation or replacement of the corneal endothelial layer. This requires surgery where the damaged cornea is removed and replaced with a healthy donor cornea. However, transplantation has several limitations, including the availability of donors, risk of rejection, the inherent risk of an invasive procedure and is only available to patients with advanced FECD.

About QRX-504
Our program, QRX-504, aims to prevent corneal dystrophy in patients with a mutation in the TCF4 gene by using a single stranded RNA oligonucleotide.
                

Skin diseases

Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa & QR-313
What is dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB)?
DEB is a severe genetic orphan disease that affects the connective tissues including the skin and mucosal tissues. Children with DEB are often called ‘Butterfly children’ due to their fragile skin; blistering and skin erosions occur upon the slightest touch or even spontaneously. Symptoms include open wounds, skin infections, fusion of fingers and toes (pseudosyndactyly), gastrointestinal tract problems and eventually patients develop lethal squamous cell carcinoma.

What causes DEB?
DEB is caused by mutation(s) (or defects) in a gene in the DNA called the COL7A1 gene. This gene is responsible for the formation of protein collagen type VII that forms anchoring fibrils that bind the different skin layers together. The defects can occur in different parts of the COL7A1 gene causing loss or dysmalfunctioning of the anchoring fibrils and fragile skin.

Treatment
Although there are treatment options that help the healing of wounds in DEB patients, there is no approved treatment available that target the underlying cause of for any type of DEB.

About QRX-313
Our program, QRX-313, targets all DEB caused by defects in a specific part of the COL7A1 gene called exon 73. By excluding this exon 73 from the RNA that harbors the defect, we hope to restore functionality of the anchoring fibrils.

                

Central Nervous System diseases

                    In our CNS group we are working on product candidates for several disease targets, including QRX-203 for Alzheimer’s disease and QRX-704 for Huntington’s disease. 
                

Neuromuscular diseases

                    Within our neuromuscular group we are working on a program called QRX-604 that aims to increase Frataxin protein levels in people with Friedreich’s ataxia.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of $88.4
million (€67.0 million), after deducting underwriting discounts and any offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares, we estimate that the net proceeds of the offering will be
$102.0 million (€77.3 million). As of June 30, 2014, we had cash and cash
equivalents of approximately $50.4 million (€38.2 million).

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations and development of QR-010, to establish a public market
for our ordinary shares and to facilitate our future access to the public
capital markets. We estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents as follows:

. approximately $33.3 million (€25.2 million) to fund development costs     
  associated with our planned Phase 1b clinical trial and POC trial for QR-010;

. approximately $32.2 million (€24.4 million) to fund development costs     
  associated with our planned Phase 2a clinical trials for QR-010; 

. approximately $12.0 million (€9.1 million) to fund development costs      
  associated with pre-clinical studies and related activities for QR-110; and

. the remainder for discovery and other pipeline projects, as well as for   
  working capital and other general corporate purposes and potentially for  
  acquisitions or investments in other businesses, technologies or product  
  candidates. 

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management board retains broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering. We have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products,
businesses or technologies.

We intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in a variety of capital
preservation investments, which may include term deposits, short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and government securities, all in
accordance with our investment policy.


The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and
significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic
drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research
institutions. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our
product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile,
reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of our
existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial,
technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in
the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA, EMA and
other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those
products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small
number of our competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful
than we may be in obtaining FDA or EMA approval for therapies and achieving
widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ products may be more effective,
or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may
commercialize and may render our therapies obsolete or non-competitive before we
can recover development and commercialization expenses.

A number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for
the treatment of CF, including Vertex, Novartis, Pfizer, Genzyme, which is a
division of Sanofi, Insmed, Targeted Genetics, Bayer and several private
companies. Of these, Vertex’s Kalydeco is the only drug approved to treat an
underlying cause of CF, rather than the symptoms. Kalydeco was initially
approved to treat CF patients with the G551D mutation and in 2014, Kalydeco’s
label was expanded to include eight additional gating mutations. Vertex has
estimated that approximately 2,400 CF patients in the U.S., Europe and Australia
have a G551D or a non-G551D gating mutation. Vertex is currently seeking
marketing approval for additional mutations, which would increase Kalydeco’s
target population to up to 10% of the total CF patient population. Other drugs
that have been approved for CF patients are palliative treatments that manage
the symptoms of the disease, such as Novartis’ TOBI and Gilead’s Cayston, which
are used to suppress chronic lung infections, and Roche’s Pulmozyme, which is an
inhaled therapy used to thin mucus.

Among the product candidates that are currently in development for CF patients,
we believe Vertex’s VX-809 is the most advanced. VX-809 is a small molecule
“corrector” that aims to transport non-functional CFTR protein to the cell
membrane to achieve some level of activity in the damaged protein. VX-809 is
intended for a much broader CF patient population than Kalydeco and includes
patients who are homozygous for the F508 mutation. In June 2014, Vertex
announced that its two Phase 3 clinical trials of lumacaftor, when used in
combination with Kalydeco in CF patients homozygous for the F508 mutation,
showed statistically significant improvement in the study’s primary endpoint of
improved lung function, compared to placebo.

Our other competitors have research and development programs directed at
identifying and developing CFTR potentiators, CFTR correctors and drug
candidates with other mechanisms of action that seek to address the underlying 
cause of CF. Vertex’s success in developing and commercializing Kalydeco and 
VX-809, if approved, could increase the resources that our competitors allocate
to the development of these potential treatments for CF. Other than VX-809, 
none of the other companies have listed a F508 specific compound clinical trial
on www.clinicaltrials.gov. Our competitors may also obtain FDA, EMA or other 
regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval
for ours. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as
new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.


Company Description
We are an innovative biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and
development of RNA-based therapeutics for the treatment of severe genetic
disorders, with an initial focus on Cystic Fibrosis, or CF. Utilizing our
unique, proprietary RNA repair technologies, we believe we will be able to


 treat
genetic disorders in which a single protein is defective due to certain types of
genetic mutation. We design our therapeutic candidates to specifically target
and repair the defective messenger RNA, or mRNA, that is a product of a mutated
gene in order to restore the expression and function of normal, or wild-type,
protein. Our technologies employ single-stranded RNA-based oligonucleotides,
which act as guide sequences to repair the targeted abnormal mRNA. The repaired
mRNA then acts as a template to generate wild-type protein to address the
underlying cause of the genetic disorder. We believe that this is a unique
approach that offers advantages compared with small molecule, gene therapy and
other therapeutic strategies.

Our current efforts are dedicated to the development of a disease-modifying
therapy for the treatment of CF, the most common fatal inherited disease in the
western world, which affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide.
We are also developing a treatment for Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis, or LCA, the
leading genetic cause of blindness in childhood. Further, based on our own
research and initial selection criteria, we believe that our RNA repair
technologies can potentially be used to treat a broad range of other severe
genetic diseases that are currently untreatable or have limited effective
treatment options and, to date, we have identified more than 50 potential target
indications. Since we began operations in May 2012, we have raised approximately
€45.6 million from private placements of equity securities. In addition, we have
received grants, loans and other funding from CF-focused patient organizations
and government institutions supporting our program for CF, including from Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., a subsidiary of the Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation.

beperkte aansprakelijkheid)incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and
prior to the completion of this offering we intend to convert to a public
company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap).

Severe Genetic Disorders

More than 70,000 patients worldwide suffer from cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease with a limited life expectancy. Leber’s congenital amaurosis affects approximately 15,000 patients in the Western world and there is currently no disease modifying treatment available for this blinding disease. Learn more about our missions and how we aim to change the course of severe genetic disorders. Read more

					Full Description



ProQR Therapeutics N.V. (ProQR), formerly ProQR Therapeutics B.V., is a pre-clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in the discovery and development of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)-based therapeutics for the treatment of severe genetic disorders. Utilizing its RNA repair technologies, the Company is developing a pipeline in severe genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). The Company designs its therapeutic candidates to specifically target and repair the defective messenger RNA, or Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA), that is transcribed from a mutated gene in order to restore the expression and function of normal, or wild-type protein. The Company's product candidates include QR-010 and QR-110. The Company is focusing on developing QRX- 911, QRX- 021, QRX- 313 for Epidermolysis bullosa, QRX- 704 for Huntington's disease, QRX- 812, QRX- 411 for Usher syndrome, QRX- 504 for Fuchs, QRX- 604 for Friedreich's ataxia and QRX- 203 for Alzheimer's disease.QR-010The Company's lead product candidate, QR-010, is an RNA-based oligonucleotide. QR-010 is designed to address the underlying cause of the disease by repairing the mRNA defect encoded by the delta-F508 mutation in the Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene of CF patients. The delta-F508 mutation is a deletion of over three of the coding base pairs or nucleotides, in the CFTR gene, which results in the production of a misfolded CFTR protein that does not function normally. QR-110 is designed to bind to the mutated location in the pre-mRNA, thereby leading to normally spliced or wild-type mRNA, which could produce wild-type or normal protein. QR-110 is designed to be administered through intravitreal injections in the eye.QR-110The Company's product candidate, QR-110, is an oligonucleotide. QR-110 is designed to treat the disease by repairing the underlying cause in the mRNA, which results in the production of wild-type centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290 protein). QR-110 is designed to bind to the mutated location in the pre-mRNA, masking the cryptic splice site, thereby leading to normally spliced or wild-type mRNA, which could produce wild-type or normal protein. QR-110 is designed to be administered through intravitreal injections in the eye.The Company competes with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Novartis International AG, Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., Pfizer Inc., Galapagos, AbbVie Laboratories, Shire, Sanofi, Bayer AG, Proteostasis, Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Nivalis and Gilead.
