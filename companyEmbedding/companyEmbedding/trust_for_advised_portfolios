��������No
person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representations other
than those contained in this SAI and the Prospectus dated January 31, 2007 (as supplemented May 10, 2007), and, if given
or made, such information or representations may not be relied upon as having been
authorized by Lotsoff Capital Management Investment Trust. 
��������This
SAI does not constitute an offer to sell securities. 

FUND HISTORY AND
CLASSIFICATION 
��������The
Lotsoff Capital Management Investment Trust is an open-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the �1940
Act�). The Trust currently has two portfolios (each a �Fund�, and,
collectively, the �Funds�): Lotsoff Capital Management Micro Cap Fund (the
�Micro Cap Fund�) and Lotsoff Capital Management Active Income Fund (the
�Active Income Fund�). The Micro Cap Fund is a diversified fund. The Active
Income Fund is a non-diversified fund, which means the Active Income Fund can invest more
of its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. The Trust was
organized as a Delaware statutory trust on August 28, 2003. Prior to June 1, 2005, the
Trust was named �Lotsoff Capital Management Equity Trust�. 
INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 
��������The
Trust has adopted the following restrictions applicable to the Funds as fundamental
policies, which may not be changed without the approval of the holders of a
�majority,� as defined in the 1940 Act, of the shares of the Fund in question.
Under the 1940 Act, approval of the holders of a �majority� of a Fund�s
outstanding voting securities means the favorable vote of the holders of the lesser of (i)
67% of its shares represented at a meeting at which more than 50% of its outstanding
shares are represented or (ii) more than 50% of its outstanding shares. If a percentage
restriction is adhered to at the time of investment, a later increase or decrease in
percentage resulting from a change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of
that restriction other than with respect to a Fund�s borrowing of money. 
��������Neither
of the Funds may: 
��������1.����  Purchase
the securities of any issuer if such purchase would cause more than 5%  of the
value of the Fund�s total assets to be invested in securities of any  one
issuer (except securities of the United States Government or any agency or
  instrumentality thereof), or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities
  of any one issuer (except that up to 25% of the value of the Micro Cap
  Fund�s total assets may be invested without regard to these limitations
and  up to 50% of the value of the Active Income Fund�s total assets may be
  invested without regard to these limitations).  
��������2.����  Borrow
money to an extent or in a manner not permitted under the 1940 Act. (For
  purposes of this investment restriction, the entry into reverse repurchase
  agreements shall constitute borrowing, but the entry into options, forward
  contracts, futures contracts, swap contracts, including those related to
  indices, and various options on swaps and futures contracts shall not
constitute  borrowing.)  
��������3.����  Invest
in real estate (although each Fund may purchase securities secured by  real
estate or interests therein, or securities issued by companies that invest  in
real estate or interests therein), commodities, commodities contracts or
  interests in oil, gas and/or mineral exploration or development programs,
except  that each Fund may invest in financial futures contracts, options
thereon, and  other similar instruments.  
��������4.����  Act
as an underwriter or distributor of securities other than shares of the  Fund,
except to the extent that the Fund may be deemed to be an underwriter  within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  �Securities Act�),
in the disposition of restricted securities.  
B-1 

��������5.����  Invest
in companies for the primary purpose of acquiring control or management
  thereof.  
��������6.����  Purchase
securities on margin. However, each Fund may obtain such short-term  credits as
may be necessary for the clearance of transactions and may make  margin payments
in connection with transactions in futures and options, and each  Fund may
borrow money to the extent and in the manner permitted by the 1940 Act,  as
provided in Investment Restriction No. 2.  
��������7.����  Sell
securities short and write put and call options to an extent not permitted  by
the 1940 Act.  
��������8.����  Pledge,
mortgage, hypothecate or otherwise encumber any of its assets, except to  secure
its borrowings.  
��������9.����  Concentrate
25% or more of the value of its total assets (taken at market value  at the time
of each investment) in securities of non-governmental issuers whose  principal
business activities are in the same industry.  
��������10.����  Make
loans, except that this restriction shall not prohibit the purchase and  holding
of a portion of an issue of publicly distributed debt securities (or the
  purchase of any type of debt obligation by the Active Income Fund) and
  securities of a type normally acquired by institutional investors and that each
  Fund may lend its portfolio securities.  
��������11.����  Issue
senior securities to an extent not permitted under the 1940 Act. (As of  the
date of this SAI, the 1940 Act permits each Fund to borrow money from banks
  provided that it maintains continuous asset coverage of at least 300% of all
  amounts borrowed. For purposes of this investment restriction, entry into the
  following transactions shall not constitute senior securities to the extent a
  Fund covers the transaction or maintains sufficient liquid assets in accordance
  with applicable requirements: when-issued securities transactions, forward roll
  transactions, short sales, forward commitments, futures contracts and reverse
  repurchase agreements. In addition, hedging transactions in which a Fund may
  engage and similar investment strategies are not treated as senior securities
  for purposes of this investment restriction.)  
��������The
Funds have adopted certain other investment restrictions which are not fundamental
policies and which may be changed by the Trust�s Board of Trustees without
shareholder approval. If a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of investment,
a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in values of assets
will not constitute a violation of that restriction other than with respect to a
Fund�s investments in illiquid securities. Any changes in these non-fundamental
investment restrictions made by the Board of Trustees will be communicated to shareholders
prior to their implementation. The non-fundamental investment restrictions are as follows: 
��������1.����  Neither
Fund will invest more than 15% of the value of its net assets in  illiquid
securities.  
��������2.����  Neither
Fund will purchase the securities of other investment companies except:  (a) as
part of a plan of merger, consolidation or reorganization approved by the
  shareholders of the Fund; (b) securities of registered open-end investment
  companies; or (c) securities of registered closed-end investment companies on
  the open market where no commission results, other than the usual and customary
  broker�s commission. No purchases described in (b) and (c) will be made if
  as a result of such purchases (i) the Fund and its affiliated persons would
hold  more than 3% of any class of securities, including voting securities, of
any  registered investment company; (ii) more than 5% of the Fund�s net
assets  would be invested in shares of any one registered investment company;
and (iii)  more than 10% of the Fund�s net assets would be invested in
shares of  registered investment companies.  
B-2 

��������3.����  In
accordance with the requirements of Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act, the Micro
  Cap Fund will normally invest 80% of the value of its net assets in common
  stocks of companies with market capitalizations that are below $500 million at
  the time of initial purchase (�micro cap companies�). If the Board of
  Trustees of the Trust determines to change this non-fundamental policy for the
  Micro Cap Fund, the Micro Cap Fund will provide 60 days prior written notice to
  the shareholders before implementing the change of policy. Any such notice will
  be provided in plain English in a separate written disclosure document
  containing the following prominent statement in bold-type: �Important
  Notice Regarding Change in Investment Policy.� If the notice is included
  with other communications to shareholders, the aforementioned statement will
  also be included on the envelope in which the notice is delivered.  
��������Each
Fund�s investment objective is a non-fundamental policy and may be changed by the
Trust�s Board of Trustees without shareholder approval. If the Board of Trustees of
the Trust determines to change the investment objective for either of the Funds, the
applicable Fund will provide 60 days prior written notice to the shareholders before
implementing the change of investment objective. 
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE 
Micro Cap Fund 
��������The
Micro Cap Fund�s investment objective is long-term capital appreciation, which it
seeks by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of micro cap
companies. The Micro Cap Fund will, under normal circumstances, invest at least 80% of its
assets in common stocks of micro cap companies. From time to time, the Micro Cap Fund may
invest in other equity-type securities such as convertible bonds, preferred stocks and
warrants to purchase common stock. The Micro Cap Fund may invest in securities not listed
on a national or regional securities exchange, but such securities typically will have an
established over-the-counter market. The Micro Cap Fund does not intend to invest in any
security that, at the time of purchase, is not readily marketable. The Micro Cap Fund may,
for temporary defensive purposes, invest more than 20% of its assets in money market
securities, including U.S. government obligations, certificates of deposit, bankers�
acceptances, commercial paper or cash and cash equivalents. Except for temporary defensive
purposes, the Micro Cap Fund will retain cash and cash equivalents only in amounts deemed
adequate for current needs and to permit the Micro Cap Fund to take advantage of
investment opportunities. 
Active Income Fund 
��������The
Active Income Fund seeks to provide high current income and capital appreciation. It
invests primarily in U.S. fixed income and floating rate securities, both investment and
non-investment grade credit quality (the Active Income Fund will not invest in bonds in
default). The Active Income Fund may also invest in dollar denominated and non-dollar
denominated bonds issued outside of the U.S., engage in short sales, utilize derivatives,
such as options and futures, and effect short-term transactions such as forward roll
transactions (with respect to forward roll transactions, the Active Income Fund covers the
transaction or maintains sufficient liquid assets in accordance with applicable
requirements). The Active Income Fund has no limit with respect to its portfolio maturity
or duration. The Active Income Fund may, for temporary defensive purposes, invest more
than 20% of its assets in money market securities, including U.S. government obligations,
certificates of deposit, bankers� acceptances, commercial paper or cash and cash
equivalents. Except for temporary defensive purposes, the Active Income Fund will retain
cash and cash equivalents only in amounts deemed adequate for current needs and to permit
it to pay its expenses, satisfy redemption requests or take advantage of investment
opportunities. 
B-3 

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
AND RISKS 
Principal Investment
Strategies and Risks Respecting the Micro Cap Fund 
��������Because
the Micro Cap Fund intends to invest mainly in common stocks of micro cap companies, an
investment in the Micro Cap Fund is subject to greater risks than those of funds that
invest in larger companies. 
��������Investments
in micro cap companies tend to be speculative and volatile. Relatively small companies may
lack depth in management on which to rely should loss of key personnel occur. Such
companies may have, or may develop, only a regional market for products or services and
may be adversely affected by purely local events. Further, relatively small companies also
may be involved in the development or marketing of new products or services, the market
for which may not have been established. Moreover, such companies may be unable to compete
with larger companies, which have more resources. Lastly, such companies may not have
access to adequate financing resulting in a higher risk of insolvency. 
��������Relative
to large companies, equity securities of micro cap companies are generally thinly traded
and often will be closely held with only a small proportion of the outstanding securities
held by the general public. In view of such factors, the Micro Cap Fund may assume
positions in securities with volatile share prices. Therefore, the current net asset value
(�NAV�) of the Micro Cap Fund may fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, the
Micro Cap Fund should not be considered suitable for investors who are unable or unwilling
to assume the risks of loss inherent in such a fund. 
Principal Investment
Strategies and Risks Respecting the Active Income Fund 
��������The
Active Income Fund invests primarily in U.S. fixed income and floating rate securities,
both investment and non-investment grade credit quality. The Active Income Fund is
actively managed and may invest in derivatives, including for speculative purposes. In
view of this, the Active Income Fund may be subject to above-average risk. 
��������The
Active Income Fund may invest in non-investment grade fixed-income securities (commonly
known as �junk bonds�) that are considered predominantly speculative by
traditional investment standards. Non-investment grade fixed-income securities and unrated
securities of comparable credit quality are subject to the increased risk of an
issuer�s inability to meet principal and interest payment obligations. These
securities may be subject to greater price volatility due to such factors as specific
corporate developments, interest rate sensitivity, negative perceptions of the junk bond
markets generally and less secondary market liquidity. 
B-4 

��������Derivatives.  From
time to time, the Active Income Fund may use derivatives for hedging
  (attempting to reduce risk by offsetting one investment position with another)
  or speculation (taking a position in the hope of increasing return). These
  derivative transactions will involve forward contracts, future contracts,
  options and swaps, including options on futures and swaps. The use of
derivative  instruments for both hedging and speculative purposes involves a
risk of loss or  depreciation possibly greater than that associated with
investing directly in  the underlying assets. For a more detailed discussion of
derivatives, please see  the section entitled �Derivatives� below.  
��������Short
Sales. The Active Income Fund may seek to realize additional gains through
short sale transactions in securities listed on one or more national securities exchanges,
or in unlisted securities. Short selling involves the sale of borrowed securities. At the
time a short sale is effected, the Fund incurs an obligation to replace the security
borrowed at whatever its price may be at the time the Fund purchases it for delivery to
the lender. The price at such time may be more or less than the price at which the
security was sold by the Fund. Until the security is replaced, the Fund is required to pay
the lender amounts equal to any dividend or interest which accrue during the period of the
loan. To borrow the security, the Fund also may be required to pay a premium, which would
increase the cost of the security sold. The proceeds of the short sale will be retained by
the broker, to the extent necessary to meet margin requirements, until the short position
is closed. 
��������Until
the Active Income Fund closes its short position or replaces the borrowed security, the
Fund will: (a) maintain cash or liquid securities at such a level that the amount
deposited in the account plus the amount deposited with the broker as collateral will
equal the current value of the security sold short; or (b) otherwise cover the Fund�s
short position. 
��������Corporate
Debt Securities. The Active Income Fund may invest in corporate debt
securities. Corporate debt securities include corporate bonds, debentures, notes and other
similar instruments, including certain convertible securities. Debt securities may be
acquired with warrants attached. Corporate income-producing securities also may include
forms of preferred or preference stock. The rate of interest on a corporate debt security
may be fixed, floating or variable, and may vary inversely with respect to a reference
rate such as interest rates or other financial indications. The Active Income Fund can
invest in corporate securities of any rating. The rate of return or return of principal on
some debt obligations may be linked or indexed to the level of exchange rates between the
U.S. dollar and a foreign currency or currencies. 
��������Variable
and Floating Rate Securities. Variable and floating rate securities provide
for a periodic adjustment in the interest rate paid on the obligations. The terms of such
obligations must provide that interest rates are adjusted periodically based upon an
interest rate adjustment index as provided in the respective obligations. The adjustment
intervals may be regular, and range from daily up to annually, or may be event based, such
as based on a change in the prime rate. 
��������The
Active Income Fund may invest in floating rate debt instruments (�floaters�).
The interest rate on a floater is a variable rate, which is tied to another interest rate,
such as a money-market index, like the London Interbank Offered Rate (�LIBOR�),
or U.S. Treasury bill rate. The interest rate on a floater resets periodically, typically
every six months. Because of the interest rate reset feature, floaters provide the Active
Income Fund with a certain degree of protection against rises in interest rates, although
the Active Income Fund will participate in any declines in interest rates as well. 
B-5 

��������The
Active Income Fund also may invest in inverse floating rate debt instruments
(�inverse floaters�). The interest rate on an inverse floater resets in the
opposite direction from the market rate of interest to which the inverse floater is
indexed or inversely to a multiple of the applicable index. An inverse floating rate
security may exhibit greater price volatility than a fixed rate obligation of similar
credit quality. 
��������High
Yield Securities. The Active Income Fund may invest in high yield, high
risk, lower-rated debt securities, including convertible securities. Investments in such
securities are subject to greater credit risks than higher rated securities. Debt
securities rated below investment grade have greater risks of default than investment
grade debt securities, including medium grade debt securities, and may in fact, be in
default. Issuers of �junk bonds� must offer higher yields to compensate for the
greater risk of default on the payment of principal and interest. 
��������The
market for high yield securities is subject to substantial volatility. For example, an
economic downturn may have a more significant effect on high yield securities and their
markets, as well as on the ability of securities issuers to repay principal and interest,
than on higher-rated securities and their issuers. Issuers of high yield securities may be
of low creditworthiness and the high yield securities may be subordinated to the claims of
senior lenders. During periods of economic downturn or rising interest rates the issuers
of high yield securities may have greater potential for insolvency and a higher incidence
of high yield bond defaults may be experienced. 
��������The
prices of high yield securities have been found to be less sensitive to interest rate
changes than higher-rated investments but are more sensitive to adverse economic changes
or individual corporate developments because of their lower credit quality. During an
economic downturn or substantial period of rising interest rates, highly leveraged issuers
may experience financial stress which would adversely affect their ability to service
their principal and interest payment obligations, to meet projected business goals, and to
obtain additional financing. If the issuer of a high yield convertible security owned by
the Active Income Fund defaults, the Active Income Fund may incur additional expenses in
seeking recovery. Periods of economic uncertainty and changes can be expected to result in
increased volatility of market prices of high yield securities and the Active Income
Fund�s NAV. Yields on high yield securities will fluctuate over time. Furthermore, in
the case of high yield securities structured as zero coupon or pay-in-kind securities,
their market prices are affected to a greater extent by interest rate changes and thereby
tend to be more volatile than market prices of securities which pay interest periodically
and in cash. 
��������The
secondary market for high yield securities may at times become less liquid or respond to
adverse publicity or investor perceptions making it more difficult for the Active Income
Fund to value accurately high yield securities or dispose of them. To the extent the
Active Income Fund owns or may acquire illiquid or restricted high yield securities, these
securities may involve special registration responsibilities, liabilities and costs, and
liquidity difficulties, and judgment will play a greater role in valuation because there
is less reliable and objective data available. 
B-6 

��������Special
tax considerations are associated with investing in high yield bonds structured as zero
coupon or pay-in-kind securities. The Active Income Fund will report the interest on these
securities as income even though it receives no cash interest until the security�s
maturity or payment date. Further, the Active Income Fund must distribute substantially
all of its income to its shareholders to qualify for pass-through treatment under the tax
law. Accordingly, the Active Income Fund may have to dispose of its portfolio securities
under disadvantageous circumstances to generate cash or may have to borrow to satisfy
distribution requirements. 
��������Credit
ratings evaluate the safety of principal and interest payments, not the market value risk
of high yield securities. Since credit rating agencies may fail to timely change the
credit ratings to reflect subsequent events, Lotsoff Capital Management, the Funds�
investment adviser (the �Adviser�), monitors the issuers of high-yield
convertible securities in the portfolio to determine if the issuers will have sufficient
cash flow and profits to meet required principal and interest payments, and to attempt to
assure the securities� liquidity so the Active Income Fund can meet redemption
requests. To the extent that the Active Income Fund invests in high yield securities, the
achievement of its investment objective may be more dependent, on the Adviser�s own
credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds. The Active Income Fund may
retain a portfolio security whose rating has been changed. 
Non-Principal Investment
Strategies and Risks Related to One or Both Funds 
��������Illiquid
Securities 
��������Each
Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in securities for which there is no readily
available market (�illiquid securities�). The 15% limitation includes certain
securities whose disposition would be subject to legal restrictions (�restricted
securities�). However certain restricted securities that may be resold pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act may be considered liquid. Rule 144A permits certain
qualified institutional buyers to trade in privately placed securities not registered
under the Securities Act. Institutional markets for restricted securities have developed
as a result of Rule 144A, providing both readily ascertainable market values for Rule 144A
securities and the ability to liquidate these securities to satisfy redemption requests.
However, an insufficient number of qualified institutional buyers interested in purchasing
Rule 144A securities held by a Fund could adversely affect their marketability, causing
the Fund to sell securities at unfavorable prices. The Board of Trustees of the Trust has
delegated to the Adviser the day-to-day determination of the liquidity of a security
although it has retained oversight and ultimate responsibility for such determinations.
Although no definite quality criteria are used, the Board of Trustees has directed the
Adviser to consider such factors as (i) the nature of the market for a security (including
the institutional private resale markets); (ii) the terms of these securities or other
instruments allowing for the disposition to a third party or the issuer thereof (e.g.
certain repurchase obligations and demand instruments); (iii) the availability of market
quotations; and (iv) other permissible factors. 
��������Restricted
securities may be sold in privately negotiated or other exempt transactions or in a public
offering with respect to which a registration statement is in effect under the Securities
Act. When registration is required, a Fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the
registration expenses and considerable time may elapse between the decision to sell and
the sale date. If, during such period, adverse market conditions were to develop, the Fund
might obtain a less favorable price than the price which prevailed when it decided to
sell. Restricted securities for which there is no market will be valued by appraisal at
their fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under procedures established
by and under the general supervision and responsibility of the Trust�s Board of
Trustees. 
B-7 

��������Lending
of Portfolio Securities 
��������The
Micro Cap Fund may lend portfolio securities constituting up to 33 1/3% of its total
assets (as permitted by the 1940 Act) to unaffiliated broker-dealers, banks or other
recognized institutional borrowers of securities, provided that the borrower at all times
maintains cash, U.S. government securities or equivalent collateral or provides an
irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the Micro Cap Fund equal in value to at least
100% of the value of the securities loaned. During the time portfolio securities are on
loan, the borrower pays the Micro Cap Fund an amount equivalent to any dividends or
interest paid on such securities, and the Micro Cap Fund may receive an agreed-upon amount
of interest income from the borrower who delivered equivalent collateral or provided a
letter of credit. Loans are subject to termination at the option of the Micro Cap Fund or
the borrower. The Micro Cap Fund may pay reasonable administrative and custodial fees in
connection with a loan of portfolio securities and may pay a negotiated portion of the
interest earned on the cash or equivalent collateral to the borrower or placing broker.
The Micro Cap Fund does not have the right to vote securities on loan, but could terminate
the loan and regain the right to vote if that were considered important with respect to
the investment. 
��������The
primary risk in securities lending is a default by the borrower during a sharp rise in
price of the borrowed security resulting in a deficiency in the collateral posted by the
borrower. The Micro Cap Fund will seek to minimize this risk by requiring that the value
of the securities loaned be computed each day and additional collateral be furnished each
day if required. 
��������Borrowing 
��������Each
Fund is authorized to borrow money from banks as a temporary measure for extraordinary or
emergency purposes in amounts not in excess of 20% of the value of the Fund�s net
assets at the time of borrowing. For example, a Fund may borrow money to facilitate
management of the Fund�s portfolio by enabling the Fund to meet redemption requests
when the liquidation of portfolio investments would be inconvenient or disadvantageous. A
Fund will not purchase portfolio securities when outstanding borrowings exceed 5% of the
Fund�s total assets. As required by the 1940 Act, a Fund may only borrow from a bank
and must maintain continuous asset coverage (total assets, including assets acquired with
borrowed funds, less liabilities exclusive of borrowings) of 300% of all amounts borrowed.
If, at any time, the value of the Fund�s assets should fail to meet this 300%
coverage test, the Fund will reduce the amount of the Fund�s borrowings to the extent
necessary to meet this 300% coverage within three days (not including Saturdays, Sundays
and holidays). Maintenance of this percentage limitation may result in the sale of
portfolio securities at a time when investment considerations otherwise indicate that it
would be disadvantageous to do so. 
��������Money
Market Instruments 
��������Each
Fund may invest in cash and money market securities. A Fund may do so to �cover�
investment techniques, when taking a temporary defensive position or to have assets
available to pay expenses, satisfy redemption requests or take advantage of investment
opportunities. The money market securities in which the Funds invest include U.S. Treasury
Bills, commercial paper, commercial paper master notes and repurchase agreements. 
��������Each
Fund may invest in commercial paper or commercial paper master notes rated, at the time of
purchase, A-1 or A-2 by Standard & Poor�s Corporation or Prime-1 or Prime-2 by
Moody�s Investors Service, Inc. Commercial paper master notes are demand instruments
without a fixed maturity bearing interest at rates that are fixed to known lending rates
and automatically adjusted when such lending rates change. 
B-8 

��������Under
a repurchase agreement, a Fund purchases a debt security and simultaneously agrees to sell
the security back to the seller at a mutually agreed-upon future price and date, normally
one day or a few days later. The resale price is greater than the purchase price,
reflecting an agreed-upon market interest rate during the purchaser�s holding period.
While the maturities of the underlying securities in repurchase transactions may be more
than one year, the term of each repurchase agreement will always be less than one year.
The Fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with member banks of the Federal
Reserve system or primary dealers of U.S. government securities. The Adviser will monitor
the creditworthiness of each of the firms which is a party to a repurchase agreement with
the Fund. In the event of a default or bankruptcy by the seller, the Fund will liquidate
those securities (whose market value, including accrued interest, must be at least equal
to 100% of the dollar amount invested by the Fund in each repurchase agreement) held under
the applicable repurchase agreement, which securities constitute collateral for the
seller�s obligation to pay. However, liquidation could involve costs or delays and,
to the extent proceeds from the sale of these securities were less than the agreed-upon
repurchase price, the Fund would suffer a loss. The Fund also may experience difficulties
and incur certain costs in exercising its rights to the collateral and may lose the
interest the Fund expected to receive under the repurchase agreement. Repurchase
agreements usually are for short periods, such as one week or less, but may be longer. It
is the current policy of the Funds to treat repurchase agreements that do not mature
within seven days as illiquid for the purposes of their investments policies. 
��������Each
Fund may also invest in securities issued by other investment companies that invest in
high quality, short-term debt securities (i.e., money market instruments). In addition to
the advisory fees and other expenses each Fund bears directly in connection with its own
operations, as a shareholder of another investment company, the Fund would bear its pro
rata portion of the other investment company�s advisory fees and other expenses, and
such fees and other expenses will be borne indirectly by the Fund�s shareholders. 
��������Rights
and Warrants 
��������Each
Fund may purchase rights and warrants to purchase equity securities. Investments in rights
and warrants are pure speculation in that they have no voting rights, pay no dividends and
have no rights with respect to the assets of the corporation issuing them. Rights and
warrants basically are options to purchase equity securities at a specific price valid for
a specific period of time. They do not represent ownership of the securities, but only the
right to buy them. Rights and warrants differ from call options in that rights and
warrants are issued by the issuer of the security which may be purchased on their
exercise, whereas call options may be written or issued by anyone. The prices of rights
(if traded independently) and warrants do not necessarily move parallel to the prices of
the underlying securities. Rights and warrants involve the risk that a Fund could lose the
purchase value of the warrant if the warrant is not exercised prior to its expiration.
They also involve the risk that the effective price paid for the warrant added to the
subscription price of the related security may be greater than the value of the subscribed
security�s market price. 
B-9 

��������Derivatives 
��������The
Funds may invest in various derivatives. A derivative is a financial instrument which has
a value that is based on � or �derived from� � the values of other
assets, reference rates, or indexes. Both of the Funds may invest in derivatives for
hedging purposes. The Active Income Fund will also invest in derivatives for speculative
purposes. The Micro Cap Fund will not invest more than 15% of the value of its total
assets in derivative securities. The Active Income Fund is not subject to this limitation. 
��������Derivatives
may relate to a wide variety of underlying references, such as commodities, stocks, bonds,
interest rates, currency exchange rates and related indexes. Derivatives include futures
contracts and options on futures contracts (see discussion below), forward-commitment
transactions (see discussion below on �When Issued and Delayed-Delivery
Securities�), options on securities (see discussion below on �Options on
Securities�), caps, floors, collars, swap agreements (see discussion below on
�Swaps�), and other financial instruments. Some derivatives, such as futures
contracts and certain options, are traded on U.S. commodity and securities exchanges,
while other derivatives, such as swap agreements, are privately negotiated and entered
into in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. The risks associated with the use of
derivatives are different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with
investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. Derivatives are used
by some investors for speculative purposes. Derivatives also may be used for a variety of
purposes that do not constitute speculation, such as hedging, risk management, seeking to
stay fully invested, seeking to reduce transaction costs, seeking to simulate an
investment in equity or debt securities or other investments, seeking to add value by
using derivatives to more efficiently implement portfolio positions when derivatives are
favorably priced relative to equity or debt securities or other investments, and for other
purposes. 
��������Derivative
products are highly specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk
analyses different from those associated with stocks, bonds, and other traditional
investments. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying
instrument but also of the derivative itself, without the benefit of observing the
performance of the derivative under all possible market conditions. 
��������The
use of a derivative involves the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the
insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party to the contract (usually referred to as a
�counterparty�) or the failure of the counterparty to make required payments or
otherwise comply with the terms of the contract. Additionally, the use of credit
derivatives can result in losses if the Adviser does not correctly evaluate the
creditworthiness of the issuer on which the credit derivative is based. 
��������Derivatives
may be subject to liquidity risk, which exists when a particular derivative is difficult
to purchase or sell. If a derivative transaction is particularly large or if the relevant
market is illiquid (as is the case with many OTC derivatives), it may not be possible to
initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an advantageous time or price. 
��������Derivatives
may be subject to pricing or �basis� risk, which exists when a particular
derivative becomes extraordinarily expensive relative to historical prices or the prices
of corresponding cash market instruments. Under certain market conditions, it may not be
economically feasible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position in time to avoid a
loss or take advantage of an opportunity. 
B-10 

��������Because
many derivatives have a leverage or borrowing component, adverse changes in the value or
level of the underlying asset, reference rate, or index can result in a loss substantially
greater than the amount invested in the derivative itself. Certain derivatives have the
potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial investment. While
certain derivative transactions may be considered to constitute borrowing transactions,
such derivative transactions will not be considered to constitute the issuance of a
�senior security�, and therefore such transactions will not be subject to the
300% continuous asset coverage requirement otherwise applicable to borrowings, if a Fund
covers the transaction or segregates sufficient liquid assets in accordance with
applicable requirements. 
��������Like
most other investments, derivative instruments are subject to the risk that the market
value of the instrument will change in a way detrimental to a Fund�s interest. Each
Fund bears the risk that the Adviser will incorrectly forecast future market trends or the
values of assets, reference rates, indices, or other financial or economic factors in
establishing derivative positions for the Fund. If the Adviser attempts to use a
derivative as a hedge against, or as a substitute for, a portfolio investment, a Fund will
be exposed to the risk that the derivative will have or will develop imperfect or no
correlation with the portfolio investment. This could cause substantial losses for a Fund.
While hedging strategies involving derivative instruments can reduce the risk of loss,
they can also reduce the opportunity for gain or even result in losses by offsetting
favorable price movements in other investments. Many derivatives, in particular OTC
derivatives, are complex and often valued subjectively. Improper valuations can result in
increased cash payment requirements to counterparties or a loss of value to a Fund. 
��������Options
on Securities 
��������An
option is a legal contract that gives the buyer (who then becomes the holder) the right to
buy, in the case of a call, or sell, in the case of a put, a specified amount of the
underlying security at the option price at any time before the option expires. The buyer
of a call obtains, in exchange for a premium that is paid to the seller, or
�writer,� of the call, the right to purchase the underlying security. The buyer
of a put obtains the right to sell the underlying security to the writer of the put,
likewise in exchange for a premium. Options have standardized terms, including the
exercise price and expiration time; listed options are traded on national securities
exchanges that provide a secondary market in which holders or writers can close out their
positions by offsetting sales and purchases. The premium paid to a writer is not a down
payment; it is a nonrefundable payment from a buyer to a seller for the rights conveyed by
the option. A premium has two components: the intrinsic value and the time value. The
intrinsic value represents the difference between the current price of the securities and
the exercise price at which the securities will be sold pursuant to the terms of the
option. The time value is the sum of money investors are willing to pay for the option in
the hope that, at some time before expiration, it will increase in value because of a
change in the price of the underlying security. 
��������One
risk of any put or call that is held is that the put or call is a wasting asset. If it is
not sold or exercised prior to its expiration, it becomes worthless. The time value
component of the premium decreases as the option approaches expiration, and the holder may
lose all or a large part of the premium paid. In addition, there can be no guarantee that
a liquid secondary market will exist on a given exchange, in order for an option position
to be closed out. Furthermore, if trading is halted in an underlying security, the trading
of options is usually halted as well. In the event that an option cannot be traded, the
only alternative to the holder is to exercise the option. 
B-11 

��������Call
Options on Securities. When a Fund writes a call, it receives a premium and
agrees to sell the related investments to the purchaser of the call during the call period
(usually not more than nine months) at a fixed exercise price (which may differ from the
market price of the related investments) regardless of market price changes during the
call period. If the call is exercised, the Fund forgoes any gain from an increase in the
market price over the exercise price. 
��������To
terminate its obligation on a call which it has written, a Fund may purchase a call in a
�closing purchase transaction.� A profit or loss will be realized depending on
the amount of option transaction costs and whether the premium previously received is more
or less than the price of the call purchased. A profit may also be realized if the call
lapses unexercised, because a Fund retains the premium received. All call options written
by a Fund must be �covered.� For a call to be �covered�: (a) a Fund
must own the underlying security or have an absolute and immediate right to acquire that
security without payment of additional cash consideration; (b) a Fund must maintain cash
or liquid securities adequate to purchase the security; or (c) any combination of (a) or
(b). 
��������When
a Fund buys a call, it pays a premium and has the right to buy the related investments
from the seller of the call during the call period at a fixed exercise price. A Fund
benefits only if the market price of the related investment is above the call price plus
the premium paid during the call period and the call is either exercised or sold at a
profit. If the call is not exercised or sold (whether or not at a profit), it will become
worthless at its expiration date, and a Fund will lose its premium payment and the right
to purchase the related investment. 
��������Put
Options on Securities. When a Fund buys a put, it pays a premium and has
the right to sell the related investment to the seller of the put during the put period
(usually not more than nine months) at a fixed exercise price. Buying a protective put
permits a Fund to protect itself during the put period against a decline in the value of
the related investment below the exercise price by having the right to sell the investment
through the exercise of the put. 
��������When
a Fund writes a put option it receives a premium and has the same obligations to a
purchaser of such a put as are indicated above as its rights when it purchases such a put.
A profit or loss will be realized depending on the amount of option transaction costs and
whether the premium previously received is more or less than the put purchased in a
closing purchase transaction. A profit may also be realized if the put lapses unexercised,
because a Fund retains the premium received. All put options written by a Fund must be
�covered.� For a put to be �covered�, a Fund must maintain cash or
liquid securities equal to the option price. 
��������Futures
Contracts and Options Thereon 
��������The
Active Income Fund may purchase and write (sell) interest rate/debt futures contracts, and
may purchase put and call options and write call options on interest rate/debt futures
contracts. A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to take
delivery of) the specified commodity on the expiration date of the contract. An interest
rate/debt futures contract obligates the Active Income Fund to purchase or sell an amount
of a specific debt security at a future date at a specific price. It is the practice of
holders of futures contracts to close out their positions on or before the expiration date
by use of offsetting contract positions and physical delivery is thereby avoided. 
B-12 

��������A
futures contract is a commitment to buy or sell a specific product at a currently
determined market price, for delivery at a predetermined future date. The futures contract
is uniform as to quantity, quality and delivery time for a specified underlying product.
The commitment is executed in a designated contract market � a futures exchange
� that maintains facilities for continuous trading. The buyer and seller of the
futures contract are both required to make a deposit of cash or U.S. Treasury Bills with
their brokers equal to a varying specified percentage of the contract amount; the deposit
is known as initial margin. Since ownership of the underlying product is not being
transferred, the margin deposit is not a down payment; it is a security deposit to protect
against nonperformance of the contract. No credit is being extended, and no interest
expense accrues on the non-margined value of the contract. The contract is marked to
market every day, and the profits and losses resulting from the daily change are reflected
in the accounts of the buyer and seller of the contract. A profit in excess of the initial
deposit can be withdrawn, but a loss may require an additional payment, known as variation
margin, if the loss causes the equity in the account to fall below an established
maintenance level. The Funds will maintain cash or liquid securities sufficient to cover
their obligations under each futures contract into which they enter. 
��������Successful
use of interest rate/debt futures contracts and options on interest rate/debt futures
contracts by the Active Income Fund is subject to the Adviser�s ability to predict
correctly movements in the direction of the relevant market and, to the extent the
transaction is entered into for hedging purposes, to ascertain the appropriate correlation
between the transaction being hedged and the price movements of the futures contract. For
example, if the Active Income Fund uses futures to hedge against the possibility of a
decline in the market value of debt instruments held in its portfolio and the prices of
such securities instead increase, the Active Income Fund will lose part or all of the
benefit of the increased value of the securities which it has hedged because it will have
offsetting losses in its futures positions. Furthermore, if in such circumstances the
Active Income Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell securities to meet daily
variation margin requirements. The Active Income Fund may have to sell such securities at
a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. 
��������The
Micro Cap Fund may purchase and write (sell) stock index futures contracts as a substitute
for a comparable market position in the underlying securities, and may purchase put and
call options and write call options on stock index futures contracts. A stock index
futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to take) an amount of
cash equal to a specific dollar amount times the difference between the value of a
specific stock index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at
which the agreement is made. No physical delivery of the underlying stocks in the index is
made. 
��������When
a Fund purchases a put or call option on a futures contract, the Fund pays a premium for
the right to sell or purchase the underlying futures contract for a specified price upon
exercise at any time during the option period. By writing a call option on a futures
contract, the Fund receives a premium in return for granting to the purchaser of the
option the right to buy from the Fund the underlying futures contract for a specified
price upon exercise at any time during the option period. 
��������Some
futures and options strategies tend to hedge a Fund�s positions against price
fluctuations, while other strategies tend to increase market exposure. The extent of a
Fund�s loss from an unhedged short position in futures contracts or call options on
futures contracts is potentially unlimited. Each Fund may engage in related closing
transactions with respect to options on futures contracts. Each Fund will purchase or
write options only on futures contracts that are traded on a United States exchange or
board of trade. 
B-13 

��������The
Trust has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term �commodity pool
operator� under Section 4.5 of the regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act
promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Thus, the Trust is not subject to
registration or regulation as a pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act. 
��������When
a Fund purchases or sells a futures contract, the Fund �covers� its position. To
cover its position, the Fund may maintain with its custodian bank (and mark-to-market on a
daily basis) cash or liquid securities that, when added to any amounts deposited with a
futures commission merchant as margin, are equal to the market value of the futures
contract or otherwise cover its position. If the Fund continues to engage in the described
securities trading practices and so maintain cash or liquid securities, the maintained
cash or liquid securities will function as a practical limit on the amount of leverage
which the Fund may undertake and on the potential increase in the speculative character of
the Fund�s outstanding portfolio securities. Additionally, such maintained cash or
liquid securities will assure the availability of adequate funds to meet the obligations
of the Fund arising from such investment activities. 
��������Each
Fund may cover its long position in a futures contract by purchasing a put option on the
same futures contract with a strike price (i.e., an exercise price) as high or higher than
the price of the futures contract, or, if the strike price of the put is less than the
price of the futures contract, the Fund will maintain cash or liquid securities equal in
value to the difference between the strike price of the put and the price of the futures
contract. The Fund may also cover its long position in a futures contract by taking a
short position in the instruments underlying the futures contract, or by taking positions
in instruments the prices of which are expected to move relatively consistently with the
futures contract. The Fund may cover its short position in a futures contract by taking a
long position in the instruments underlying the futures contract, or by taking positions
in instruments the prices of which are expected to move relatively consistently with the
futures contract. 
��������Each
Fund may cover its sale of a call option on a futures contract by taking a long position
in the underlying futures contract at a price less than or equal to the strike price of
the call option, or, if the long position in the underlying futures contract is
established at a price greater than the strike price of the written call, the Fund will
maintain cash or liquid securities equal in value to the difference between the strike
price of the call and the price of the futures contract. Each Fund may also cover its sale
of a call option by taking positions in instruments the prices of which are expected to
move relatively consistently with the call option. 
��������Although
each Fund intends to sell futures contracts only if there is an active market for such
contracts, no assurance can be given that a liquid market will exist for any particular
contract at any particular time. Many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the
amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day.
Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made that
day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods during
the day. Futures contract prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading
days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions
and potentially subjecting a Fund to substantial losses. If trading is not possible, or a
Fund determines not to close a futures position in anticipation of adverse price
movements, the Fund will be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin. The
risk that a Fund will be unable to close out a futures position will be minimized by
entering into such transactions on a national exchange with an active and liquid secondary
market. 
B-14 

��������Special
Risks of Hedging Strategies 
��������Participation
in the options or futures markets involves investment risks and transactions costs to
which a Fund would not be subject absent the use of these strategies. In particular, the
loss from investing in futures contracts is potentially unlimited. If the Adviser�s
prediction of movements in the securities and interest rate markets is inaccurate, a Fund
could be in a worse position than if such strategies were not used. Risks inherent in the
use of options, futures contracts and options on futures contracts include: (1) imperfect
correlation between the price of options and futures contracts and options thereon and
movements in the prices of the securities being hedged; (2)�the fact that skills
needed to use these strategies are different from those needed to select portfolio
securities; and (3) the possible absence of a liquid secondary market for any particular
instrument at any time. 
��������Real
Estate Investment Trusts 
��������A
real estate investment trust (�REIT�) is a corporation, or a business trust that
would otherwise be taxed as a corporation, which meets the definitional requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the �Code�). The Code permits a
qualifying REIT to deduct dividends paid, thereby effectively eliminating corporate level
federal income tax and making the REIT a pass-through vehicle for federal income tax
purposes. To meet the definitional requirements of the Code, a REIT must, among other
things, invest substantially all of its assets in interests in real estate (including
mortgages and other REITs) or cash and government securities, derive most of its income
from rents from real property or interest on loans secured by mortgages on real property,
and distribute to shareholders annually a substantial portion of its otherwise taxable
income. 
��������REITs
are characterized as equity REITs, mortgage REITs, and hybrid REITs. Equity REITs, which
may include operating or finance companies, own real estate directly and the value of, and
income earned by, the REITs depend upon the income of the underlying properties and the
rental income they earn. Equity REITs also can realize capital gains (or losses) by
selling properties that have appreciated (or depreciated) in value. Mortgage REITs can
make construction, development or long-term mortgage loans and are sensitive to the credit
quality of the borrower. Mortgage REITs derive their income from interest payments on such
loans. Hybrid REITs combine the characteristics of both equity and mortgage REITs,
generally by holding both ownership interests and mortgage interests in real estate. The
value of securities issued by REITs are affected by tax and regulatory requirements and by
perceptions of management skill. They also are subject to heavy cash flow dependency,
defaults by borrowers or tenants, self-liquidation and the possibility of failing to
qualify for tax-free status under the Code or to maintain exemption from the 1940 Act. 
��������Foreign
Securities 
��������Each
of the Funds may invest in securities of foreign issuers. Each of the Funds may also hold
securities of U.S. and foreign issuers in the form of American Depository Receipts
(�ADRs�) or American Depository Shares (�ADSs�), and they may each
invest in securities of foreign issuers traded directly in the U.S. securities markets.
Investments in foreign securities involve special risks and considerations that are not
present when the Funds invests in domestic securities. As an operating policy, the Micro
Cap Fund may only purchase securities of foreign issuers and ADRs and ADSs up to a maximum
of 15% of the value of its total net assets, and the Active Income Fund may invest up to
15% of its total assets in bonds issued by foreign issuers that are U.S.
dollar-denominated and up to 5% of its total assets in bonds of foreign issuers
denominated in foreign currencies. 
B-15 

��������The
Active Income Fund may invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by one or more foreign
governments or any of their political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities that are
determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality to the other obligations in which
the Active Income Fund may invest. Such securities also include debt obligations of
supranational entities. Supranational entities include international organizations
designated or supported by governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or
development and international banking institutions and related government agencies.
Examples include the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World
Bank), the European Coal and Steel Community, the Asian Development Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank. 
��������The
value of the Funds� foreign investments may be significantly affected by changes in
currency exchange rates, and the Funds may incur certain costs in converting securities
denominated in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. In many countries, there is less
publicly available information about issuers than is available in the reports and ratings
published about companies in the United States. Additionally, foreign companies are not
subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards. Dividends and
interest on foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes which would
reduce the Funds� income without providing a tax credit for the Funds�
shareholders. Although the Funds intend to invest in securities of foreign issuers
domiciled in nations which the Adviser considers as having stable and friendly
governments, there is a possibility of expropriation, confiscatory taxation, currency
blockage or political or social instability which could affect investments in those
nations. 
��������Limitations
on Options and Futures 
��������Transactions
in options by a Fund will be subject to limitations established by each of the exchanges
governing the maximum number of options which may be written or held by a single investor
or group of investors acting in concert, regardless of whether the options are written or
held on the same or different exchanges or are written or held in one or more accounts or
through one or more brokers. Thus, the number of options which a Fund may write or hold
may be affected by options written or held by other investment advisory clients of the
Adviser and its affiliates. Position limits also apply to futures contracts. An exchange
may order the liquidations of positions found to be in excess of these limits, and it may
impose certain sanctions. 
Non-Principal Investment
Strategies and Risks Specific to the Active Income Fund 
��������Convertible
Securities 
��������The
Active Income Fund may invest in convertible debt securities. The Active Income Fund may
also invest in common or preferred stock as a means of realizing the economic value
associated with owning convertible securities. Convertible securities are bonds or
preferred stocks that may be converted (exchanged) into common stock of the issuing
company within a certain period of time, for a specified number of shares. 
B-16 

��������Duration
and Portfolio Maturity 
��������The
Active Income Fund invests without regard to maturity or duration limitations. As a
measure of a fixed-income security�s cash flow, duration is an alternative to the
concept of �term to maturity� in assessing the price volatility associated with
changes in interest rates. Generally, the longer the duration, the more volatility an
investor should expect. For example, the market price of a bond with a duration of three
years would be expected to decline 3% if interest rates rose 1%. Conversely, the market
price of the same bond would be expected to increase 3% if interest rates fell 1%. The
market price of a bond with a duration of six years would be expected to increase or
decline twice as much as the market price of a bond with a three-year duration. Duration
is a way of measuring a security�s maturity in terms of the average time required to
receive the present value of all interest and principal payments as opposed to its term to
maturity. The maturity of a security measures only the time until final payment is due; it
does not take account of the pattern of a security�s cash flows over time, which
would include how cash flow is affected by prepayments and by changes in interest rates.
Incorporating a security�s yield, coupon interest payments, final maturity and option
features into one measure, duration is computed by determining the weighted average
maturity of a bond�s cash flows, where the present values of the cash flows serve as
weights. In computing the duration of the Active Income Fund, the Adviser will estimate
the duration of obligations that are subject to features such as prepayment or redemption
by the issuer, put options retained by the investor or other imbedded options, taking into
account the influence of interest rates on prepayments and coupon flows. The Adviser will
adjust the duration and maturity of the Active Income Fund�s portfolio based on the
Adviser�s interest rate outlook. 
��������Swaps 
��������A
swap agreement is a derivative that is subject to the risks discussed above in
�Derivatives�. A swap agreement is an agreement between two parties
(counterparties) to exchange payments at specified dates (periodic payment dates) on the
basis of a specified amount (notional amount) with the payments calculated with reference
to a specified asset, reference rate, or index. 
��������Examples
of swap agreements include, but are not limited to, interest rate swaps, credit default
swaps, equity swaps, commodity swaps, foreign currency swaps, index swaps, and total
return swaps. Forms of swap agreements include interest rate caps, under which, in return
for a premium, one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates
exceed a specified rate or �cap�; interest rate floors, under which, in return
for a premium, one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates
fall below a specified level or �floor�; and interest rate collars, under which
a party sells a cap and purchases a floor or vice versa in an attempt to protect itself
against interest rate movements exceeding given minimum levels. Most swap agreements
provide that when the periodic payment dates for both parties are the same, payments are
netted, and only the net amount is paid to the counterparty entitled to receive the net
payment. Consequently, the Active Income Fund�s current obligations (or rights) under
a swap agreement will generally be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received
under the agreement, based on the relative values of the positions held by each
counterparty. Swap agreements allow for a wide variety of transactions. For example, fixed
rate payments may be exchanged for floating rate payments; U.S. dollar-denominated
payments may be exchanged for payments denominated in a different currency; and payments
tied to the price of one asset, reference rate, or index may be exchanged for payments
tied to the price of another asset, reference rate, or index. 
B-17 

��������An
option on a swap agreement, also called a �swaption,� is an option that gives
the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a swap on a future date in
exchange for paying a market-based �premium.� A receiver swaption gives the
owner the right to receive the total return of a specified asset, reference rate, or
index. A payer swaption gives the owner the right to pay the total return of a specified
asset, reference rate, or index. Swaptions also include options that allow an existing
swap to be terminated or extended by one of the counterparties. 
��������The
swaps market is largely unregulated. It is possible that developments in the swaps market,
including potential government regulation, could adversely affect the Active Income
Fund�s ability to terminate existing swap agreements or to realize amounts to be
received under such agreements. 
��������Reverse
Repurchase Agreements 
��������The
Active Income Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements. Reverse repurchase
agreements are considered to be borrowings under the 1940 Act, and as such are subject to
the investment limitations discussed in the section entitled �Borrowing.� Under
a reverse repurchase agreement, the Active Income Fund sells portfolio securities and
agrees to repurchase them at an agreed-upon future date and price. When the Active Income
Fund enters into a reverse repurchase agreement, it will maintain cash or liquid
securities having a value equal to or greater than the repurchase price (including accrued
interest). Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of the
securities sold by the Active Income Fund may decline below the price of the securities it
is obligated to repurchase. 
��������When
Issued and Delayed-Delivery Securities 
��������To
ensure the availability of suitable securities for its portfolio, the Active Income Fund
may purchase when-issued or delayed delivery securities. When-issued transactions arise
when securities are purchased by the Active Income Fund with payment and delivery taking
place in the future in order to secure what is considered to be an advantageous price and
yield to the Fund at the time of entering into the transaction. When-issued securities
represent securities that have been authorized but not yet issued. The Active Income Fund
may also purchase securities on a forward commitment or delayed delivery basis. In a
forward commitment transaction, the Active Income Fund contracts to purchase securities
for a fixed price at a future date beyond customary settlement time. The Active Income
Fund is required to hold and maintain until the settlement date, cash or other liquid
assets in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase price. Alternatively, the Active
Income Fund may enter into offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other securities
that it owns. The purchase of securities on a when-issued or forward commitment basis
involves a risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased declines prior to the
settlement date. 
��������U.S.
Government Securities 
��������The
Active Income Fund may invest in a variety of U.S. Treasury obligations, including bills,
notes and bonds. These obligations differ only in terms of their interest rates,
maturities and time of issuance. The Active Income Fund may also invest in other
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies and
instrumentalities. 
B-18 

��������Obligations
of certain agencies and instrumentalities, such as the Government National Mortgage
Association (�Ginnie Mae�), are supported by the full faith and credit of the
U.S. Treasury. Others, such as those of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, are
supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury; and others, such as
those of the Federal National Mortgage Association (�Fannie Mae�), are supported
by the discretionary authority of the U.S. government to purchase the agency�s
obligations; still others, such as those of the Student Loan Marketing Association
(�Sallie Mae�) are supported only by the credit of the agency or instrumentality
that issues them. There is no guarantee that the U.S. Government will provide financial
support to its agencies or instrumentalities, now or in the future, if it is not obligated
to do so by law. 
��������Inflation-Indexed
Bonds 
��������The
Active Income Fund may invest in inflation-indexed bonds, which are fixed-income
securities whose value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation. Two
structures are common. The U.S. Treasury and some other issuers utilize a structure that
accrues inflation into the principal value of the bond. Most other issuers pay out the
inflation accruals as part of a semiannual coupon. 
��������Inflation-indexed
securities issued by the U.S. Treasury have varying maturities and pay interest on a
semi-annual basis equal to a fixed percentage of the inflation-adjusted principal amount.
If the periodic adjustment rate measuring inflation falls, the principal value of
inflation-indexed bonds will be adjusted downward, and consequently the interest payable
on these securities (calculated with respect to a smaller principal amount) will be
reduced. Repayment of the original bond principal upon maturity (as adjusted for
inflation) is guaranteed in the case of U.S. Treasury inflation-indexed bonds, even during
a period of deflation. However, the current market value of the bonds is not guaranteed
and will fluctuate. The Active Income Fund also may invest in other inflation-related
bonds that may or may not provide a similar guarantee. If a guarantee of principal is not
provided, the adjusted principal value of the bond repaid at maturity may be less than the
original principal amount. 
��������The
value of inflation-indexed bonds is expected to change in response to changes in real
interest rates. Real interest rates in turn are tied to the relationship between nominal
interest rates and the rate of inflation. Therefore, if the rate of inflation rises at a
faster rate than nominal interest rates, real interest rates might decline, leading to an
increase in value of inflation-indexed bonds. In contrast, if nominal interest rates
increase at a faster rate than inflation, real interest rates might rise, leading to a
decrease in value of inflation-indexed bonds. Any increase in the principal amount of an
inflation-indexed bond will be considered taxable ordinary income, even though investors
do not receive their principal until maturity. 
��������While
these securities are expected to be protected from long-term inflationary trends,
short-term increases in inflation may lead to a decline in value. If interest rates rise
due to reasons other than inflation (for example, due to changes in currency exchange
rates), investors in these securities may not be protected to the extent that the increase
is not reflected in the bond�s inflation measure. 
B-19 

��������The
periodic adjustment of U.S. inflation-indexed bonds is tied to the Consumer Price Index
for Urban Consumers (�CPI-U�), which is calculated monthly by the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics. The CPI-U is a measurement of changes in the cost of living, made up of
components such as housing, food, transportation and energy. Inflation-indexed bonds
issued by a foreign government are generally adjusted to reflect a comparable inflation
index calculated by that government. There can be no assurance that the CPI-U or any
foreign inflation index will accurately measure the real rate of inflation in the prices
of goods and services. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the rate of inflation in a
foreign country will be correlated to the rate of inflation in the United States. 
��������Mortgage-Backed
Securities and Other Asset-Backed Securities 
��������The
Active Income Fund may invest in mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities
(i.e., securities backed by credit card receivables, automobile loans or other
assets). Mortgage-backed securities are securities that directly or indirectly represent a
participation in, or are secured by and payable from, mortgage loans secured by real
property. Mortgage-backed securities include: (1)�Government Agency Mortgage-Backed
Securities; (2)�Privately-Issued Mortgage-Backed Securities; and
(3)�collateralized mortgage obligations and multiclass pass-through securities. 
��������Government
Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities. Mortgage-backed securities
include Government Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities, which represent participation
interests in pools of residential mortgage loans originated by United States governmental
or private lenders and guaranteed, to the extent provided in such securities, by the
United States Government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities. Such securities,
with the exception of collateralized mortgage obligations, are ownership interests in the
underlying mortgage loans and provide for monthly payments that are a
�pass-through� of the monthly interest and principal payments (including any
prepayments) made by the individual borrowers on the pooled mortgage loans, net of any
fees paid to the guarantor of such securities and the servicer of the underlying mortgage
loans. 
��������The
Government Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities in which the Active Income Fund may invest
will include those issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation (�Freddie Mac�). As more fully described below, these
securities may include collateralized mortgage obligations, multiclass pass-through
securities and stripped Mortgage-Backed Securities. 
��������Ginnie
Mae Certificates. Ginnie Mae is a wholly-owned corporate instrumentality of the
United States within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The National Housing
Act of 1934, as amended (the �Housing Act�), authorizes Ginnie Mae to guarantee
the timely payment of the principal of and interest on certificates that are based on and
backed by a pool of mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration Act, or
Title�V of the Housing Act of 1949, or guaranteed by the Veterans�
Administration under the Servicemen�s Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended, or by
pools of other eligible mortgage loans. The Housing Act provides that the full faith and
credit of the United States Government is pledged to the payment of all amounts that may
be required to be paid under any guarantee. To meet its obligations under such guarantee,
Ginnie Mae is authorized to borrow from the U.S. Treasury with no limitations as to
amount. 
B-20 

��������Fannie
Mae Certificates. Fannie Mae is a federally chartered and privately owned
corporation organized and existing under the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter
Act. Fannie Mae was originally established in 1938 as a United States Government agency to
provide supplemental liquidity to the mortgage market and was transformed into a
shareholder owned and privately managed corporation by legislation enacted in 1968. Fannie
Mae provides funds to the mortgage market primarily by purchasing home mortgage loans from
local lenders, thereby replenishing their funds for additional lending. Fannie Mae
acquires funds to purchase home mortgage loans from many capital market investors that
ordinarily may not invest in mortgage loans directly, thereby expanding the total amount
of funds available for housing. 
��������Each
Fannie Mae Certificate entitles the registered holder thereof to receive amounts
representing such holder�s pro rata interest in scheduled principal payments and
interest payments (at such Fannie Mae Certificate�s pass-through rate, which is net
of any servicing and guarantee fees on the underlying mortgage loans), and any principal
prepayments, on the mortgage loans in the pool represented by such Fannie Mae Certificate
and such holder�s proportionate interest in the full principal amount of any
foreclosed or otherwise finally liquidated mortgage loan. The full and timely payment of
principal of and interest on each Fannie Mae Certificate will be guaranteed by Fannie Mae,
which guarantee is not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
Government. 
��������Freddie
Mac Certificates. Freddie Mac is a corporate instrumentality of the United States
created pursuant to the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970, as amended (the �FHLMC
Act�). Freddie Mac was established primarily for the purpose of increasing the
availability of mortgage credit for the financing of needed housing. The principal
activity of Freddie Mac currently consists of the purchase of first lien, conventional,
residential mortgage loans and participation interests in such mortgage loans and the
resale of the mortgage loans so purchased in the form of mortgage securities, primarily
Freddie Mac Certificates. 
��������Freddie
Mac guarantees to each registered holder of a Freddie Mac Certificate the timely payment
of interest at the rate provided for by such Freddie Mac Certificate, whether or not
received. Freddie Mac also guarantees to each registered holder of a Freddie Mac
Certificate ultimate collection of all principal of the related mortgage loans, without
any offset or deduction, but, generally, does not guarantee the timely payment of
scheduled principal. Freddie Mac may remit the amount due on account of its guarantee of
collection of principal at any time after default on an underlying mortgage loan, but not
later than 30 days following (i)�foreclosure sale, (ii)�payment of claim by any
mortgage insurer, or (iii)�the expiration of any right of redemption, whichever
occurs later, but in any event no later than one year after demand has been made upon the
mortgagor for accelerated payment of principal. The obligations of Freddie Mac under its
guarantee are obligations solely of Freddie Mac and are not backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States Government. 
��������Privately-Issued
Mortgage-Backed Securities>. Privately-Issued Mortgage-Backed
Securities are issued by private issuers and represent an interest in or are
collateralized by (i)�Mortgage-Backed Securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
Government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities (�Privately-Issued Agency
Mortgage-Backed Securities�), or (ii)�whole mortgage loans or non-Agency
collateralized Mortgage-Backed Securities (�Privately-Issued Non-Agency
Mortgage-Backed Securities�). These securities are structured similarly to the Ginnie
Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through securities described above and are
issued by originators of and investors in mortgage loans, including savings and loan
associations, mortgage banks, commercial banks, investment banks and special purpose
subsidiaries of the foregoing. Privately-Issued Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities usually
are backed by a pool of Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Certificates.
Privately-Issued Non-Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities usually are backed by a pool of
conventional fixed rate or adjustable rate mortgage loans that are not guaranteed by an
entity having the credit status of Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and generally
are structured with one or more types of credit enhancement. As more fully described
below, these securities may include collateralized mortgage obligations and, multiclass
pass-through securities. 
B-21 

��������The
Active Income Fund may invest in subordinated Privately-Issued Non-Agency Mortgage-Backed
Securities (�Subordinated Securities�). Subordinated Securities have no
governmental guarantee, and are subordinated in some manner as to the payment of principal
and/or interest to the holders of more senior Privately-Issued Non-Agency Mortgage-Backed
Securities. The holders of Subordinated Securities typically are compensated with a higher
stated yield than are the holders of more senior Privately-Issued Non-Agency
Mortgage-Backed Securities. On the other hand, Subordinated Securities typically subject
the holder to greater risk than senior Privately-Issued Non-Agency Mortgage-Backed
Securities and tend to be rated in a lower rating category, and frequently a substantially
lower rating category, than the senior Privately-Issued Non-Agency Mortgage-Backed
Securities. Subordinated Securities generally are likely to be more sensitive to changes
in prepayment and interest rates and the market for such securities may be less liquid
than is the case for traditional fixed-income securities and senior Privately-Issued
Non-Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities. 
��������Collateralized
Mortgage Obligations and Multiclass Pass-Through Securities.
Mortgage-Backed Securities include collateralized mortgage obligations or
�CMOs,� which are debt obligations collateralized by mortgage loans or mortgage
pass-through securities. Typically, CMOs are collateralized by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac Certificates, but also may be collateralized by other Mortgage-Backed
Securities or whole loans (such collateral collectively hereinafter referred to as
�Mortgage Assets�). CMOs include multiclass pass-through securities, which can
be equity interests in a trust composed of mortgage assets. Payments of principal of and
interest on the Mortgage Assets, and any reinvestment income thereon, provide the funds to
pay debt service on the CMOs or make scheduled distributions on the multiclass
pass-through securities. CMOs may be issued by agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S.
Government, or by private originators of, or investors in, mortgage loans, including
savings and loan associations, mortgage banks, commercial banks, investment banks and
special purpose subsidiaries of the foregoing. The issuer of a series of CMOs may elect to
be treated as a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit. 
��������In
a CMO, a series of bonds or certificates is issued in multiple classes. Each class of
CMOs, often referred to as a �tranche,� is issued at a specific fixed or
floating coupon rate and has a stated maturity or final distribution date. Principal
prepayments on the Mortgage Assets may cause the CMOs to be retired substantially earlier
than their stated maturities or final distribution dates. Interest is paid or accrues on
classes of the CMOs on a monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis. The principal of and
interest on the Mortgage Assets may be allocated among the several classes of a CMO series
in innumerable ways, some of which bear substantially more risk than others. In
particular, certain classes of CMOs and other types of mortgage pass-through securities,
including interest only classes, principal only classes, inverse floaters, Z or accrual
classes and companion classes, are designed to be highly sensitive to changes in
prepayment and interest rates and can subject the holder to extreme reductions of yield
and loss of principal. The Active Income Fund may invest in such high-risk, derivative
Mortgage-Backed Securities. 
B-22 

��������Stripped
Mortgage-Backed Securities. The Active Income Fund may invest in stripped
Mortgage-Backed Securities issued by the U.S. Government (�SMBS�). SMBS are
usually structured with two classes that receive different proportions of the interest and
principal distributions from a pool of Mortgage Assets. A common type of SMBS will have
one class receiving all of the interest from the Mortgage Assets, while the other class
will receive all of the principal. However, in some instances, one class will receive some
of the interest and most of the principal while the other class will receive most of the
interest and the remainder of the principal. If the underlying Mortgage Assets experience
greater than anticipated prepayments of principal, the Active Income Fund may fail to
fully recover its initial investment in these securities. The market value of the class
consisting entirely of principal payments generally is unusually volatile in response to
changes in interest rates. The yield on a class of SMBS that receives all or most of the
interest from Mortgage Assets are generally higher than prevailing market yields on other
Mortgage-Backed Securities because their cash flow patterns are more volatile and there is
a greater risk that the initial investment will not be fully recouped. 
��������Adjustable-Rate
Mortgage Loans. Certain mortgage loans underlying the Mortgage-Backed
Securities in which the Active Income Fund may invest will be adjustable rate mortgage
loans (�ARMs�). ARMs eligible for inclusion in a mortgage pool will generally
provide for a fixed initial mortgage interest rate for a specified period of time.
Thereafter, the interest rates (the �Mortgage Interest Rates�) may be subject to
periodic adjustment based on changes in the applicable index rate (the �Index
Rate�). The adjusted rate would be equal to the Index Rate plus a gross margin, which
is a fixed percentage spread over the Index Rate established for each ARM at the time of
its origination. 
��������There
are various types of indices which provide the basis for rate adjustments on ARMS.
Commonly utilized indices include the one-year, three-year and five-year constant maturity
Treasury rates, the three-month Treasury Bill rate, the 180-day Treasury bill rate, rates
on longer-term Treasury securities, the 11th District Federal Home Loan Bank Cost of
Funds, the National Median Cost of Funds, the one-month, three-month, six-month or one
year LIBOR, the prime rate of a specific bank, or commercial paper rates. Some indices,
such as the one-year constant maturity Treasury rate, closely mirror changes in market
interest rate levels. Others, such as the 11th District Federal Home Loan Bank
Cost of Funds index, tend to lag behind changes in market rate levels and tend to be
somewhat less volatile. The degree of volatility in the market value of the Active Income
Fund�s portfolio and therefore in the NAV of the Active Income Fund�s shares
will be a function of the length of the interest rate reset periods and the degree of
volatility in the applicable indices. 
��������Adjustable
interest rates can cause payment increases that some mortgagors may find difficult to
make. However, certain ARMs may provide that the Mortgage Interest Rate may not be
adjusted to a rate above an applicable lifetime maximum rate or below an applicable
lifetime minimum rate for such ARMs. Certain ARMs may also be subject to limitations on
the maximum amount by which the Mortgage Interest Rate may adjust for any single
adjustment period (the �Maximum Adjustment�). Other ARMs (�Negatively
Amortizing ARMs�) may provide instead or as well for limitations on changes in the
monthly payment on such ARMs. Limitations on monthly payments can result in monthly
payments which are greater or less than the amount necessary to amortize a Negatively
Amortizing ARM by its maturity at the Mortgage Interest Rate in effect in any particular
month. In the event that a monthly payment is not sufficient to pay the interest accruing
on a Negatively Amortizing ARM, any such excess interest is added to the principal balance
of the loan, causing negative amortization, and is repaid through future monthly payments.
It may take borrowers under Negatively Amortizing ARMs longer periods of time to achieve
equity and may increase the likelihood of default by such borrowers. In the event that a
monthly payment exceeds the sum of the interest accrued at the applicable Mortgage
Interest Rate and the principal payment which would have been necessary to amortize the
outstanding principal balance over the remaining term of the loan, the excess (or
�accelerated amortization�) further reduces the principal balance of the ARM.
Negatively Amortizing ARMs do not provide for the extension of their original maturity to
accommodate changes in their Mortgage Interest Rate. As a result, unless there is a
periodic recalculation of the payment amount (which there generally is), the final payment
may be substantially larger than the other payments. These limitations on periodic
increases in interest rates and on changes in monthly payments protect borrowers from
unlimited interest rate and payment increases. 
B-23 

��������Asset-Backed
Securities . Asset-backed securities may involve certain risks that are not
presented by Mortgage-Backed Securities arising primarily from the nature of the
underlying assets (i.e., credit card and automobile loan receivables as opposed to real
estate mortgages). Non-mortgage asset-backed securities do not have the benefit of the
same security interest in the collateral as Mortgage-Backed Securities. Credit card
receivables are generally unsecured and the debtors are entitled to the protection of a
number of state and federal consumer credit laws, many of which have given debtors the
right to reduce the balance due on the credit cards. Most issuers of automobile
receivables permit the servicers to retain possession of the underlying obligations. If
the servicer were to sell these obligations to another party, there is the risk that the
purchaser would acquire an interest superior to that of the holders of related automobile
receivables. In addition, because of the large number of vehicles involved in a typical
issuance and technical requirements under state laws, the trustee for the holders of the
automobile receivables may not have an effective security interest in all of the
obligations backing such receivables. Therefore, there is a possibility that payments on
the receivables together with recoveries on repossessed collateral may not, in some cases,
be able to support payments on these securities. 
��������Asset-backed
securities may be subject to greater risk of default during periods of economic downturn
than other instruments. Also, while the secondary market for asset-backed securities is
ordinarily quite liquid, in times of financial stress the secondary market may not be as
liquid as the market for other types of securities, which could cause the Active Income
Fund to experience difficulty in valuing or liquidating such securities. 
��������Miscellaneous.  The
yield characteristics of Mortgage-Backed Securities differ from traditional
  debt securities. Among the major differences are that interest and principal
  payments are made more frequently, usually monthly, and that principal may be
  prepaid at any time because the underlying mortgage loans generally may be
  prepaid at any time. As a result, if the Active Income Fund purchases such a
  security at a premium, a prepayment rate that is faster than expected will
  reduce yield to maturity, while a prepayment rate that is slower than expected
  will have the opposite effect of increasing yield to maturity. Conversely, if
  the Active Income Fund purchases these securities at a discount, faster than
  expected prepayments will increase, while slower than expected prepayments will
  reduce, yield to maturity. Certain classes of CMOs and other types of mortgage
  pass-through securities, including those whose interest rates fluctuate based
on  multiples of a stated index, are designed to be highly sensitive to changes
in  prepayment and interest rates and can subject the holders thereof to extreme
  reductions of yield and possibly loss of principal.  
B-24 

��������Prepayments
on a pool of mortgage loans are influenced by a variety of economic, geographic, social
and other factors, including changes in the mortgagors� housing needs, job transfers,
unemployment, mortgagors� net equity in the mortgaged properties and servicing
decisions. Generally, however, prepayments on fixed rate mortgage loans will increase
during a period of falling interest rates and decrease during a period of rising interest
rates. Accordingly, amounts available for reinvestment by the Active Income Fund are
likely to be greater during a period of declining interest rates and, as a result, likely
to be reinvested at lower interest rates than during a period of rising interest rates.
Mortgage-Backed Securities may decrease in value as a result of increases in interest
rates and may benefit less than other fixed income securities from declining interest
rates because of the risk of prepayment. 
��������No
assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the market for certain Mortgage-Backed
Securities, such as CMOs and multiclass pass-through securities. Determination as to the
liquidity of such securities will be made in accordance with guidelines established by the
Trust�s Board of Trustees. In accordance with such guidelines, the Adviser will
monitor the Active Income Fund�s investments in such securities with particular
regard to trading activity, availability of reliable price information and other relevant
information. 
��������Mortgage
Dollar Rolls 
��������The
Active Income Fund may enter into mortgage �dollar rolls� in which the Active
Income Fund sells Mortgage-Backed Securities for delivery in the current month and
simultaneously contracts to repurchase substantially similar (same type, coupon and
maturity) securities on a specified future date. During the roll period, the Active Income
Fund foregoes principal and interest paid on the Mortgage-Backed Securities. The Active
Income Fund is compensated by the difference between the current sales price and the lower
forward price for the future purchase (often referred to as the �drop�) as well
as by the interest earned on the cash proceeds of the initial sale. A �covered
roll� is a dollar roll for which there is an offsetting cash or liquid security
position. The Active Income Fund will only enter into covered rolls. Covered rolls are not
treated as a borrowing or other senior security and will be excluded from the calculation
of the Active Income Funds� borrowings and other senior securities. 
��������Foreign
Currency Transactions 
��������The
Active Income Fund may engage in foreign currency transactions on a spot (cash) basis at
the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into
contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies at a future date (�forward foreign
currency� contracts or �forward� contracts). The Active Income Fund may
enter into foreign currency transactions for any purpose consistent with the Fund�s
investment objectives, such as seeking opportunities for income and capital gains. 
��������A
forward foreign currency contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specific
currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the
contract agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. These
contracts are principally traded in the inter-bank market conducted directly between
currency traders (usually large commercial banks) and their customers. A forward contract
generally has no deposit requirement and no commissions are charged at any stage for
trades. 
B-25 

��������Although
the Active Income Fund values its assets daily in terms of U.S. dollars, it does not
intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars on a daily basis.
The Active Income Fund will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the
costs of currency conversion. Although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for
conversion, they realize a profit based on the difference (the �spread�) between
the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies. Thus, a dealer may
offer to sell a foreign currency to the Active Income Fund at one rate, while offering a
lesser rate of exchange should the Active Income Fund desire to resell that currency to
the dealer. 
��������The
Active Income Fund may purchase and sell currency futures and purchase and write currency
options to increase or decrease its exposure to different foreign currencies. The uses and
risks of currency options and futures are similar to options and futures relating to
securities or indices, as discussed above. Currency futures contracts are similar to
forward foreign currency contracts, except that they are traded on exchanges (and have
margin requirements) and are standardized as to contract size and delivery date. Most
currency futures contracts call for payment or delivery in U.S. dollars. The underlying
instrument of a currency option may be a foreign currency, which generally is purchased or
delivered in exchange for U.S. dollars, or may be a futures contract. The purchaser of a
currency call obtains the right to purchase the underlying currency, and the purchaser of
a currency put obtains the right to sell the underlying currency. 
��������Currency
futures and options values can be expected to correlate with exchange rates, but may not
reflect other factors that affect the value of the Active Income Fund�s investments.
A currency hedge, for example, should protect a Yen-dominated security from a decline in
the Yen, but will not protect the Active Income Fund against a price decline resulting
from deterioration in the issuer�s creditworthiness. In hedging transactions, the
value of the Active Income Fund�s foreign-denominated investments may change in
response to many factors other than exchange rates, in which case it may not be possible
to match the amount of currency options and futures to the value of the Active Income
Fund�s investments exactly over time. 
PORTFOLIO TURNOVER 
��������The
portfolio turnover rate of the Micro Cap Fund may vary significantly from year to year,
but as indicated in the Prospectus, it is anticipated, though not assured, that the annual
portfolio turnover rate of the Fund will not significantly exceed 100%. A turnover rate of
100% would result in higher transaction costs (such as brokerage commissions or markups or
markdowns), which the Micro Cap Fund would have to pay, and would increase realized gains
(or losses) to investors, which would likely lower the Micro Cap Fund�s after-tax
performance. 
��������The
Active Income Fund will engage in short-term trading, which will likely result in the
Active Income Fund�s portfolio turnover exceeding 100% per year. This will produce
higher transaction costs (such as brokerage commissions or markups or markdowns), which
the Active Income Fund must pay, and will increase realized gains (or losses) to
investors, which may lower the Active Income Fund�s after-tax performance. 
B-26 

DISCLOSURE OF
PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS 
��������The
Funds maintain written policies and procedures (as described below) regarding the
disclosure of their portfolio holdings to ensure that disclosure of information about
portfolio securities is in the best interests of the Funds� shareholders. The
Funds� Chief Compliance Officer will report annually to the Board of Trustees with
respect to compliance with the portfolio holdings disclosure procedures described herein. 
��������The
officers of the Funds receive reports on a regular basis as to any purchases and
redemptions of shares of the Funds and review these reports to determine if there is any
unusual trading in shares of the Funds. The officers of the Funds will report to the Board
of Trustees any such unusual trading in shares of the Funds. 
��������There
may be instances where the interests of the shareholders of the Funds respecting the
disclosure of information about portfolio securities may conflict with the interests of
the Adviser or an affiliated person of the Funds. In such situations, the Board of
Trustees will be afforded the opportunity to determine whether or not to allow such
disclosure. The Funds do not receive any compensation for providing information about
their portfolio holdings. 
��������Fund
Service Providers 
��������The
Funds have entered into arrangements with certain third party service providers for
services that require these groups to have access to the Funds� portfolio holdings.
As a result of the ongoing services that these service providers provide, they will
receive portfolio holdings information prior to and more frequently than the public
disclosure of such information. In each case, the Funds� Board of Trustees has
determined that such advance disclosure is supported by a legitimate business purpose and
that the recipient by reason of the federal securities laws (1) is prohibited as an
�insider� from trading on the information and (2) has a duty of confidence to
the Funds because the recipient has a history and practice of sharing confidences such
that the recipient of the information knows or reasonably should know that the Funds
expect that the recipient will maintain its confidentiality. These third party service
providers are the Adviser and the Funds� administrator, independent registered public
accountants and custodian. 
��������Rating
and Ranking Organizations 
��������The
Funds� Board of Trustees has determined that the Funds may provide their portfolio
holdings to the rating and ranking organizations listed below on either a monthly or
quarterly basis. 


�

U.S.
  Bancorp Fund Services, LLC Morningstar, Inc. Lipper, Inc.
  Standard & Poor�s Ratings Group
  Bloomberg L.P. 



��������The
determination was made that these organizations provide investors with a valuable service
and, therefore, it is in the best interests of the Funds� shareholders to provide
them with non-public portfolio holdings information. Since this information is not
provided on the condition that it be kept confidential or that these organizations not
trade on the information, such disclosure could provide these organizations with the
ability to make advantageous decisions to place orders for shares of the Funds or to trade
against the Funds to the detriment of other shareholders of the Funds. However, the Funds
will not provide this information until such information is at least 15 days old, after
which time the disclosure of such non-public portfolio holdings should not be problematic.
Also, as noted above, the officers of the Funds receive and review reports on a regular
basis as to any purchases and redemptions of shares of the Funds to determine if there is
any unusual trading in shares of the Funds. The Funds will not pay these organizations. 
B-27 

��������Availability

Audit Committee 
��������The
Trust�s Board of Trustees has created an audit committee whose members consist of Ms.
Cartier, Mr. Forstadt, Mr. Horwich and Ms. Huston, each of whom is a non-interested
Trustee. The primary functions of the audit committee are to select the independent
registered public accounting firm to be retained to perform the annual audit of the Funds,
to review the results of the audit, to review the Funds� internal controls, to
approve in advance all permissible non-audit services performed by the independent
auditors and to review certain other matters relating to the Funds� independent
registered public accounting firm and financial records. The audit committee met twice
during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006.

��������The
Trust�s Board of Trustees has no other committees. 
Compensation 
��������The Trust�s
standard method of compensating the non-interested Trustees is to pay each such Trustee an
annual retainer of $4,000 and a fee of $500 for each meeting of the Board of Trustees
attended. The Trust also reimburses such Trustees for their reasonable travel expenses
incurred in attending meetings of the Board of Trustees. The Trust does not provide

Proxy Voting Policy 
��������Information
on how the Funds voted proxies relating to their portfolio securities during the most
recent twelve-month period ended June 30 is available without charge by calling
1-877-568-7633 or by accessing the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission at
http://www.sec.gov. 
��������The
Trust has delegated proxy voting decisions on securities held in the Funds�
portfolios to the Adviser. The Adviser has adopted a Statement of Proxy Voting Policies
and Procedures (the �Proxy Voting Policies�) that sets forth its proxy voting
policies and procedures. The Adviser�s proxy voting process is dynamic and subject to
periodic review, and, in its discretion, the Adviser may revise the Proxy Voting Policies
in response to its review. The primary objective of the Adviser is to vote proxies in the
manner that it believes will do the most to maximize the value of the Funds�
investments. The Adviser will likely vote against any management proposals that the
Adviser believes could prevent companies from realizing their maximum market value, or
would insulate companies and/or management, from accountability to shareholders or prudent
regulatory compliance. The Adviser will exercise its voting responsibilities in a manner
that is consistent with the general antifraud provisions of the 1940 Act, as well as the
Adviser�s fiduciary duties under the federal and state law to act in the best
interests of the Funds. 
B-31 

��������The
discussion that follows sets forth the Adviser�s proxy voting policies and procedures
regarding specific types of proposals. 
��������Proposals
Respecting Business Operations. Generally, the Adviser will vote proxies in
favor of proposals that are standard and involve necessary aspects of business operations
unless the Adviser�s analysis of the proposal indicates that the proposal is not in
the best interests of the Fund in question as a shareholder of the company. Among factors
that the Adviser will consider in reviewing these proposals include the financial
performance of the company, the attendance and independence of the company�s board
members and committees and the company�s enforcement of strict accounting practices.
By way of example, proposals respecting standard business operations include the
following: 


�
� 
Name
changes;





�
� 
Election
of directors;





�
� 
Ratification
of auditors;





�
� 
Maintaining
current levels of directors� indemnification and liability;





�
� 
Increases
in  authorized  shares  (common  stock only) if there is no intention  to  significantly
 dilute  shareholders' proportionate interests; and





�
� 
Employee
stock purchase or ownership plans.



��������Proposals
Respecting Changes in Status. The Adviser will vote proxies on proposals
that change the status of the company, its individual securities or the ownership status
of the securities in a manner that, in the Adviser�s professional investment
judgment, best benefits the financial and economic interests of the Fund in question. By
way of example, proposals respecting changes in status include the following: 


�
� 
Mergers,
acquisitions, restructurings;





�
� 
Reincorporations;
and 





�
� 
Changes
in capitalization.



��������Proposals
Respecting Shareholder Democracy. Generally, the Adviser will vote proxies
against any proposal that attempts to limit shareholder democracy in a way that could
restrict the ability of shareholders to realize the value of their investment. By way of
example, this would include proposals endorsing or facilitating: 


�
� 
Increased
indemnification protections for directors or officers;





�
� 
Certain
Supermajority Requirements; 





�
� 
Unequal
voting rights;





�
� 
Classified
boards;



B-32 



�
� 
Cumulative
voting;





�
� 
Authorization
of new securities if intention  appears to be to unduly dilute  shareholders'
 proportionate  interests; and





�
� 
Authorization
to change state of incorporation if intention appears to disfavor the economic interest
of the shareholders. 



��������Generally,
the Adviser will vote proxies in favor of any proposal that maintains or expands
shareholder democracy. By way of example, this would include proposals that require: 


�
� 
Annual
elections;





�
� 
Independent
directors; 





�
� 
Confidential
voting; and





�
� 
Shareholder
approval for:





�
� 
Elimination
of cumulative voting or preemptive rights; or 





�
� 
Reclassification
of company boards. 



��������Proposals
Respecting Compensation. The Adviser will vote proxies on proposals
respecting compensation in a manner that, in the Adviser�s professional investment
judgment, best benefits the financial and economic interests of the Fund in question. The
Adviser believes that reasonable compensation is appropriate for directors, executives and
employees, and that compensation should be used to align the interests of the involved
parties with the long-term financial success of the company, but that compensation should
not be excessive. Among the factors that the Adviser will consider are the potential
dilution of outstanding shares, whether a plan has broad-based participation and whether a
plan allows for the re-pricing of options. 
��������Proposals
Respecting Social, Environmental and Other Such Matters. The Adviser will
vote proxies on proposals respecting social, environmental and issues of conscience
impacting the business conduct of a company in a manner that, in the Adviser�s
professional investment judgment, best benefits the financial and economic interests of
the Fund in question. 
��������If
the Adviser determines that voting a particular proxy would create a conflict of interest
between the interests of the Fund in question and its shareholders on the one hand and the
interests of the Adviser, the Fund�s distributor or any affiliate of the Fund, the
Adviser or the Fund�s distributor on the other hand, then the Adviser will take one
or some of the following steps (in its sole discretion): (i) inform the Fund of the
conflict and the Adviser�s voting decision; (ii) discuss the proxy vote with the
Fund; (iii) fully disclose the material facts regarding the conflict and seek the
Fund�s consent to vote the proxy as intended; and/or (iv) seek the recommendations of
an independent third party. Whenever the Adviser determines there is a potential for a
material conflict of interest, the Adviser will document which step or steps it took to
ensure the proxy vote or abstention was in the best interest of the Fund in question and
not the product of any material conflict. 
B-33 

Code of Ethics 
��������Each
of the Trust and the Adviser have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule�17j-1
under the 1940 Act. Each code of ethics permits personnel subject thereto to invest in
securities, including securities that may be purchased or held by the Funds. Each code of
ethics generally prohibits, among other things, persons subject thereto from purchasing or
selling securities if they know at the time of such purchase or sale that the security is
being considered for purchase or sale by the Funds or is being purchased or sold by the
Funds.

Financial Trust Company, which was organized under the laws of the state of Arizona,
controls the Micro Cap Fund, the Active Income Fund and the Trust since it owns sufficient
shares of the Micro Cap Fund and the Active Income Fund to approve or disapprove all
matters brought before shareholders of the Trust, including the election of Trustees of
the Trust. A significant redemption by Genworth Financial Trust Company could affect each
Fund�s liquidity and the future viability of the Fund. Genworth Financial Trust
Company is a registered investment advisor providing advisory services to a variety of
individual and institutional clients. The Funds are offered as one of several investment
choices for these clients. Clients are permitted to transfer some or all of their account
balances into or out of each of the Funds at any time. 
��������The
Trust does not control any person. As of December 31, 2006, all officers and Trustees of
the Micro Cap Fund beneficially owned less than 1% of the Micro Cap Fund as a group. As of
December 31, 2006, all officers and Trustees of the Active Income Fund beneficially owned
less than 1% of the Fund as a group.

fees of all officers and Trustees of the Funds (except the fees paid to non-interested
Trustees) and bears all sales and promotional expenses of the Funds, other than
distribution expenses paid by the Funds pursuant to the Funds� Service and
Distribution Plan, if any. For the foregoing, the Funds pay the Adviser a monthly fee
based on a Fund�s average daily net assets at the annual rate of 0.95% for the Micro
Cap Fund and 0.55% for the Active Income Fund. 
��������The
Funds pay all of their expenses not assumed by the Adviser, including, but not limited to,
the professional costs of preparing and the cost of printing their registration statements
required under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act and any amendments thereto, the
expenses of registering their shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(�SEC�) and qualifying in the various states, the printing and distribution cost
of prospectuses mailed to existing shareholders, the cost of Trustee and officer liability
insurance, reports to shareholders, reports to government authorities and proxy
statements, interest charges on any borrowings, dividend and interest payments on
securities sold short, brokerage commissions, and expenses incurred in connection with
portfolio transactions. The Funds also pay salaries of administrative and clerical
personnel, association membership dues, auditing and accounting services, fees and
expenses of any custodian or trustees having custody of the Funds� assets, expenses
of calculating the NAV and repurchasing and redeeming shares, and charges and expenses of
dividend disbursing agents, registrars, and share transfer agents, including the cost of
keeping all necessary shareholder records and accounts and handling any problems relating
thereto. 
��������The
Adviser is contractually obligated to reimburse the Micro Cap Fund to the extent that the
aggregate annual operating expenses, including the investment advisory fee and the
administration fee but excluding all federal, state and local taxes, interest,
reimbursement payments to securities lenders for dividend and interest payments on
securities sold short, taxes, brokerage commissions and extraordinary items, in any year,
exceed 3.00% of the average net assets of the Fund for such year, as determined by
valuations made as of the close of each business day of the year. 
��������With
respect to the Active Income Fund, the Adviser is contractually liable for the aggregate
expenses of every character incurred by the Fund in any given fiscal year (excluding the
investment advisory fee (0.55% per annum of the average net assets of the Fund) of the
Adviser and all federal, state and local taxes, interest, reimbursement payments to
securities lenders for dividend and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes,
brokerage commissions and extraordinary items), but only the extent that fund operating
expenses exceed 0.45% of the average NAV of the Fund in any given year and are less than
or equal to 1.00% of the average NAV of the Fund in any given year. Accordingly, the
Active Income Fund is liable for its fund operating expenses in excess of 1.00% of the
average NAV of the Fund in a given fiscal year; provided, that in the event the
fund operating expenses in such fiscal year exceed 2.00% of the average NAV of the Fund
for such year, as determined by valuations made as of the close of each business day of
such year, then the Adviser shall reimburse the Fund for such excess. 
B-36 

��������Reimbursement
of expenses in excess of the applicable limitation will be made on a regular basis and
will be paid to the Funds by reduction of the Adviser�s fee, subject to later
adjustment during the remainder of the Funds� fiscal year. The Adviser may from time
to time, at its sole discretion, reimburse the Funds for expenses incurred in addition to
the reimbursement of expenses in excess of applicable limitations. The Funds monitor their
expense ratio at least on a monthly basis. If the accrued amount of the expenses of the
Funds exceeds the expense limitation, the Funds create an account receivable from the
Adviser for the amount of such excess. In such a situation the monthly payment of the
Adviser�s fee will be reduced by the amount of such excess, subject to adjustment
month by month during the balance of the Funds� fiscal year if accrued expenses
thereafter fall below this limit. 
��������Each
Advisory Agreement remains in effect for two (2) years from its effective date and
thereafter continues in effect for as long as its continuance is specifically approved at
least annually, by (i) the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the vote of a majority
(as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding shares of the Fund, and (ii) by the vote
of a majority of the Trustees of the Trust who are not parties to the Advisory Agreement
or interested persons of the Adviser, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose
of voting on such approval. Each Advisory Agreement provides that it may be terminated at
any time without the payment of any penalty, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by
vote of a majority of the Fund�s shareholders, on sixty (60) calendar days written
notice to the Adviser, and by the Adviser on the same notice to the Trust and that it
shall be automatically terminated if it is assigned. 
��������The
Advisory Agreements provide that the Adviser shall not be liable to the Funds or their
shareholders for anything other than willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
reckless disregard of its obligations or duties. The Advisory Agreements also provide that
the Adviser may engage in other businesses, devote time and attention to any other
business whether of a similar or dissimilar nature, and render investment advisory
services to others. 
��������For
services provided by the Adviser under the investment advisory agreement for the Micro Cap
Fund for the fiscal years ended September�30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Micro Cap Fund
paid the Adviser fees of $986,079, $643,552 and $376,956, respectively. 
��������For
services provided by the Adviser under the investment advisory agreement for the Active
Income Fund for the fiscal year ended September�30, 2006, the Active Income Fund paid
the Adviser fees of $293,317. During such fiscal year the Adviser reimbursed the Active
Income Fund $13,478 for excess expenses.

��������The
portfolio managers of the Adviser are often responsible for managing other accounts. The
Adviser typically assigns accounts with similar investment strategies to the portfolio
managers to mitigate the potentially conflicting investment strategies of accounts. Other
than potential conflicts between investment strategies, the side-by-side management of
both the Funds and other accounts may raise potential conflicts of interest due to the
interest held by the Adviser or one of its affiliates in an account and certain trading
practices used by the portfolio managers (for example, cross trades between a Fund and
another account and allocation of aggregated trades). The Adviser has developed policies
and procedures reasonably designed to mitigate those conflicts. In particular, the Adviser
has adopted policies limiting the ability of portfolio managers to cross securities
between Funds (pursuant to these policies, if the Adviser is to act as agent for both the
buyer and seller with respect to transactions in investments, the portfolio manager will
first: (a) obtain approval from the Adviser�s Chief Compliance Officer and (b) inform
the customer of the capacity in which the Adviser is acting; and no dual agency
transaction can be undertaken for any ERISA customer unless an applicable prohibited
transaction exemption applies) and policies designed to ensure the fair allocation of
securities purchased on an aggregated basis (pursuant to these policies all allocations
must be fair between clients and, to be reasonable in the interests of clients, will
generally be made in proportion to the size of the original orders placed). 
��������The
portfolio managers are compensated in various forms. The following table outlines the
forms of compensation paid to each portfolio manager as of December 31, 2006 other than
Messrs. Willemse and Hershey for whom the information is shown as of April 30, 2007. There
are no differences between the method used to determine the portfolio manager�s
compensation with respect to the Funds and other accounts.

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS
AND BROKERAGE 
Generally 
��������Under
the Advisory Agreements, the Adviser is responsible for decisions to buy and sell
securities for the Funds, broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage commission
rates. (These activities of the Adviser are subject to the control of the Trust�s
Board of Trustees, as are all of the activities of the Adviser under the Advisory
Agreements.) The primary consideration of the Adviser in effecting a securities
transaction will be execution at the most favorable securities price. The Trust
understands that some of the portfolio transactions of the Funds may be transacted with
primary market makers acting as principal on a net basis, with no brokerage commissions
being paid by the Funds. Such principal transactions may, however, result in a profit to
market makers. In certain instances the Adviser may make purchases of underwritten issues
for the Funds at prices that include underwriting fees. 
��������In
selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular transaction, the Adviser will take
the following into consideration: the best net price available; the reliability, integrity
and financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the
order; and the value of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the investment
performance of the Funds on a continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Funds in any
transaction may be less favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the
difference is reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio trade execution
services offered. Subject to such policies as the Board of Trustees may determine, the
Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created
by the Advisory Agreements solely by reason of its having caused the Funds to pay a broker
or dealer that provides brokerage or research services to the Adviser an amount of
commission for effecting a portfolio transaction in excess of the amount of commission
another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser
determined in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the
value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in
terms of either that particular transaction or the Adviser�s overall responsibilities
with respect to the Trust or other accounts for which the Adviser has investment
discretion. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on
behalf of the Funds to such brokers or dealers who also provide research or statistical
material, or other services, to the Trust, the Adviser or any affiliate of the foregoing.
Such allocation shall be in such amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine
and the Adviser shall report on such allocations regularly to the Board of Trustees,
indicating the broker-dealers to whom such allocations have been made and the basis
therefore. 
B-44 

Brokerage Commissions 
��������During
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Micro Cap Fund paid brokerage commissions of
$514,312 on transactions having a market value of $192,854,209. All of the brokers to whom
commissions were paid provided research services to the Adviser. During the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2005, the Micro Cap Fund paid brokerage commissions of $282,813 on
transactions having a market value of $118,208,945. During the fiscal year ended September
30, 2004, the Micro Cap Fund paid brokerage commissions of $336,742 on transactions having
a market value of $96,435,486. 
��������During
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Active Income Fund paid no brokerage
commissions. 
NET ASSET VALUE 
��������The
NAV of the Funds will be determined as of the close of regular trading (normally, 4:00
P.M. Eastern Time) on each day the New York Stock Exchange (the �NYSE�) is open
for trading. The NYSE is open for trading Monday through Friday except New Year�s
Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, President�s Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Additionally, if any of
the aforementioned holidays falls on a Saturday, the NYSE will not be open for trading on
the preceding Friday and when any such holiday falls on a Sunday, the NYSE will not be
open for trading on the succeeding Monday, unless unusual business conditions exist, such
as the ending of a monthly or the yearly accounting period. 
��������A
Fund�s NAV is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the value of its net assets
(its assets less its liabilities) by the number of shares outstanding. 
��������In
determining the NAV of a Fund�s shares, securities that are listed on a national
securities exchange (other than The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., referred to as NASDAQ) are
valued at the last sale price on the day the valuation is made. Securities that are traded
on NASDAQ under one of its three listing tiers, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global
Market and NASDAQ Capital Market, are valued at the Nasdaq Official Closing Price.
Securities price information on listed stocks is taken from the exchange where the
security is primarily traded. Securities which are listed on an exchange but which are not
traded on the valuation date are valued at the most recent bid price. Unlisted securities
held by a Fund are valued at the average of the quoted bid and asked prices in the OTC
market. 
��������Securities
and other assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued by
appraisal at their fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under procedures
established by and under the general supervision and responsibility of the Trust�s
Board of Trustees. Short-term investments which mature in less than 60 days are valued at
amortized cost (unless the Board of Trustees determines that this method does not
represent fair value), if their original maturity was 60 days or less, or by amortizing
the value as of the 61st day prior to maturity, if their original term to maturity
exceeded 60 days. Other types of securities that a Fund may hold for which fair value
pricing might be required include, but are not limited to: (a) illiquid securities,
including �restricted� securities and private placements for which there is no
public market; (b) options not traded on a securities exchange; (c) securities of an
issuer that has entered into a restructuring; (d) securities whose trading has been halted
or suspended; and (e) fixed income securities that have gone into default and for which
there is not a current market value quotation. Further, if events occur that materially
affect the value of a security between the time trading ends on that particular security
and the close of the normal trading session of the NYSE, a Fund may value the security at
its fair value. Valuing securities at fair value involves greater reliance on judgment
than securities that have readily available market quotations. There can be no assurance
that a Fund could obtain the fair value assigned to a security if it were to sell the
security at approximately the time at which the Fund determines its NAV per share. 
B-45 

��������The
Active Income Fund prices foreign securities in terms of U.S. dollars at the official
exchange rate. Alternatively, it may price these securities at the average of the current
bid and asked price of such currencies against the dollar last quoted by a major bank that
is a regular participant in the foreign exchange market, or on the basis of a pricing
service that takes into account the quotes provided by a number of such major banks. If
the Active Income Fund does not have either of these alternatives available to it or the
alternatives do not provide a suitable method for converting a foreign currency into U.S.
dollars, the Board of Trustees in good faith will establish a conversion rate for such
currency. 
��������Generally,
U.S. government securities and other fixed income securities complete trading at various
times prior to the close of the NYSE. For purposes of computing NAV, the Active Income
Fund uses the market value of such securities as of the time their trading day ends.
Occasionally, events affecting the value of such securities may occur between such times
and the close of the NYSE, which events would not be reflected in the computation of the
Active Income Fund�s NAV. It is currently the policy of the Active Income Fund that
events affecting the valuation of the Active Income Fund�s securities between such
times and the close of the NYSE, if material, may be reflected in such NAV. 
��������Foreign
securities trading may not take place on all days when the NYSE is open, or may take place
on Saturdays and other days when the NYSE is not open and the Active Income Fund�s
NAV is not calculated. When determining NAV, the Active Income Fund values foreign
securities primarily listed and/or traded in foreign markets at their market value as of
the close of the last primary market where the securities traded. Securities trading in
European countries and Pacific Rim countries is normally completed well before 4:00 P.M.
Eastern Time. It is currently the policy of the Active Income Fund that events affecting
the valuation of the Active Income Fund�s securities occurring between the time its
NAV is determined and the close of the NYSE, if material, may be reflected in such NAV. 
��������The
Funds reserve the right to suspend or postpone redemptions during any period when: (a)
trading on the NYSE is restricted, as determined by the SEC, or the NYSE is closed for
other than customary weekend and holiday closings; (b) the SEC has granted an order to the
Funds permitting such suspension; or (c) an emergency, as determined by the SEC, exists,
making disposal of portfolio securities or valuation of net assets of the Funds not
reasonably practicable. 
TAXES 
General 
��������The
Funds intend to qualify annually for and elect tax treatment applicable to a regulated
investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The discussion that follows is not intended to be a complete discussion of present or
proposed federal income tax laws and the effect of such laws on an investor. Investors are
urged to consult with their tax advisers for a complete review of the tax ramifications of
an investment in the Funds. 
B-46 

��������If
a Fund fails to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M in any fiscal
year, it will be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. As such, the
Fund in question would be required to pay income taxes on its net investment income and
net realized capital gains, if any, at the rates generally applicable to corporations.
Shareholders in the Fund in question would not be liable for income tax on the Fund�s
net investment income or net realized gains in their individual capacities. Distributions
to shareholders, whether from a Fund�s net investment income or net realized capital
gains, would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of current or accumulated
earnings and profits of the Fund in question. 
��������Net
investment income includes interest and dividend income, less expenses. Dividends from the
Micro Cap Fund�s net investment income, including short-term capital gains, are
generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary income (although a portion of such
distributions may be taxable to investors at the lower rate applicable to qualified
dividend income), while distributions of net capital gains are taxable as long-term
capital gains regardless of the shareholder�s holding period for the shares. With
respect to the Active Income Fund, ordinarily, all dividends and distributions from the
Active Income Fund will be treated as ordinary income or loss, due to the �mark to
market� election discussed below. Dividends and distributions are taxable to
shareholders whether received in cash or in additional shares. In the case of corporate
shareholders, dividends from a Fund�s net investment income will qualify for the 70%
dividends-received deduction, subject to proportionate reductions if the aggregate
dividends received by the Fund from domestic corporations in any year are less than 100%
of the distributions of net investment company taxable income made by the Fund. 
��������Any
dividend or capital gain distribution paid shortly after a purchase of shares of a Fund,
will have the effect of reducing the per share NAV of such shares by the amount of the
dividend or distribution. Furthermore, if the NAV of the shares of a Fund immediately
after a dividend or distribution is less than the cost of such shares to the shareholder,
the dividend or distribution will be taxable to the shareholder even though it results in
a return of capital to him. 
��������Redemptions
of shares will generally result in a capital gain or loss for income tax purposes. Such
capital gain or loss will be long term or short term, depending upon the
shareholder�s holding period for the shares. However, if a loss is realized on shares
held for six months or less, and the investor received a capital gain distribution during
that period, then such loss is treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of the
capital gain distribution received. 
Mark to Market Election 
��������The
Active Income Fund will elect as a trader in securities and commodities to mark to market
its portfolio securities held at the end of each taxable year. Under this election, the
Active Income Fund�s income subject to taxation in any year will be equivalent to its
economic results for such year. The mark to market rules require a trader making the
election to recognize gain or loss with respect to the securities held in connection with
its trade or business of trading in securities at the end of each taxable year as if the
trader sold the securities for their fair market value on the last business day of the
taxable year. Any gain or loss on the Active Income Fund�s portfolio securities will
be treated as ordinary income or loss. 
B-47 

Back-up Withholding 
��������Federal
law requires each Fund to withhold 28% of a shareholder�s reportable payments (which
include dividends, capital gains distributions and redemption proceeds) for shareholders
who have not properly certified that the Social Security or other Taxpayer Identification
Number they provide is correct and that the shareholder is not subject to back-up
withholding. 
Foreign Taxes 
��������The
Active Income Fund may be subject to foreign withholding taxes on income and gains derived
from its investments outside the U.S. Such taxes would reduce the return on the Active
Income Fund�s investments. Tax treaties between certain countries and the U.S. may
reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the value of the Active Income
Fund�s total assets at the close of any taxable year consist of stocks or securities
of foreign corporations, the Active Income Fund may elect, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, to treat any foreign country income or withholding taxes paid by the Active
Income Fund that can be treated as income taxes under U.S. income tax principles, as paid
by its shareholders. For any year that the Active Income Fund makes such an election, each
of its shareholders will be required to include in his income (in addition to taxable
dividends actually received) his or her allocable share of such taxes paid by the Active
Income Fund and will be entitled, subject to certain limitations, to credit his or her
portion of these foreign taxes against his or her U.S. federal income tax due, if any, or
to deduct it (as an itemized deduction) from his U.S. taxable income, if any. Generally,
credit for foreign taxes is subject to the limitation that it may not exceed the
shareholder�s U.S. tax attributable to his or her foreign source taxable income. 
��������If
the pass through election described above is made, the source of the Active Income
Fund�s income flows through to its shareholders. Certain gains from the sale of
securities and currency fluctuations will not be treated as foreign source taxable income.
In addition, this foreign tax credit limitation must be applied separately to certain
categories of foreign source income, one of which is foreign source �passive
income.� For this purpose, foreign �passive income� includes dividends,
interest, capital gains and certain foreign currency gains. As a consequence, certain
shareholders may not be able to claim a foreign tax credit for the full amount of their
proportionate share of the foreign tax paid by the Active Income Fund. 
��������Each
shareholder will be notified within 60 days after the close of the Active Income
Fund�s taxable year whether, pursuant to the election described above, the foreign
taxes paid by the Active Income Fund will be treated as paid by its shareholders for that
year and, if so, such notification will designate: (i)�such shareholder�s
portion of the foreign taxes paid; and (ii)�the portion of the Active Income
Fund�s dividends and distributions that represent income derived from foreign
sources. 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
Shareholder Meetings and
Election of Trustees 
��������As
a Delaware statutory trust, the Trust is not required to hold regular annual shareholder
meetings and, in the normal course, does not expect to hold such meetings. The Trust,
however, must hold shareholder meetings for such purposes as, for example: (1) approving
certain agreements as required by the 1940 Act; (2) changing fundamental investment
restrictions of the Funds; and (3) filling vacancies on the Board of Trustees of the Trust
in the event that less than a majority of the Trustees were elected by shareholders. The
Trust expects that there will be no meetings of shareholders for the purpose of electing
Trustees unless and until such time as less than a majority of the Trustees holding office
have been elected by shareholders. At such time, the Trustees then in office will call a
shareholders meeting for the election of Trustees. In addition, the shareholders may
remove any Trustee at any time, with or without cause, by vote of not less than a majority
of the shares then outstanding. Trustees may appoint successor Trustees. 
B-48 

Shares of Beneficial
Interest 
��������The
Trust will issue new shares of a Fund at the Fund�s most current NAV. The Trust is
authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest. The Trust has
registered an indefinite number of shares of the Funds under Rule 24f-2 of the 1940 Act.
Each share has one vote and is freely transferable; shares represent equal proportionate
interests in the assets of the applicable Fund only and have identical voting, dividend,
redemption, liquidation and other rights. The shares, when issued and paid for in
accordance with the terms of the Prospectus, are deemed to be fully paid and
non-assessable. Shares have no preemptive, cumulative voting, subscription or conversion
rights. Shares can be issued as full shares or as fractions of shares. A fraction of a
share has the same kind of rights and privileges as a full share on a pro-rata basis. 
Additional Series 
��������The
Trustees may from time to time establish additional series or classes of shares without
the approval of shareholders. The assets of each series belong only to that series, and
the liabilities of each series are borne solely by that series and no other. 
DESCRIPTION OF
SECURITIES RATINGS 
��������Set
forth below is a description of ratings used by two major nationally recognized
statistical ratings organizations (�NRSROs�), Standard & Poor�s
Corporation (�Standard & Poor�s�) and Moody�s Investors Service,
Inc. (�Moody�s�). NRSROs base their ratings on current information
furnished by the issuer or obtained from other sources they consider reliable. NRSROs may
change, suspend or withdraw their ratings due to changes in, unavailability of, such
information or for other reasons. 
Commercial Paper Ratings 
��������Standard
& Poor�s Commercial Paper Ratings. A Standard & Poor�s commercial
paper rating is a current opinion of the likelihood of timely payment of debt considered
short-term in the relevant market. Ratings are graded into several categories, ranging
from A-1 for the highest quality obligations to D for the lowest. The three highest
categories are as follows: 
��������A-1.
  This highest category indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely
  payment is strong. Those issuers determined to possess extremely strong safety
  characteristics are denoted with a plus sign (+) designation.  
B-49 

��������A-2.
  Capacity for timely payment on issues with this designation is satisfactory.
  However the relative degree of safety is not as high as for issuers designated
  �A-1".  
��������A-3.
  Issues carrying this designation have adequate capacity for timely payment.
They  are, however, more vulnerable to the adverse effects of changes in
circumstances  than obligations carrying a higher designation.  
��������Moody�s
Investors Service, Inc Commercial Paper. Moody�s short-term debt ratings are
opinions of the ability of issuers to repay punctually senior debt obligations. These
obligations have an original maturity not exceeding one year, unless explicitly noted.
Moody�s ratings are opinions, not recommendations to buy or sell, and their accuracy
is not guaranteed. 
��������Moody�s
employs the following three designations, all judged to be investment grade, to indicate
the relative repayment ability of rated issuers: 
��������Prime-1
� Issuers rated Prime-1 (or supporting institutions) have a superior ability for
repayment of senior short-term debt obligations. Prime-1 repayment ability will often be
evidenced by many of the following characteristics: 


�
- 
Leading
market positions in well-established industries.





�
- 
High
rates of return on funds employed.





�
- 
Conservative
capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt and ample asset protection. 





�
- 
Broad
margins in earnings coverage of fixed financial charges and high internal cash
generation. 





�
- 
Well-established
access to a range of financial markets and assured sources of alternate liquidity. 



��������Prime-2
� Issuers rated Prime-2 (or supporting institutions) have a strong ability for
repayment of senior short-term debt obligations. This will normally be evidenced by many
of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser degree. Earnings trends and coverage
ratios, while sound, may be more subject to variation. Capitalization characteristics,
while still appropriate, may be more affected by external conditions. Ample alternate
liquidity is maintained. 
��������Prime-3
� Issuers rated Prime-3 (or supporting institutions) have an acceptable ability for
repayment of senior short-term obligations. The effect of industry characteristics and
market compositions may be more pronounced. Variability in earnings and profitability may
result in changes in the level of debt protection measurements and may require relatively
high financial leverage. Adequate alternate liquidity is maintained. 
Corporate Long-Term Debt
Ratings 
��������Standard
& Poor�s Debt Ratings. A Standard�& Poor�s corporate debt
rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a
specific financial obligation. It takes into consideration the creditworthiness of
guarantors, insurers, or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation. 
B-50 

��������The
debt rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a security, inasmuch as it
does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor. 
��������The
ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by Standard
& Poor�s from other sources it considers reliable. Standard & Poor�s
does not perform any audit in connection with any rating and may, on occasion, rely on
unaudited financial information. The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a
result of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or for other circumstances. 
��������The
ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations: 


�
- 
Likelihood
of payment � capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial
commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation; 





�
- 
Nature
of and provisions of the obligation; and





�
- 
Protection
afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in the event of bankruptcy,
reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting
creditors� rights. 



��������The
issue ratings definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As such, they pertain to
senior obligations of an entity, Junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior
obligations, to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy. 
Investment Grade 
���������AAA�
This is the highest rating that may be assigned by Standard & Poor�s to a debt
instrument and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay the debt obligations. 
���������AA�
Debt rated �AA� also qualifies as a high-quality fixed income security. The
capacity to pay debt obligations is very strong, although not as overwhelming as for
issues rated �AAA.� 
���������A�
An issued rated �A� is backed by a sound capacity to pay the debt obligations,
although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions. 
���������BBB�
An issue rated �BBB� is regarded as backed by an adequate capacity to pay the
debt obligations. Whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters, adverse
economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened
capacity to make payments for debt in this category than for issues in the �A�
category. 
Speculative Grade 
��������Debt
rated �BB,� �B,� �CCC,� �CC� and �C� is
regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to capacity to
pay interest and repay principal. �BB� indicates the least degree of speculation
and �C� the highest. While such debt will likely have some quality and
protective characteristic, these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk
exposures to adverse conditions. 
B-51 

���������BB�
� Debt rated �BB� has less near-term vulnerability to default than other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse
business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to inadequate capacity to
meet timely interest and principal payments. The �BB� rating category is also
used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied
�BBB-�rating. 
���������B�
� Debt rated �B� has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has
the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments. Adverse business,
financial, or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to pay
interest and repay principal. The �B� rating category is also used for debt
subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied �BB� or
�BB-�rating. 
���������CCC�
� Debt rated �CCC� has a current identifiable vulnerability to default, and
is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet timely
payment of interest and repayment of principal. In the event of adverse business,
financial, or economic conditions, it is not likely to have the capacity to pay interest
and repay principal. The �CCC� rating category is also used for debt
subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied �B� or
�B-� rating. 
���������CC�
� Debt rated �CC� typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt
that is assigned an actual or implied �CCC� rating. 
���������C�
� Debt rated �C� typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt
which is assigned an actual or implied �CCC-� debt rating. The �C�
rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed, but
debt service payments are continued. 
���������CI�
� The rating �CI� is reserved for income bonds on which no interest is
being paid. 
���������D�
� Debt rated �D� is in payment default. The �D� rating category
is used when interest payments or principal payments are not made on the date due even if
the applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor�s believes
that such payments will be made during such period. The �D� rating also will be
used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition if debt service payments are jeopardized. 
��������Moody�s
Long-Term Debt Ratings. Moody�s ratings are opinions, not recommendations to buy
or sell, and their accuracy is not guaranteed. 
���������Aaa�
Bonds which are rated �Aaa� are judged to be the best quality. They carry the
smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as �gilt
edged.� Interest payments are protected by a large, or by an exceptionally stable
margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely to
change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally
strong position of such issues. 
B-52 

���������Aa�
Bonds which are �Aa� are judged to be of high quality by all standards. Together
with the �Aaa� group they comprise what are generally known as high-grade bonds.
They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large
as in �Aaa� securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater
amplitude, or there may be other elements present which make the long-term risks appear
somewhat larger than in �Aaa� securities. 
���������A�
Bonds which are rated �A� possess many favorable investment attributes and are
to be considered as upper-medium grade obligations. Factors giving security to principal
and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present which suggest a
susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. 
���������Baa�
Bonds which are rated �Baa� are considered as medium grade obligations; (i.e.,
they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured). Interest payments and principal
security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or
may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such bonds lack
outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as
well. 
���������Ba�
Bonds which are rated �Ba� are judged to have speculative elements; their future
cannot be considered as well-assured. Often the protection of interest and principal
payments may be very moderate, and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad
times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class. 
���������B�
Bonds which are rated �B� generally lack characteristics of the desirable
investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms
of the contract over any long period of time may be small. 
���������Caa�
Bonds which are rated �Caa� are of poor standing. Such issues may be in default
or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest. 
���������Ca�
Bonds which are rated �Ca� represent obligations which are speculative in a high
degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings. 
���������C�
Bonds which are rated �C� are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so
rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any real
investment standing. 
��������Moody�s
applies numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each of the foregoing generic rating
classifications. The modifier 1 indicates that the company ranks in the higher end of its
generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3
indicates that the company ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category.
