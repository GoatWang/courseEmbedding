					Full Description



Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Tetraphase), incorporated on July 7, 2006, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company uses its chemistry technology to create antibiotics for multidrug-resistant infections. The Company is developing its lead product candidate, eravacycline, a fully synthetic tetracycline derivative, as a spectrum intravenous (IV) and oral antibiotic for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant infections, including multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections. The Company also develops TP-6076 for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections.Eravacycline is a fluorocycline antibiotic. The Company is conducting a global Phase III clinical program for eravacycline called Investigating Gram-Negative Infections Treated with Eravacycline (IGNITE), which is evaluating eravacycline in complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). It is also pursuing the discovery and development of additional antibiotics that target unmet medical needs, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacteria.TP-271 is a fully synthetic fluorocycline being developed for respiratory disease caused by bacterial biothreat pathogens in healthy volunteers. In its development program for TP-271, it has conducted a number of in vitro, toxicology and animal studies to evaluate the efficacy of TP-271 against biothreat pathogens. In susceptibility studies, TP-271 also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category A and B public health bacterial pathogens, including Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Bacillus anthracis, and NIAID Category C public health bacterial pathogens (in vitro and in vivo) that are associated with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), including Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Legionella pneumophila, including strains that are tetracycline-resistant. It has initiated a Phase I clinical trial of the IV formulation of TP-271. This trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose study in up to 56 healthy volunteers.

To discuss the top-line data from the phase 3 IGNITE4 clinical trial


Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Positive Results from Phase 3 IGNITE4 Clinical Trial in Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections
Jul 25 17
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced positive top-line results from IGNITE4, the company's phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of twice-daily intravenous (IV) eravacycline compared to meropenem for the treatment of patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). The results of IGNITE4, which enrolled 500 patients, demonstrated statistical non-inferiority of eravacycline to meropenem for the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical response at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit. Eravacycline achieved high clinical cure rates in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections, comparable to patients in the meropenem group. The primary efficacy analysis under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin in the micro-ITT population. Clinical cure rates in the micro-ITT population were 90.8% and 91.2% for eravacycline (n=195) and meropenem (n=205), respectively (95% CI: -6.3%,5.3%). Under the EMA guidance, the primary analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin of the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) patient populations. Clinical cure rates in the MITT population were 92.4% and 91.6% for eravacycline (n=250) and meropenem (n=249), respectively (95% CI: -4.1%,5.8%). Clinical cure rates in the CE population were 96.9% and 96.1% for eravacycline (n=225) and meropenem (n=231), respectively (95% CI: -2.9%,4.5%). Eravacycline met the primary efficacy endpoints according to the FDA and EMA guidelines. The secondary analyses were consistent with, and supportive of, the primary outcome. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) in the trial. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) rates were similar in both treatment groups. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events (AEs) for eravacycline were infusion site reactions, nausea and vomiting, each occurring at a rate of less than 5%. The AE profile for IV eravacycline in IGNITE4 was consistent with that seen in the previously completed phase 3 IGNITE1 and phase 2 clinical trials in cIAI. The spectrum of pathogens in this trial was similar to that seen in previously completed clinical trials in this patient population. The most common Gram-negative pathogens in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides. Tetraphase plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA), which will be supported by data from the IGNITE1 and IGNITE4 clinical trials, to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018. The company also remains on track to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) during the third quarter of 2017. In addition, Tetraphase plans to submit detailed results from the phase 3 IGNITE4 clinical trial for presentation at a future scientific meeting.


Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Patheon UK Limited and Certain of its Affiliates Enter into Master Manufacturing Services Agreement
Jun 20 17
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Patheon UK Limited and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Patheon) entered into a master manufacturing services agreement (the master agreement). Under the master agreement, the company is responsible for supplying the active pharmaceutical ingredient for eravacycline to Patheon, and Patheon is responsible for manufacturing eravacycline, conducting quality control, quality assurance, analytical testing and stability testing and packaging. The company expects to enter into two related product agreements (each a product agreement) pursuant to the master agreement to govern the terms and conditions of Patheon's manufacture of commercial supplies of eravacycline, the company's lead product candidate, at Patheon's Greenville, North Carolina and Ferentino, Italy manufacturing sites. Each product agreement that the company may enter into from time to time will be governed by the terms of the master agreement, unless expressly modified in such product agreement. Pursuant to the master agreement, the company has agreed to order from Patheon at least a certain percentage of its annual commercial requirements for eravacycline in the United States and European Union each year for the term of the master agreement. The master agreement has an initial term ending December 31, 2022, and will automatically renew after the initial term for successive terms of two years each, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate the master agreement at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term. The company may terminate a product agreement upon 30 days' prior written notice if any governmental agency takes any action that prevents the company from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling eravacycline. Either party may terminate the master agreement or a product agreement upon written notice if the other party has failed to remedy a material breach under the master agreement or a product agreement within a specified time following receipt of written notice of such breach, and immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event that the other party is declared insolvent or bankrupt, a voluntary petition of bankruptcy is filed in any court by such other party or the master agreement or a product agreement is assigned by such other party for the benefit of creditors. Patheon may terminate the master agreement or a product agreement upon six months written notice if the company assigns the master agreement to an assignee that, in the opinion of Patheon acting reasonably, is not a creditworthy substitute for the company, or a competitor of Patheon. The master agreement contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant to Patheon of certain limited license rights to the company's intellectual property in connection with Patheon's performance of the services under the master agreement, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions.

Style Scores:



FÂ Value | FÂ Growth | AÂ Momentum | FÂ VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
