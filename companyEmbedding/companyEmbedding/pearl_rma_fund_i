COID Benefits
RMA is licenced by the Minister of Labour to administer claims in terms of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act (COIDA) for Class IV (Mining), Class XIII (Iron, steel, artificial limbs, galvanising, garage and metals) and related industries. The Compensation Fund is responsible for overseeing the compliance of RMA regarding all the requirements of COIDA.
COIDA, 130 of 1993, as amended regulates how and when employees who have been injured at work or who have contracted an illness or disease in the workplace are compensated and clearly sets out the legal requirements for tariffs, compensation and the limitations for workers’ claims.
COIDA provides for medical examination and treatment, disability certification and compensation. Similarly, when an employee has died as a result of injuries sustained in the workplace or an occupational disease, the dependants of the deceased employee may qualify for benefits.
COIDA covers the following employees (whether permanently or casually employed):

Those who were injured in an accident at work;
Those who contracted an occupational disease or illness at work;
Those who died from a workplace accident or occupational disease.

Compensation is calculated as a percentage of the employee’s earnings at the time the injury occurred or the disease was diagnosed.
Employers must report the injury/illness to RMA in order for the employee to receive benefits from RMA, provided RMA has accepted liability for the claim. The employee may be entitled to receive compensation for medical treatment, temporary total disablement and permanent disablement in the form of lump sums, disability pensions or funeral and fatal benefits to the family in the case of an employee’s death.
COIDA defines the term accident as “an event which occurred out of and in the course of an employee’s employment and resulted in personal injury, illness or the death of the employee”.
Occupational diseases are stipulated under section 65 of COIDA as “any disease that has arisen out of and in the course of employment”. This presumes that if the employee is exposed to the risk factor, the scheduled disease is the result of that exposure, unless proven otherwise.

It encompasses all the necessary components to ensure a secure, controlled and efficient system to meet and support a business’s processing needs and requirements.

RMA’s system was developed specifically for the administration of compensation claims and has thus integration and automation of the following functional areas:

Claims adjudication
Pension adjudication
Employer management
Financial management
Medical management
Electronic document management
Electronic submission of claims by employers
Electronic submission of earnings declarations by employers

The system has the capability to maintain policies and premiums, generate policy quotations and invoices, maintain policy benefits, administer claims, adjudicate claims, process claim benefit payments, maintain and generate medical treatment pre-authorisation, process medical invoices including tariff validations and pre-authorisation, and maintain and process pension payments. The system has a built-in ICD10 code medical costing, and temporary and permanent disability and maximum medical improvement (MMI) estimation models. The system is enabled for workflow and electronic document management and integrates directly with the financial/general ledger system. It is built on a three tier architecture and is web-enabled, making it scalable and easily accessible by the end user.
The effect of this integrated system is the efficient collection of premiums, speedy resolution of claims, better management information system and improved service delivery.
The competency level of staff in the enhancing and supporting of IT systems is high and continues to be developed on an on-going basis through training and development.
RMA’s IT system has enabled RMA to remain at the cutting-edge of adjudications of compensation claims. The company continues to seek and develop new ways of providing better service through appropriate adoption and use of technology.
Having been built around the COIDA legislation it was a perfect fit for the Compensation Fund’s own claims management process. In August 2014 the Compensation Fund commenced with the adjudication of claims using the RMA system, renamed by the Fund as Umehluko.
