Source: Lipper, Inc. Returns for Class A shares since inception on April 7, 1992 reflect the reinvestment of distributions, but does not include sales charges, which would have reduced the performance. Broad benchmark represented by the MSCI All Country World ex-US Index and the style benchmark represented by the Custom Invesco International Growth Index, which is comprised of the MSCI EAFE Growth Index from fund inception to Feb. 28, 2013, and the MSCI AC World ex-US Growth Index thereafter. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Data of both indexes as of month-end closest to fund inception. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. An investment cannot be made directly in an index.

Benchmark is the Custom International Growth Index. Cumulative return for the benchmark from March 31, 1992, closest month-end to fund inception through March 31, 2017.

The standard deviation for the fund since inception was 15.79% and 16.09% for the benchmark from April 30, 1992, closest month-end following inception of April 7, 1992, through March 31, 2017. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee comparable future results.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

 About risk
			 


Depositary Receipts Risk. Investing in depositary receipts involves the same risks as direct investments in foreign securities. In addition, the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts. The Fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than if it invested directly in the foreign issuer.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility, political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets. In addition, emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Geographic Focus Risk. The Fund may from time to time invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries. Adverse economic, political or social conditions in those countries may therefore have a significant negative impact on the Fund's investment performance.
Growth Investing Risk. Growth stocks tend to be more expensive relative to the issuing company's earnings or assets compared with other types of stock. As a result, they tend to be more sensitive to changes in, or investors' expectations of, the issuing company's earnings and can be more volatile.
Investing in the European Union Risk. Investments in certain countries in the European Union are susceptible to high economic risks associated with high levels of debt, such as investments in sovereign debt of Greece, Italy and Spain. Separately, the European Union faces issues involving its membership, structure, procedures and policies. The exit of one or more member states from the European Union would place its currency and banking system in jeopardy. Efforts of the member states to further unify their economic and monetary policies may increase the potential for the downward movement of one member state's market to cause a similar effect on other member states' markets.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. Mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.
Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. Preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments, subjecting them to a greater risk of non-payment, may be less liquid than many other securities, such as common stocks, and generally offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer.

Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is organized as a Delaware statutory trust and is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. Each Trust currently intends to introduce at least one series of shares (each, a “Series”) with its own distinct investment objective, policies and restrictions that would operate under a multi-manager structure. The Advisor is a Delaware corporation and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”).[1] 
           The Advisor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Invesco Ltd (“Invesco”). Invesco maintains an asset management presence through wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the Advisor.
2. Each Series has or will have, as its investment adviser, the Advisor, or an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Advisor or its successors (included in the term, the “Advisor”).[2] 
           The Advisor will serve as the investment adviser to each Series pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with the relevant Trust (“Investment Management Agreement'). Each Investment Management Agreement has been or will be approved by the board of trustees of the relevant Trust (“Board”),[3] 
           including a majority of the members of the Board who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, of the Series or the Advisor (“Independent Board Members”) and by the shareholders of the relevant Series as required by sections 15(a) and 15(c) of the Act and rule 18f-2 thereunder. The terms of these Investment Management Agreements comply or will comply with section 15(a) of the Act.
3. Under the terms of each Investment Management Agreement, the Advisor, subject to the supervision of the Board, will provide continuous investment management of the assets of each Series. The Advisor will periodically review a Series' investment policies and strategies, and based on the need of a particular Series may recommend changes to the investment policies and strategies of the Series for consideration by the Board. For its services to each Series under the applicable Investment Management Agreement, the Advisor will receive an investment management fee from that Series. Each Investment Management Agreement provides that the Advisor may, subject to the approval of the Board, including a majority of the Independent Board Members, and the shareholders of the applicable Subadvised Series (if required), delegate portfolio management responsibilities of all or a portion of the assets of a Subadvised Series to one or more Sub-Advisors.[4] 

4. Applicants request an order to permit the Advisor, subject to the approval of the Board of the relevant Trust, including a majority of the Independent Board Members, to, without obtaining shareholder approval: (i) Select Sub-Advisors to manage all or a portion of the assets of a Series and enter into Sub-Advisory Agreements (as defined below) with the Sub-Advisors, and (ii) materially amend Sub-Advisory Agreements with the Sub-Advisors.[5] 
           The requested relief will not extend to any sub-adviser, other than a Wholly-Owned Sub-Advisor, who is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Subadvised Series, the applicable Trust, or of the Advisor, other than by reason of serving as a sub-adviser to one or more of the Subadvised Series (“Affiliated Sub-Advisor”).
5. Pursuant to each Investment Management Agreement, the Advisor has overall responsibility for the management and investment of the assets of each Subadvised Series. These responsibilities include recommending the removal or replacement of Sub-Advisors, determining the portion of that Subadvised Series' assets to be managed by any given Sub-Advisor and reallocating those assets as necessary from time to time.
6. The Advisor may enter into sub-advisory agreements with various Sub-Advisors (“Sub-Advisory Agreements”) to provide investment management services to the Subadvised Series. The terms of each Sub-Advisory Agreement comply or will comply fully with the requirements of section 15(a) of the Act and have been or will be approved by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Board Members and the initial shareholder of the applicable Subadvised Series, in accordance with sections 15(a) and 15(c) of the Act and rule 18f-2 thereunder. The Sub-Advisors, subject to the supervision of the Advisor and oversight of the Board, will determine the securities and other investments to be purchased or sold by a Subadvised Series and place orders with brokers or dealers that they select. The Advisor will compensate each Sub-Advisor out of the fee paid to the Advisor under the applicable Investment Management Agreement.
7. Subadvised Series will inform shareholders of the hiring of a new Sub-Advisor pursuant to the following procedures (“Modified Notice and Access Procedures”): (a) Within 90 days after a new Sub-Advisor is hired for any Subadvised Series, that Subadvised Series will send its shareholders either a Multi-manager Notice or a Multi-manager Notice and Multi-manager Information Statement; [6] 
           and (b) the Start Printed Page 69887Subadvised Series will make the Multi-manager Information Statement available on the Web site identified in the Multi-manager Notice no later than when the Multi-manager Notice (or Multi-manager Notice and Multi-manager Information Statement) is first sent to shareholders, and will maintain it on that Web site for at least 90 days. In the circumstances described in the application, a proxy solicitation to approve the appointment of new Sub-Advisors provides no more meaningful information to shareholders than the proposed Multi-manager Information Statement. Applicants state that each Board would comply with the requirements of sections 15(a) and 15(c) of the Act before entering into or amending Sub-Advisory Agreements.
8. Applicants also request an order exempting the Subadvised Series from certain disclosure obligations that may require each Subadvised Series to disclose fees paid by the Advisor to each Sub-Advisor. Applicants seek relief to permit each Subadvised Series to disclose (as a dollar amount and a percentage of the Subadvised Series' net assets): (a) The aggregate fees paid to the Advisor and any Wholly-Owned Sub-Advisors; (b) the aggregate fees paid to Non-Affiliated Sub-Advisors; and (c) the fee paid to each Affiliated Sub-Advisor (collectively, the “Aggregate Fee Disclosure”).
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 15(a) of the Act states, in part, that it is unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company “except pursuant to a written contract, which contract, whether with such registered company or with an investment adviser of such registered company, has been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such registered company.” Rule 18f-2 under the Act provides that each series or class of stock in a series investment company affected by a matter must approve that matter if the Act requires shareholder approval.
2. Form N-1A is the registration statement used by open-end investment companies. Item 19(a)(3) of Form N-1A requires a registered investment company to disclose in its statement of additional information the method of computing the “advisory fee payable” by the investment company, including the total dollar amounts that the investment company “paid to the adviser (aggregated with amounts paid to affiliated advisers, if any), and any advisers who are not affiliated persons of the adviser, under the investment advisory contract for the last three fiscal years.”
3. Rule 20a-1 under the Act requires proxies solicited with respect to a registered investment company to comply with Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act. Items 22(c)(1)(ii), 22(c)(1)(iii), 22(c)(8) and 22(c)(9) of Schedule 14A, taken together, require a proxy statement for a shareholder meeting at which the advisory contract will be voted upon to include the “rate of compensation of the investment adviser,” the “aggregate amount of the investment adviser's fee,” a description of the “terms of the contract to be acted upon,” and, if a change in the advisory fee is proposed, the existing and proposed fees and the difference between the two fees.
4. Regulation S-X sets forth the requirements for financial statements required to be included as part of a registered investment company's registration statement and shareholder reports filed with the Commission. Sections 6-07(2)(a), (b), and (c) of Regulation S-X require a registered investment company to include in its financial statement information about the investment advisory fees.
5. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission by order upon application may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions from any provisions of the Act, or from any rule thereunder, if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that their requested relief meets this standard for the reasons discussed below.
6. Applicants assert that the shareholders expect the Advisor, subject to the review and approval of the Board, to select the Sub-Advisors who are in the best position to achieve the Subadvised Series' investment objective. Applicants assert that, from the perspective of the shareholder, the role of the Sub-Advisors is substantially equivalent to the role of the individual portfolio managers employed by an investment adviser to a traditional investment company. Applicants believe that permitting the Advisor to perform the duties for which the shareholders of the Subadvised Series are paying the Advisor—the selection, supervision and evaluation of the Sub-Advisors—without incurring unnecessary delays or expenses is appropriate in the interest of the Subadvised Series' shareholders and will allow such Subadvised Series to operate more efficiently. Applicants state that each Investment Management Agreement will continue to be fully subject to section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act and approved by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Board Members, in the manner required by sections 15(a) and 15(c) of the Act. Applicants are not seeking an exemption with respect to the Investment Management Agreements.
7. Applicants assert that disclosure of the individual fees that the Advisor would pay to the Sub-Advisors of Subadvised Series that operate under the multi-manager structure described in the application would not serve any meaningful purpose. Applicants contend that the primary reasons for requiring disclosure of individual fees paid to Sub-Advisors are to inform shareholders of expenses to be charged by a particular Subadvised Series and to enable shareholders to compare the fees to those of other comparable investment companies. Applicants believe that the requested relief satisfies these objectives because the advisory fee paid to the Advisor will be fully disclosed and, therefore, shareholders will know what the Subadvised Series' fees and expenses are and will be able to compare the advisory fees a Subadvised Series is charged to those of other investment companies. Applicants assert that the requested disclosure relief would benefit shareholders of the Subadvised Series because it would improve the Advisor's ability to negotiate the fees paid to Sub-Advisors. Applicants state that the Advisor may be able to negotiate rates that are below a Sub-Advisor's “posted” amounts if the Advisor is not required to disclose the Sub-Advisors' fees to the public. Applicants submit that the relief Start Printed Page 69888requested to use Aggregate Fee Disclosure will encourage Sub-Advisors to negotiate lower subadvisory fees with the Advisor if the lower fees are not required to be made public.
8. For the reasons discussed above, applicants submit that the requested relief meets the standards for relief under section 6(c) of the Act. Applicants state that the operation of the Subadvised Series in the manner described in the application must be approved by shareholders of a Subadvised Series before that Subadvised Series may rely on the requested relief. In addition, applicants state that the proposed conditions to the requested relief are designed to address any potential conflicts of interest, including any posed by the use of Wholly-Owned Sub-Advisors, and provide that shareholders are informed when new Sub-Advisors are hired. Applicants assert that conditions 6, 10 and 11 are designed to provide the Board with sufficient independence and the resources and information it needs to monitor and address any conflicts of interest with affiliated persons of the Advisor, including Wholly-Owned Sub-Advisors. Applicants state that, accordingly, they believe the requested relief is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions: [7] 

1. Before a Subadvised Series may rely on the order requested in the application, the operation of the Subadvised Series in the manner described in the application, including the hiring of Wholly-Owned Sub-Advisors, will be, or has been, approved by a majority of the Subadvised Series' outstanding voting securities as defined in the Act, or, in the case of a new Subadvised Series whose public shareholders purchase shares on the basis of a prospectus containing the disclosure contemplated by condition 2 below, by the sole initial shareholder before offering the Subadvised Series' shares to the public.
2. The prospectus for each Subadvised Series will disclose the existence, substance, and effect of any order granted pursuant to the application. Each Subadvised Series will hold itself out to the public as employing the multi-manager structure described in the application. Each prospectus will prominently disclose that the Advisor has the ultimate responsibility, subject to oversight by the Board, to oversee the Sub-Advisors and recommend their hiring, termination and replacement.
3. The Advisor will provide general management services to a Subadvised Series, including overall supervisory responsibility for the general management and investment of the Subadvised Series' assets. Subject to review and approval of the Board, the Advisor will (a) set a Subadvised Series' overall investment strategies, (b) evaluate, select, and recommend Sub-Advisors to manage all or a portion of a Subadvised Series' assets, and (c) implement procedures reasonably designed to ensure that Sub-Advisors comply with a Subadvised Series' investment objective, policies and restrictions. Subject to review by the Board, the Advisor will (a) when appropriate, allocate and reallocate a Subadvised Series' assets among multiple Sub-Advisors; and (b) monitor and evaluate the performance of Sub-Advisors.
4. A Subadvised Series will not make any Ineligible Sub-Advisor Changes without the approval of the shareholders of the applicable Subadvised Series.
5. Subadvised Series will inform shareholders of the hiring of a new Sub-Advisor within 90 days after the hiring of the new Sub-Advisor pursuant to the Modified Notice and Access Procedures.
6. At all times, at least a majority of the Board will be Independent Board Members, and the selection and nomination of new or additional Independent Board Members will be placed within the discretion of the then-existing Independent Board Members.
7. Independent Legal Counsel, as defined in rule 0-1(a)(6) under the Act, will be engaged to represent the Independent Board Members. The selection of such counsel will be within the discretion of the then-existing Independent Board Members.
8. The Advisor will provide the Board, no less frequently than quarterly, with information about the profitability of the Advisor on a per Subadvised Series basis. The information will reflect the impact on profitability of the hiring or termination of any sub-adviser during the applicable quarter.
9. Whenever a sub-adviser is hired or terminated, the Advisor will provide the Board with information showing the expected impact on the profitability of the Advisor.
10. Whenever a sub-adviser change is proposed for a Subadvised Series with an Affiliated Sub-Advisor or a Wholly-Owned Sub-Advisor, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Board Members, will make a separate finding, reflected in the Board minutes, that such change is in the best interests of the Subadvised Series and its shareholders, and does not involve a conflict of interest from which the Advisor or the Affiliated Sub-Advisor or Wholly-Owned Sub-Advisor derives an inappropriate advantage.
11. No Board member or officer of a Subadvised Series, or director or officer of the Advisor, will own directly or indirectly (other than through a pooled investment vehicle that is not controlled by such person), any interest in a Sub-Advisor, except for (a) ownership of interests in the Advisor or any entity, other than a Wholly-Owned Sub-Advisor, that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Advisor, or (b) ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding securities of any class of equity or debt of a publicly traded company that is either a Sub-Advisor or an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a Sub-Advisor.
12. Each Subadvised Series will disclose the Aggregate Fee Disclosure in its registration statement.
13. In the event the Commission adopts a rule under the Act providing substantially similar relief to that requested in the application, the requested order will expire on the effective date of that rule.

1.
     Applicants request that the relief apply to applicants, as well as to any future Series and any other existing or future registered open-end management investment company or series thereof that is advised by the Advisor, uses the multi-manager structure described in the application, and complies with the terms and conditions of the application (“Subadvised Series”). All registered open-end investment companies that currently intend to rely on the requested order are named as applicants. Any entity that relies on the requested order will do so only in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the application. If the name of any Subadvised Series contains the name of a Sub-Advisor (as defined below), the name of the Advisor that serves as the primary adviser to the Subadvised Series, or a trademark or trade name that is owned by or publicly used to identify that Advisor, will precede the name of the Sub-Advisor.

AIM Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds) (File No. 333-170585)



AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector Funds) (File No. 333-170592)




Dear Mr. DiStefano:
�
On behalf of the above named registrants (the �Registrants�), below you will find the Registrants� responses to the comments conveyed by you via telephone on December 3, 2010, with regard to the Registrants� Registration Statements on Form N-14 (the �N-14s�) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (�SEC�) on November 12, 2010, relating to the reorganization of certain Invesco Funds (the �Target Funds�) into other funds within the Invesco Family of Funds (the �Acquiring Funds� and, together with the Target Funds, the �Funds�).


For your convenience, we have summarized each of your comments in bold and have set forth the Registrants� response immediately below each comment.��Any disclosure changes required by these responses will be incorporated into either a post-effective amendment filing made pursuant to Rule 485(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (�1933 Act�) or a definitive proxy statement/prospectus filing made pursuant to Rule 497 under the 1933 Act.��Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this letter have the meanings assigned to the terms in the N-14s.
�

�

� 


� 





� 





General comments � All N-14s
�


1.�����������Comment:��Under the caption �Summary of Key Information�Will there be any tax consequences resulting from the proposal?� discuss whether there will be any pre-merger sale of non-conforming securities that will result in taxable gain to shareholders of the Target Funds.


Response:��An analysis was performed regarding the tax impact of any portfolio repositioning expected to occur in connection with each Reorganization proposed.��Three funds were identified as having repositioning costs that would result in recognized gains above a de minims amount, determined by management.��In these three instances, disclosure regarding such repositioning costs, which is currently included under the section titled �Comparison of Principal Investment Strategies � Repositioning Costs,� will also be added to the section referenced in your comment.��The three funds to which this disclosure applies are Invesco Van Kampen Small Cap Value Fund, Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund and Invesco Global Core Equity Fund.


2.�����������Comment:��In the �Comparison of Principal Investment Strategies� section of each N-14, any discussion of derivatives should include detailed, fund-specific disclosure per
the SEC�s July 30, 2010 letter to the Investment Company Institute entitled �Derivatives-Related Disclosures by Investment Companies.�


Response:��The disclosure in the �Comparison of Principal Investment Strategies� section is derived from, and closely mirrors, the principal investment strategies described in each Fund�s prospectus on Form N-1A.��The derivatives disclosure in the Funds� Form N-1A prospectuses is being revised to reflect the SEC�s July 30, 2010 guidance in connection with the annual update to the prospectuses; however, not all of the prospectuses have been updated since the guidance was issued.��Where the derivatives disclosure in a Target or Acquiring Fund�s Form N-1A prospectus has been updated, the Registrants will ensure such updates are reflected in the comparative investment strategy discussion in the N-14.��In circumstances where the Form N-1A disclosure has not yet been updated to reflect the
Staff�s guidance, the Registrants respectfully request to keep the disclosure in the N-14 regarding a Fund�s investment strategy consistent with the current N-1A disclosure to avoid confusion in the marketplace and among shareholders.


3.�����������Comment:��In the �Comparison of Principal Investment Strategies� section of each N-14, please highlight the differences between the principal strategies of the Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund(s).


Response: The Registrants have reviewed and, where necessary, revised the disclosure in the �Comparison of Principal Investment Strategies� section to better highlight the key differences between the Target Funds� and Acquiring Funds� principal investment strategies.


4.�����������Comment:��In the �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� section of each N-14, any discussion of risks related to derivatives should include detailed, fund-specific disclosure per the SEC�s July 30, 2010 letter to the Investment Company Institute entitled �Derivatives-Related Disclosures by Investment Companies.�
�


� 


2





� 




Response:��The disclosure in the �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� section is derived from, and closely mirrors, the principal risks described in each Fund�s prospectus on Form N-1A.��As noted above in the Registrants� response to Comment #2, the derivatives disclosure in the Funds� Form N-1A prospectuses is being revised to reflect the SEC�s July 30, 2010 guidance but not all of the prospectuses have been updated since the guidance was issued.��Consistent with the Registrant�s response to Comment #2, where the derivatives disclosure in a Target or Acquiring Fund�s Form N-1A prospectus has been updated, the Registrants will ensure such updates are reflected in the comparative risk discussion in the N-14.��In circumstances where the Form N-1A disclosure has not
yet been updated to reflect the Staff�s guidance, the Registrants respectfully request to keep the disclosure in the N-14 regarding a Fund�s risks consistent with the current N-1A disclosure to avoid confusion in the marketplace and among shareholders.


5.�����������Comment:��Please reformat the expense example tables in each N-14 so that the example includes two separate tables, one reflecting expenses with redemption and one reflecting expenses without redemption.��Please also delete the portions of the captions that explain what the assumptions are, i.e. whether the expenses reflect redemption of shares, as this information should be included in the heading before each table.


Response:��The Registrants respectfully decline the Staff�s request to reformat the expense example into separate tables in this round of N-14 filings. �The Registrants believe the current format provides shareholders a single-page view to compare shareholder expenses with and without redemptions. �Additionally, Invesco, as recently as January 11, 2010, filed a N-14 with a consolidated expense example. �As the Staff did not take issue with the format in that filing, Invesco believed this was an appropriate format to disclose this data. �Bifurcating the expense table may result in the tables appearing on separate pages in the proxy statement/prospectus and make it more difficult for shareholders of a particular Target Fund to view the data relevant to their Fund. �In addition, the change would
require significant reformatting of these tables across 32 separate N-14s, which would significantly increase the risk of error in the tables.� Invesco will take under advisement in any future N-14 filings the Staff�s preference that the expense example tables be bifurcated.


6.�����������Comment:��Under the caption �Summary of Key Information�How do the Funds� purchase and redemption procedures, distribution policies and exchange policies compare?� you state that the �sales charges, sales charge exemptions, distribution and servicing arrangements, purchase and redemption procedures and exchange policies for each class of the Target Fund are generally similar to those of the corresponding class of the Acquiring Fund.���Please clarify what �generally similar� means.��If these policies/procedures are not similar, please describe any differences.
�


�

� 




Response:��The disclosure has been revised to further clarify the similarities and differences between the purchase and redemption procedures, distribution policies and exchange policies of the Target and Acquiring Funds.




Specific comments � AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector Funds) N-14:


Proxy Statement/Prospectus � Invesco Utilities Fund (Acquiring Fund)


7.�����������Comment:��Note that the general comments made to the N-14s also apply to this proxy statement/prospectus.


Response:��The general comments have been incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus, as applicable.


8.�����������Comment:��The fee table indicates that the Target Fund�s expenses are increasing as a result of the Reorganization.��Please state clearly in a prominent place in the proxy statement/prospectus that expenses are increasing.


Response:��The requested disclosure will be added in the first paragraph in the �How do the Funds� expenses compare?� section of the proxy statement/prospectus.


9.�����������Comment:��The footnote to the fee table indicates that the pro forma fees are estimated as if the Reorganization had been completed as of May 1, 2009.��Why are the pro forma figures not as of a more recent date?


Response:��Pursuant to Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X and in reliance on discussion with the SEC�s accounting reviewer for the Registrants, pro forma fees were computed assuming that the transaction was consummated at the beginning of the fiscal year end of the Acquiring Fund that is reflected in the Acquiring Fund�s fee table in its current prospectus.��Therefore, when information for the Acquiring Fund is presented for a fiscal year ended in 2009 or 2010, pro forma fees were computed assuming that the Reorganization was completed at the beginning of that fiscal year, resulting in a 2008 or 2009 as of date for the pro forma figures.


10.�����������Comment:��It appears that the expense example reflects fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements for the 3, 5 and 10 year periods.��Per Form N-1A, any fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements should only be reflected for the contractual period.


Response:��The expense example reflects fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements for the contractual period, which is two years in this proxy statement/prospectus.


11.�����������Comment:��In the �Comparison of Fundamental and Non-Fundamental Investment Restrictions� section, please explain the differences between utilities industries and utilities-related industries.
�


� 


4





� 




Response:��Upon further review, it was determined that Invesco interprets �utilities� and �utilities-related� industries as encompassing the same industries.��The investment restrictions disclosure will be revised accordingly.


12.�����������Comment:��In the third paragraph under �Board Considerations in Approving the Reorganization,� please explain the basis for the statement that shareholders �may also achieve certain economies of scale� in light of the fact that total expenses will be increasing.


Response:��The statement regarding shareholders achieving economies of scale will be removed.


Proxy Statement/Prospectus � Invesco Van Kampen Small Cap Value Fund (Acquiring Fund)


13.�����������Comment:��Note that the general comments made to the N-14s also apply to this proxy statement/prospectus.


Response:��The general comments have been incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus, as applicable.


14.�����������Comment:��The first footnote to the fee table states: �The Small-Mid Special Value Fund, U.S. Small/Mid Cap Value Fund and U.S. Small Cap Value Fund are not expected to bear any Reorganization costs.���Please clarify whether shareholders of these Funds will or will not bear Reorganization costs.


Response:��The footnote will be revised to state that Target Fund shareholders �will not� bear Reorganization costs.


15.�����������Comment:��The third paragraph under �Comparison of Principal Investment Strategies� states that the Acquiring Fund will invest in �small capitalization companies.���Please explain the types of small capitalization securities in which the Acquiring Fund will invest.


Response:��The disclosure will be revised to reflect that the Acquiring Fund invests primarily in equity securities.


Proxy Statement/Prospectus � Invesco Van Kampen Comstock Fund (Acquiring Fund)


16.�����������Comment:��Note that the general comments made to the N-14s also apply to this proxy statement/prospectus.


Response:��The general comments have been incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus, as applicable.
�


� 


5





� 




17.�����������Comment:��The �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� section indicates that not all of the Target Funds have market risk.��Please explain.


Response:��The disclosure will be revised to reflect that all Target Funds are subject to market risk.


18.�����������Comment:��The �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� section indicates that the Acquiring Fund and Value II Fund do not have counterparty risk although they do invest in derivatives.��Please explain.


Response:��The disclosure will be revised to reflect that counterparty risk applies to the Acquiring Fund and Value II Fund.


19.�����������Comment:��The �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� section indicates that Basic Value Fund is not subject to common stock and other equity securities risk.��Please explain.


Response:��The disclosure will be revised to reflect that Basic Value Fund is subject to common stock and other equity securities risk.


20.�����������Comment:��The �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� section indicates that the Acquiring Fund does not have leverage risk although it does invest in derivatives.��Please explain.


Response:��The disclosure has been revised to reflect that the Acquiring Fund is subject to leverage risk.


Proxy Statement/Prospectus��� Invesco Van Kampen Value Opportunities Fund (Acquiring Fund)


21.�����������Comment:��Note that the general comments made to the N-14s also apply to this proxy statement/prospectus.


Response:��The general comments have been incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus, as applicable.


22.�����������Comment:��Regarding discussions with the SEC�s Office of the Chief Accountant regarding survivorship issues, please act as if you have also received those comments related to survivorship from the Division of Investment Management with regards to any mergers that involve a small fund absorbing a large fund.
�
�


� 


6





� 




Response:��The Registrants have taken this comment under advisement and will make any necessary disclosure changes as a result of conversations with the Office of the Chief Accountant regarding survivorship issues.




Specific comments��� AIM Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds) N-14:


Proxy Statement/Prospectus � Invesco Developing Markets Fund (Acquiring Fund)


23.�����������Comment:��Note that the general comments made to the N-14s also apply to this proxy statement/prospectus.


Response:��The general comments have been incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus, as applicable.


24.�����������Comment:��In the �Comparison of Principal Investment Strategies� section, please explain whether there is any difference between developing and emerging market countries.


Response:��There is no difference between emerging and developing market countries.��The disclosure has been revised to reflect that both the Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund consider emerging market countries to be those countries which are not included in the MCSI World Index.


25.�����������Comment:��The �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� section indicates that derivatives risk is not a principal risk of the Acquiring Fund although the Acquiring Fund appears to invest in derivatives.��Please explain.


Response:��The proxy statement/prospectus has been revised to indicate that derivatives risk is a principal risk of the Acquiring Fund.


26.�����������Comment:��Please explain supplementally why Invesco is paying the Reorganization costs for some Reorganizations, while the Target Fund(s) are paying the Reorganization costs for other Reorganizations.


Response:��Invesco proposed to each Registrant�s Board of Trustees, and the Board of Trustees approved, that each Target Fund bear its Reorganization expenses to the extent that the Target Fund shareholders would recoup these expenses within a certain period of time through reduced expenses resulting from the Reorganization.��In cases where Target Fund shareholders would not benefit from reduced expenses, Invesco agreed to bear the Reorganization costs of the Target Fund.��In addition, Invesco will bear the Reorganization costs of any Target Fund where the Target Fund is subject to an existing expense limitation arrangement and the Reorganization expenses exceed the expense caps.

Proxy Statement/Prospectus � Invesco Pacific Growth Fund (Acquiring Fund)


27.�����������Comment:��Note that the general comments made to the N-14s also apply to this proxy statement/prospectus.


Response:��The general comments have been incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus, as applicable.


28.�����������Comment:��In the �Comparison of Principal Investment Strategies� section, please highlight how the strategies of the Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund are different other than geographically.


Response:��The disclosure will be revised to further highlight the differences in the Funds� investment strategies.


29.�����������Comment:��In the �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� section, please consider whether emerging markets risk should be added as a principal risk of the Acquiring Fund.


Response:��The disclosure under �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� has been revised to include emerging markets risk as a principal risk of the Acquiring Fund.


30.�����������Comment:��In the �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� section, please consider whether derivatives risk, small capitalization risk and debt-related risks should be added as principal risks of the Acquiring Fund and/or Target Fund.


Response:��The disclosure under �Comparison of Principal Risks of Investing in the Funds� has been revised to include derivatives risk for both Funds, and fixed-income securities risks for the Acquiring Fund.��Neither the Target Fund nor the Acquiring Fund invest principally in small-capitalization issuers.


31.�����������Comment:��This transaction involves the merger of a fund that primarily invests in one country with a developed market into a fund that primarily invests in a broader geographic region with developing markets.��These funds do not seem similar.��Please explain supplementally why these funds are being merged.


Response:��Management determined that the Reorganization was the best available option for shareholders of the Invesco Japan Fund.� The proposed reorganization offers a tax free transaction for shareholders, which would not be the case had the Invesco Japan Fund been liquidated.� If approved, shareholders of the Invesco Japan Fund will be in a larger fund, with a lower total expense ratio. �Additionally, while we recognize your point that the risk profile of the funds could differ, as the Invesco Pacific Growth Fund has developing markets securities risk and the Invesco Japan Fund does not, Management believes these funds are comparable. �The Invesco Pacific Growth Fund, pursuant to its prospectus, is permitted to invest more than 25% of its net assets in Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South
Korea and/or Taiwan. �As of the July 31, 2010 statement of investments filed on Form N-Q for the fund, 44.3% of the Fund�s holdings were Japanese securities.

Response:��The disclosure under �Comparison of Principal Investment Strategies� has been revised to explain how the Target Fund uses foreign forward currency exchange contracts.


40.�����������Comment:��The �Costs of the Reorganization� section includes the following sentence:���Where the Target Fund is not paying Reorganization costs, Invesco Advisers will bear these costs.���Please explain what costs the Target Fund will not pay.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Fact Sheet








 About risk
			 


Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility, political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.
Energy Sector Risk. The Fund will concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers engaged primarily in energy-related industries. Changes in worldwide energy prices, exploration and production spending, government regulation, world events, economic conditions, exchange rates, transportation and storage costs and labor relations can affect companies in the energy sector. In addition, these companies are at an increased risk of civil liability and environmental damage claims, and are also subject to the risk of loss from terrorism and natural disasters.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Small- and Mid-Capitalization Risks. Small- and mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, may have little or no operating history or track record of success, and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.
