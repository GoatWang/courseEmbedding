Overview
In 1776, Georgia's population was around 40,000. Today, it's ranked tenth among the states with a population of 8.6 million. Growth isn't the only interesting feature about the Peach State; from ancient mountains to rolling rivers, charming towns to the bustling metropolis of Atlanta, Georgia offers plenty of features to attract newcomers on the search for apartment rentals.
What to Expect

Georgia's economy peaked in the 19th century due to its vast cotton and rice plantations fueled by slave labor, which made it one of the wealthiest Southern states. The Civil War and its aftermath were major turning points in the economic and social life of Georgia. The state was devastated during the war, and the abolition of slavery made an enormous impact on the economy. However, in recent decades, manufacturing and service industries have instituted a resurgence in the state's economy, making employment and apartments more plentiful.
The weather is generally mild in much of the state, with hot and humid summers and cool winters, with temperatures only dropping to the 40s and 50s. And as for snow? Snowfall is rare except in the mountains.
Where to Explore

Residents and tourists alike enjoy Georgia's many historical sites and natural attractions throughout the state. Scenic mountains, lakes, rivers and coastal areas provide a wide range of outdoor activities. There are also many historic sites of interest in Georgia, most of them associated with the elegant plantation lifestyle of antebellum days, as well as the Civil War.
Atlanta Apartments

Atlanta, the largest city in the state, is often considered the capital of the South. With a population of 416,000 and rising, the city's growth is matched by rapid economic expansion. "Hotlanta" houses the headquarters of some of the largest and best-known companies in the nation, including Coca-Cola, United Parcel Service, Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Turner Broadcasting System and Delta Air Lines. Tall buildings and busy streets are to be found at Five Points, the city's historic business center. Away from the hustle and bustle, you can still find charming neighborhoods (some even with apartments available), tree-shaded streets and friendly communities. Average apartment rentals cost $931 with utilities at $93, putting it on par with apartments for rent in cities like Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
Columbus Apartments

Located 95 miles southwest of Atlanta, Columbus is Georgia's second largest city with 186,000 residents. Fort Benning, a large United States Army infantry base, is nearby, which contributes to Columbus's strong military and patriotic culture. It's 7.4% cheaper to live in Columbus than in Atlanta, a feature that may come in handy when looking for apartments there.
Savannah Apartments

Savannah, with a population of 131,000, was the largest city in Georgia until Atlanta overtook it in the 20th century. A thriving industrial center and seaport, Savannah is the oldest city in the state and has retained much of the culture of its gracious past, retaining its sense of Southern charm and old-fashioned hospitality. World-class restaurants, Civil War forts, art galleries, fine antique shops and other attractions make Savannah a terrific place to call home. From elegant homes in the historic Gardens District to modern apartments for rent close to downtown, housing options are plentiful.Rent.com is a free rental site that offers a large selection of trusted apartments and houses for rent.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
