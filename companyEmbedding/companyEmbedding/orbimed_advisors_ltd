About Us


From biopharmaceuticals to medical devices, diagnostics, and healthcare services, OrbiMed is scouting the globe for innovations that will help ensure humanity lives healthier, longer and more productive lives.
 We have been investing globally for over 20 years across the healthcare industry: from early-stage private companies to large multinational corporations. Our team of over 80 distinguished scientific, medical, investment and other professionals manage approximately $13 billion across public and private company investments worldwide.



 

Life Sciences Focus
The global healthcare industry sits at the intersection of several powerful long-term growth trends led by global demographics and the ineluctable advance of scientific innovation in treating disease. These trends have caused a steady increase in the level of healthcare spending in the industrialized world, led by the U.S. which now spends over 17% of its GDP on healthcare. The healthcare industry's powerful growth profile coupled with its magnitude and complexity create myriad investment opportunities.




Our Strategies
OrbiMed invests across the global healthcare industry, from seed-stage venture capital to large publicly-traded companies. Investments are made in one of three strategies: public equity, private equity, and royalty opportunities. 


Public Equity
OrbiMed manages a series of public equity funds, including long/short event-driven funds and closed-end investment trusts. We invest across all types of publicly-traded companies, from biopharmaceuticals to medical devices and healthcare services worldwide.

Private Equity
OrbiMed's private equity strategy is broad and flexible, investing from start-ups through growth equity. OrbiMed is typically a lead investor, seeking to help build our portfolio companies. Our geographic focus includes North America, Asia, Europe and Israel.

Royalty Opportunities
OrbiMed provides commercial-stage healthcare companies with non-dilutive structured debt capital. Additionally, OrbiMed can monetize royalty streams, providing valuable financing solutions to owners of intellectual property.

The fund tends to focus on pharmaceutical and medical device companies as opposed to hospitals and insurers- products, one might say, as opposed to services.The nature of healthcare investments requires Orbimed Advisors to take on significant regulatory risks and make sure they are up to date on major announcements and other events which can have an enormous impact on an individual stock’s price. Of course, the fund also has to ensure that its analysts understand the regulatory environment as well as the science behind a company’s product line. Samuel Isaly himself has been covering healthcare for over 40 years, roughly half of which has come as an investment manager and half of which came as an analyst for companies such as Chase Manhattan , Merrill Lynch, and Legg Mason.Orbimed Advisors’ grand strategy is to run a portfolio that is more or less balanced between large healthcare companies and smaller-cap companies where the investment team believes that future growth is not being reflected in the current price. When we look at its most recent portfolio, we see a fairly small number of positions worth over $100 million and then a fairly broad range of healthcare stocks. In addition, while there were some large increases or decreases many of Orbimed’s top picks remained the same and we’d assume that most of them are still close to the top of the portfolio.
