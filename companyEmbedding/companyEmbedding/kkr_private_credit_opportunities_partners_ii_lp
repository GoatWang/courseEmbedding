NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the final closing 
      of KKR Lending Partners II L.P. (“KKRLP II” or the “Fund”), a $1.34 
      billion fund focused primarily on privately-originated senior loans. 
      KKRLP II is the successor fund to KKR Lending Partners I L.P. (“KKRLP 
      I”), which exited its investment period in December 2014.
    


      The Fund, for which KKR began soliciting third party capital in 2014, 
      received strong backing from a diverse group of new and existing 
      investors, including public pensions, insurance companies, private 
      banking platforms, family offices and individual investors.
    

      Commenting on KKRLP II, Erik Falk, Co-Portfolio Manager of the Fund, 
      said, “We are very pleased that we were able to attract a nice mix of 
      new and existing KKR direct lending investors to the Fund. We have a 
      strong pipeline and are very optimistic about the opportunity set.”
    

      KKR’s Direct Lending platform is part of KKR’s $26.9 billion credit 
      business. The Direct Lending strategy invests in privately-negotiated 
      transactions with a focus on the top of a company’s capital structure, 
      seeking to capture the illiquidity premium in order to earn strong 
      risk-adjusted returns versus the syndicated loan market.
    

      Chris Sheldon, Co-Portfolio Manager for KKRLP II, added: “The lending 
      landscape is being reshaped by a variety of factors, including 
      geopolitical change, macroeconomic factors, and the regulatory 
      environment – and we believe we are well positioned to drive 
      high-quality, originated deal flow for our direct lending business.”
    

      KKRLP II held its first close in June 2014 and began investing shortly 
      thereafter. Prior to raising the Fund, KKR’s team primarily invested 
      Direct Lending capital through KKRLP I and through separate accounts on 
      behalf of large institutional clients. Inclusive of the capital raised 
      for KKRLP II, the credit team is managing approximately $5 billion in 
      capital available for direct lending today.
