Supreme Court of Virginia.
HYUNDAI MOTOR COMPANY, LTD., et al. v. Keith Allen DUNCAN, Individually and as Guardian and Conservator for Zachary Gage Duncan, et al.
Record No. 140216.
    Decided: January 08, 2015

		Present: LEMONS, C.J., MILLETTE, MIMS, McCLANAHAN, and POWELL, JJ ., and RUSSELL and LACY, S.JJ.
In this products liability action, Hyundai Motor Company, Ltd., and Hyundai Motor America, Inc. (Hyundai) appeal from a judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of Keith Allen Duncan and Vanessa Duncan, Guardians and Conservators for Zachary Gage Duncan (Gage), and Keith Allen Duncan and Vanessa Duncan, Individually.1 Hyundai contends the circuit court erred in admitting the opinion testimony of the Duncans' designated expert witness, who testified that the location of the side airbag sensor in the 2008 Hyundai Tiburon being driven by Gage when he sustained injuries in a single-vehicle accident rendered the Tiburon unreasonably dangerous. We agree and will reverse the judgment of the circuit court.I. BACKGROUNDGage sustained a serious closed-head injury while driving his 2008 Hyundai Tiburon when he lost control of the vehicle, causing the vehicle to leave the road, strike two snow banks and a large bale of hay, before ultimately colliding with a tree on the driver's side of the vehicle. Although the Tiburon was equipped with a side airbag system, the airbag did not deploy.The Duncans brought an action against Hyundai, which manufactured and distributed the 2008 Tiburon being driven by Gage, and initially asserted claims for negligence, failure to warn, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and breach of express warranties. At trial, the Duncans pursued only their claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability in which they assert that the “Tiburon was defective, unreasonably dangerous, was not fit for the ordinary purpose for which it was intended, and did not pass without objection in the industry in which it was sold.” Specifically, the Duncans contend that if the sensor for the side airbag system had been placed in a different location, the airbag would have deployed and prevented Gage's injury.II. Expert Testimony of Design DefectTo support their claim, the Duncans designated Geoffrey Mahon (Mahon), a mechanical engineer, as an expert in airbag design to testify that the 2008 Hyundai Tiburon was defectively designed. Mahon expressed the opinion that if Hyundai had located the sensor for the side airbag system on the B-pillar of the vehicle (the pillar where the front door closes), approximately 4 to 6 inches from the floor, instead of on the cross-member underneath the driver's seat, the side airbag would have deployed. Therefore, according to Mahon, the location of the side airbag sensor on the cross-member rendered the 2008 Tiburon unreasonably dangerous.A. Motion in LiminePrior to trial, Hyundai moved to exclude Mahon's opinions as having an insufficient foundation because Mahon did not conduct any analysis to determine whether the side airbag would have deployed if the sensor had been located where Mahon proposed.When deposed, Mahon testified that in reaching his opinion, he relied upon a computer-aided engineering study conducted by Hyundai in 1999 in which Hyundai analyzed 14 potential locations for the side airbag sensor, including a location on the B-pillar that was 10 to 12 inches from the floor.2 Mahon did not adopt any of the 14 locations analyzed by Hyundai for his placement of the side airbag sensor, but determined that a location on the B-pillar approximately 4 to 6 inches from the floor “would be [his] first choice.” He further explained that since Hyundai did not analyze the location he proposed, he would “have to run tests to verify that that's just the right location, but based on [Hyundai's] evidence of the somewhat higher B-pillar location, that looks very promising.”While Mahon believed the best location for the sensor was at the B-pillar, he testified he did no testing to determine if the side airbag would have deployed in Gage's accident had the sensor been placed at any other location.Q ․ Have you done any test or calculation to show that some other sensing system location if used in the Duncan Tiburon would have caused the side air bag to fire in this crash?A I have not done any tests, I think as I indicated earlier, nor have I done any serious calculations. What I've done is look at the signal at the B-pillar and the signal at the location and concluded that I got a much more robust and timely signal at the B-pillar.(Emphasis added.) The circuit court denied Hyundai's motion to exclude Mahon's testimony, and he was permitted to express his opinions at trial, over Hyundai's objections.3 B. Trial TestimonyAt trial, Mahon testified that Hyundai was not required under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) to install a side-impact airbag system in the 2008 Tiburon, and that the 2008 Tiburon would have complied with the FMVSS for side impact protection without any side airbag system.4 Nevertheless, according to Mahon, if a manufacturer decides to put in an airbag system and “tell people there's a safety system in this car that's going to work a certain way and then it doesn't work? It's got to work. I mean, that's just improper.”Mahon's initial impression of the airbag system was that “the airbag should have gone off,” but upon further investigation, he concluded that the system was acting as designed “so this indicates that it was designed improperly, because this is a crash where you really need an airbag.” Mahon agreed that the 2008 Tiburon, with the side airbag system, complied with FMVSS 214, the standard specifically related to side impact protection. He further acknowledged that the 2008 Tiburon “did reasonably well” when Hyundai conducted 22 crash tests in which it ran the vehicle into different types of barriers, at different speeds and angles, with the side airbag sensor located on the cross-member underneath the driver's seat.5 In Mahon's opinion, however, the side airbag would have deployed in Gage's accident if the sensor for the side airbag system had been located on the B-pillar, approximately 4 to 6 inches from the floor. According to Mahon, this was true even though the sensor on the cross-member underneath the driver's seat was closer to the point of impact than it would have been if the sensor had been located in the B-pillar because Hyundai's 1999 location study showed that there was a much better signal on the B-pillar.6 In Mahon's view, therefore, the 2008 Tiburon was defectively designed and unreasonably dangerous because the sensor for the side airbag system was not located on the B-pillar.Consistent with his deposition testimony, Mahon testified at trial that he did not perform an analysis to determine whether the side airbag in the 2008 Tiburon would have deployed if the sensor was in a different location but relied upon the results of the location study undertaken by Hyundai in 1999. Mahon conceded that the location on the B-pillar considered by Hyundai was located 10 to 12 inches from the floor, and he had no data demonstrating the performance of a sensor located on the B-pillar 4 to 6 inches from the floor. He further agreed that because the airbag system must work quickly, that is the sensor system must decide within 15 milliseconds of a crash event whether an airbag is required and then inflate the airbag in 15 to 50 milliseconds, the location of the sensor is important to the overall crash sensing system such that inches, and even increments smaller than inches, matter in the determination of the location of the sensor.Though Mahon testified that the vehicle's crash sensing system is “a combination of the structure of the vehicle, the sensors themselves, and then any algorithm ․ working together to make a decision whether or not this event is worthy of an airbag,” he acknowledged that he had not performed any tests to determine whether any different sensor location, structure, or mathematical algorithm would have caused the side airbag to deploy in Gage's crash.Q Have you done any test or calculation to show that some other side sensor location if used in the Duncan Tiburon would have caused the side airbag to fire in this crash?A Based on my industry experience, my analysis says yes. Have I done a calculation? No.Q Have you done any test? A Of course not.Q ․ Have you done any test or calculation to show that some other structure, if used in the Duncan Tiburon, would have caused the side airbag to fire in this crash?A. Haven't done it.Q Have you done any test or calculation to show that some other algorithm, if used in the Duncan Tiburon, would have caused the side airbag to fire in this crash?A Well, in fact I think it would. I haven't done that work.(Emphasis added.) Relying instead on his “industry experience,” Mahon testified that the data in Hyundai's location study “spoke to [him] ․ [a]s one skilled in the art.”III. ANALYSISOn appeal, Hyundai argues there was an insufficient foundation for Mahon's opinion that the location of the sensor for the side airbag system rendered the 2008 Tiburon unreasonably dangerous.7 Expert opinion may be admitted to assist the fact finder if such opinion satisfies certain requirements, “including the requirement of an adequate factual foundation.” Forbes v. Rapp, 269 Va. 374, 381, 611 S.E.2d 592, 596 (2005); see Va.Code §§ 8.01–401.1 and –401.3; Va. R. Evid. 2:702 and 2:703; Countryside Corp. v. Taylor, 263 Va. 549, 553, 561 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2002). Since we review the circuit court's evidentiary rulings using an abuse of discretion standard, we will reverse the circuit court's decision to admit evidence only upon a finding of abuse of that discretion. John Crane, Inc. v. Jones, 274 Va. 581, 590, 650 S.E.2d 851, 855 (2007). A circuit court, though, “has no discretion to admit clearly inadmissible evidence.” Harman v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 288 Va. 84, 92, 758 S.E.2d 515, 520 (2014).As we have stated, “[q]ualification of an expert witness does not insure admission of his every statement and opinion.” Swiney v. Overby, 237 Va. 231, 233, 377 S.E.2d 372, 374 (1989). While Code § 8.01–401.1 allows an expert to express an opinion without initially disclosing the basis for the opinion, “[w]e have never, however, construed that section to permit the admission of expert testimony that lacks evidentiary support.” Vasquez v. Mabini, 269 Va. 155, 159, 606 S.E.2d 809, 811 (2005). Expert opinion must be premised upon assumptions that have a sufficient factual basis and take into account all relevant variables.“Expert testimony founded upon assumptions that have no basis in fact is not merely subject to refutation by cross-examination or by counter-experts; it is inadmissible. Failure of the trial court to strike such testimony upon a motion timely made is error subject to reversal on appeal. Furthermore, expert testimony is inadmissible if the expert fails to consider all the variables that bear upon the inferences to be deduced from the facts observed.”CNH America LLC v. Smith, 281 Va. 60, 67, 704 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2011) (quoting Vasquez, 269 Va. at 160, 606 S.E.2d at 811).Mahon's opinion that the 2008 Tiburon was unreasonably dangerous was premised upon his assumption that the side airbag would have deployed if the sensor had been located on the vehicle's B-pillar. Yet, as Mahon readily conceded, he did not perform any analysis or calculations to support this assumption. In fact, Mahon admitted that the crash sensing system depends upon a combination of the structure of the vehicle, the sensors themselves, and any algorithm, but he did not perform any tests to determine whether a different sensor location, structure, or algorithm would have caused the side airbag to deploy in Gage's crash. Furthermore, despite his testimony that inches, and even increments smaller than inches, matter when choosing the sensor location, his proposed location was more than four inches from any location studied by Hyundai.In short, Mahon's opinion that the 2008 Tiburon was unreasonably dangerous was without sufficient evidentiary support because it was premised upon his assumption that the side airbag would have deployed if the sensor was at his proposed location—an assumption that clearly lacked a sufficient factual basis and disregarded the variables he acknowledged as bearing upon the sensor location determination. Although experts may extrapolate opinions from existing data, a circuit court should not admit expert opinion “which is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.” General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997) (decided under the version of Fed.R.Evid. 702 which the General Assembly adopted, verbatim, in current Code § 8.01–401.3(A)). Mahon's opinion that the vehicle was unreasonably dangerous was based on his ipse dixit assumption that the side airbag would have deployed in Gage's crash if the sensor had been located on the B-pillar. But the “analytical gap” between the data Mahon relied upon from Hyundai's location study and the opinion he proffered was “simply too great.” Id. Therefore, Mahon's opinion was inadmissible, and the circuit court abused its discretion in admitting it.The Duncans relied upon Mahon's opinion that the 2008 Tiburon was unreasonably dangerous to satisfy their burden of proving that Hyundai breached its implied warranty of merchantability.8 As we have concluded, however, Mahon's opinion was premised upon his unfounded assumption that the side airbag would have deployed if the sensor had been located on the B-pillar of the vehicle instead of on the cross-member underneath the driver's seat.9 Because Mahon's opinion supplied the only support for the Duncans' claim that the vehicle was unreasonably dangerous, the inadmissibility of Mahon's opinion as a matter of law is fatal to the Duncans' claim and entitles Hyundai to judgment as a matter of law.IV. CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court and enter final judgment for Hyundai.Reversed and final judgment.I disagree with majority's conclusion that the opinion of Geoff Mahon, the plaintiff's expert, lacked an adequate foundation and should have been struck. In my opinion, the majority reaches this conclusion by improperly focusing on Mahon's preferred location for the side airbag sensor, even though it is clear that he did not base his conclusion on this preferred location. In so doing, the majority fails to view Mahon's testimony in the light most favorable to the Duncans, the prevailing party below. See Dagner v. Anderson, 274 Va. 678, 681, 651 S.E.2d 640, 641 (2007) (viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below when reviewing whether the trial court erred in allowing expert testimony).On direct examination Mahon clearly relied on the findings of Hyundai's 1999 location study and his calculations from the crash severity analysis to determine that the airbag would have deployed if the sensor was in the specific location1 on the B-pillar that Hyundai tested in the 1999 location study (hereafter referred to as the “B-pillar Location”). According to Mahon, the 1999 location study indicated that the signal received by the cross member had “less amplitude” and was “later than at the more outboard location such as the sill and the B-pillar. Or even the door.” Indeed, he goes on to specifically state that “Hyundai's own location study ․ show[s] that you get a much better signal on the B-pillar than you do on the cross member.” Furthermore, the crash severity analysis indicated that the G-forces generated by the impact in this case were significantly higher than the threshold Hyundai established for triggering an airbag. Specifically, he calculated that the impact in the present case generated approximately 7.2 Gs, whereas Hyundai's own data indicated that it wanted an airbag to deploy at 5.1 Gs or above.Using the signal strength data contained in the 1999 location study, he extrapolated that the airbag did not deploy because the sensor did not receive a strong enough signal due to its location on the cross member. Specifically, he opined that the cross member was too far “inboard” and not rigid enough to receive the necessary signal. He went on to determine that, because the B-pillar was a more rigid structure, located in the crush zone, a sensor placed there would receive a stronger signal, resulting in airbag deployment. Thus, in Mahon's expert opinion, the B-pillar Location would have resulted in airbag deployment in the present case.2 The majority, however, never addresses any of this testimony by Mahon. Indeed, notwithstanding the fact that almost all of Mahon's testimony related to sensor placement in a specific location on the B-pillar, i.e., the location on the B-pillar subject to testing in the 1999 location study, the majority characterizes this testimony as disregarding “the variables ․ bearing upon the sensor location determination.” Instead, the majority focuses on statements by Mahon relating to what he believed would be the ideal location for a side airbag sensor in the 2008 Tiburon. Specifically, the majority focuses on the testimony that Mahon believed that the ideal location for the airbag sensor would be on the B-pillar, approximately four to six inches from the floor (hereafter referred to as the “Proposed Location”).It is important to note, however, that there was no mention of the Proposed Location during Mahon's direct examination. Rather, it is on cross-examination that the idea of placing the sensor in the Proposed Location was first brought up at trial. Even then, the Proposed Location was only brought up after Hyundai's attorney confirmed that Mahon's prior testimony about the B-pillar Location was based on the 1999 location study.3 The majority also relies on Mahon's testimony where he “admits” that he had not done any tests or calculations showing that placing the sensor in another location would have resulted in the airbag deploying. In my opinion, however, this testimony is taken completely out of context. The testimony cited by the majority is clearly in reference to the Proposed Location, not the B-pillar Location studied by Hyundai. Indeed, it is particularly telling that the quoted exchange takes place immediately after the discussion of the Proposed Location. Thus, placed in the proper context, it is clear that Mahon was admitting that he had not performed any tests to determine whether the Proposed Location would have caused the side airbag to deploy in Gage's crash. Moreover, this “admission” is rebutted by Mahon's lengthy testimony about the calculations he performed as part of his crash severity analysis. With regard to the B-pillar Location, Mahon consistently maintained that, based on Hyundai's own study and his calculations in the crash severity analysis, a sensor placed on the B-pillar in the location tested by Hyundai in the 1999 location study would have deployed in this accident.“Expert testimony is inadmissible if it is speculative or founded on assumptions that have an insufficient factual basis.” John v. Im, 263 Va. 315, 320, 559 S.E.2d 694, 696 (2002). For that reason, I agree with the majority that Mahon's testimony about the Proposed Location was without sufficient foundation. However, the majority's opinion goes significantly beyond striking Mahon's testimony about the Proposed Location. Rather, the majority implies that, because Mahon, in relying on his knowledge and experience, believes a better, untested alternative potentially exists, his opinion as a whole is invalid. The majority gives no indication how the foundation of Mahon's testimony relating to the B-pillar Location is undermined by Mahon's belief that the Proposed Location may be better than any of the tested locations.4 Further, there is nothing in the record indicating that he based his testimony about the B-pillar Location on his belief that the Proposed Location may offer a better alternative to those tested in the 1999 Location Study. Nor is such a belief mutually exclusive with his testimony about the B-pillar Location. Accordingly, in my opinion, Mahon's opinion about the B-pillar Location had sufficient foundation and, therefore, the trial court did not err in allowing him to testify.That said, I would still reverse the decision of the trial court. In my opinion, the trial court erred in refusing to give Hyundai's Proposed Jury Instruction 21.5 A litigant is entitled to jury instructions supporting his or her theory of the case if sufficient evidence is introduced to support that theory and if the instructions correctly state the law. When we review the content of jury instructions, our sole responsibility ․ is to see that the law has been clearly stated. Determining whether a proffered jury instruction accurately states relevant legal principles is a question of law reviewed de novo on appeal.Smith v. Kim, 277 Va. 486, 491, 675 S.E.2d 193, 196 (2009) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).Hyundai's Proposed Jury Instruction 21 is an accurate statement of the law. Indeed, it does not inform the jury that Hyundai's compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) was dispositive. Rather, it merely provides the jury with a guide for determining whether the Tiburon was reasonably safe or unreasonably dangerous. Furthermore, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has recognized, evidence relating to a manufacturers compliance with the FMVSS is “relevant and necessary” to demonstrate a company's care in bringing a product to market. S.L.M. v. Dorel Juvenile Group, Inc., 514 Fed.Appx. 389, 392 (4th Cir.2013) (approving a similar instruction relating to a different FMVSS standard). Therefore, I would reverse the trial court's judgment based upon its refusal to give Hyundai's Proposed Jury Instruction 21 and remand the case for retrial.OPINION BY Justice ELIZABETH A. McCLANAHAN.

The Way of Wire

Posted on May 1, 2012 By joe 

By Kevin Beller

Seymour Duncan’s VP of Engineering & New Product Development explains how this crucial component shapes your sound.

 

There aren’t many parts in a traditional guitar pickup: magnets, wire, and a bobbin or coil former to hold them together. But these simple components form a complex interactive system, one in which small variations in materials can have a huge impact on your sound.
Take wire, for example. During my 33 years at Seymour Duncan, we’ve spent countless hours listening to and documenting how different types of wire affect a pickup’s sound. The gauge (or size) of the wire, its insulation type and thickness, the purity and suppleness of the copper — they all influence the tone in subtle yet important ways.
Pickup wire is as fine as a hair on your head.
The thick and thin of it. We use a wide variety of wire gauges in our pickups, most frequently in the 41 to 44 AWG range. This wire usually starts out as a big, heavy spool of 6-gauge wire as thick around as your pinky. They draw it through metal dies again and again until it’s approximately the thickness of a hair on your head.
Over the years we have determined which gauges are most conducive to certain tone categories. Here’s an example: Two pickups can have an identical number of turns and identical magnets. But by using a different gauge of wire, we can make one a little fatter sounding while having a smoother on the top end.
Aside from tonal considerations, we sometimes choose a thinner wire for space reasons. The more winds a pickup has, the hotter the output, so if you’re winding a pickup that has to be very compact, that may call for finer-gauge wire. For example, a customer who had some challenging requirements for a custom Dobro pickup recently approached us. He wanted the output as high as possible, but the overall height could not exceed 0.210”. Using a fairly fine gauge of magnet wire and a special magnetic structure, we were able to create a powerful and very compact pickup that could slide into the tight space beneath the strings. We’ve done numerous custom guitar pickups with similar challenges. 
Different insulation materials yield types different tones.
About insulation. There are at least 18 different types of wire insulation. There are polyurethanes, nylons, poly-nylons, polyester, and Teflon, to name a few. The insulation has a major effect on a pickup’s sound, and over the years we’ve learned how to use different types of insulation to refine a pickup’s tonal response. For example, we often use wire with heavier insulation to maintain more high-end detail.
While not strictly a type of insulation, bondable wires are also available. These have an adhesive overcoat that can be activated by heat or chemicals. With proper tooling, it’s possible to wind freestanding coils without having to use a bobbin structure of any sort. This can be useful in certain specialized applications, but we have avoided bondable wires because the winding and layering characteristics are inferior to conventional magnet wire.
The right stuff.Whatever the wire type, we use vendors who care as much about quality as we do, and we don’t mind paying extra to obtain wire that exceeds industry-standard tolerances. Beyond that, we test every case of wire that comes in. We measure the overall thickness to make sure it’s within spec, and we measure the resistance per foot down to three decimal places.
We measure all wire for consistent thickness and resistance.
Of course, we use period-accurate wire in all our vintage-style pickups. One popular vintage-style insulation is Formvar, which was used on old Strats and on some Jazz Bass pickups. But the insulation vintage buffs know best is plain enamel, with its blackish-purple coating. Plain enamel wire was common in the ’50s and into the ’60s before the new insulations had been invented. It was used in all the old Gibson P.A.F.s, and many of the earlier Fender instruments.  We use plain enamel wire in such pickups as the STL-1 and STR-1 Tele pickups, vintage-style PAFs like the ’59 model and Seth Lover, many Antiquity models, and of course on many Custom Shop models.
Plain enamel wire must be sanded prior to soldering.
Finding quality enamel wire. Today there is little demand for plain enamel wire — except for those of us who are passionate about tone.  You have to sand the wire by hand before you can solder it, and not many companies want to add that extra labor. As a result, there are only a few companies who still make true plain enamel wire.
With so few manufacturers, quality control can be a real problem. There’s one particular vendor I won’t mention whose wire is so full of voids, it’s almost unusable. Then there is a lot of wire that looks right, with that nice blackish-purple color, but it’s not even real enamel. So we buy in large quantities from a company that we have determined is the best at providing void-free, well-annealed wire. (Annealing is the process of heating and cooling the wire under controlled conditions to restore flexibility and suppleness and remove work-hardening stresses. It’s hard to wind a nice, controlled coil and get that critical layering right when the wire hasn’t been annealed properly.)
Beyond copper. We use silver in our new Zephyr pickups. Silver is the only material that has a lower DC resistance per unit length than copper.
We use silver wire in all our Zephyr pickups.
Unfortunately, it’s brutally expensive these days, but there’s a remarkable difference between the sounds of silver and copper. Pickups wound with silver wire have powerful dynamics, explosive attack, and a complex, harmonically rich sound while producing superior individual note definition and detail in chords. Silver is more supple than copper, so it winds a very nice and regular coil. I use silver when a customer requests it, or when someone wants to extend the pickups’ response at both ends of the sonic spectrum.
Not just the wire, but the way you wind it. Voicing a pickup isn’t just a matter of selecting the right wire, insulation, and number of turns — how you lay the wire is at least as important. Among other things, this determines the pickup’s distributed capacitance, which refers to the capacitor formed between the layers as the coil is wound. This property affects the resonant frequency of the coil and dictates the high-frequency roll-off point, so it’s one of the factors that let us fine-tune a pickup’s high-end response.
The winding techniques also help determine each pickup’s “voice.”
Over the years we’ve developed some very interesting ways to get a variety of tones from our pickups, whether it’s hand-winding, or precisely controlling the winding pitch on our CNC production machines. Every SD pickup, whether it’s from Custom Shop or our production floor, is designed with these considerations in mind.
Crafting the perfect pickup. Voicing a pickup is a delicate balancing act of tonality, a constant give-and-take. But thanks to all those years of listening and analysis, we can control the complex interaction of wire type and winding technique. We choose the materials and production techniques to deliver exactly the sound you’re looking for.
Kevin and Seymour in the early 80S’
A lifelong bassist, Kevin met Seymour through a local music shop where Seymour did repairs. “I used to take my Gibson bass to him all the time,” he remembers. “Like me, he was obsessed with getting the right sound.” Kevin joined the fledgling Seymour Duncan company in 1979 and became head of engineering a few years later. 
According to co-founder and longtime company president Cathy Duncan, Kevin had the right talent at the right time: “As we started growing, we needed someone with Kevin’s level of precision,” she recalls. “A lot of technical standards were pretty loose back then, but we wanted to aim higher. They say vintage pickups vary like snowflakes, which is only okay if you’re lucky enough to get one of the good ones. Thanks to Kevin’s persistence and precision, we can give musicians a perfect snowflake every time.”

FACT: I cut cheese while looking at a 41 gauge wire.
But it had a rapid dissipation. Good for all involved.

I’ve never been disappointed with Duncan’s!

Oh I have. I think they’re the most overrated brand of pickups going.

curious if very small “flat” wire has been tried
also laminated flatwire like silver and copper flat laminated by compressing at high psi…? 







Dennis Hrapeck



I love the sound of Duncan alnico2′s in an ash guitar!!







Doug Anderson



Hi Evan, nice article. I’m glad you got the Monte/Madonna experiance. It’s fun but BBQ with you in Goleta is fun for us! Thanks for all you do.

yo I cant be having some snowflake ass pickup for all this hellfire







Draytone



Great read… Has square wire ever been used I wonder? Surely that would get the most copper within a given space?







Stratofuzz



If you wanted to pack the most copper into a given space you’d be better off with hexagonal wire.  Tessellating hexagons in this way is the most efficient way to do it, hence why natural objects like honeycombs use a hexagonal structure.









Tymlaird



I’d be interested in seeing if anyone has experimented with using wire
extrusion profiles other than round, since the wire can come in square,
triangle, hex, ribbon, etc. profiles. And has anyone made pickups where
the winds lay perfectly against the next one, like in high end speaker
voice coils? Scatter winding tends to introduce distortions into the
signal, where a “perfect lay” coil would more exactly transmit the
actual sound of the string vibration, in theory. Also consider that
electricity follows a “skin effect” and tends to follow the surface of
the wire, so that a wire with a cross section shaped like a star drive
could have more surface area than a round wire, and could deliver a
stronger signal for the amount of wire used. It would also tend to have
more space between windings to introduce more of that distortion in the scatter windings.







ijams sum



Electricity has been found to travel on the surface of a conductor or wire mostly.
Hex shape is interesting to perhaps try side by side with round coils and gauge and equal turns and then check the resistance and sound for a difference in highs & lows and clarity vs not clear sounding.
High Amperage cables are now made of finer wires due to the surface travel of electricity.







sdsd



The so called “skin effect” is only happening in high-frequency applications, audio signals are not even near those freqs. About a GHz more may get you there.
The wire profile would change other things though, probably resistance and the resulting capacitance/inductance would be different, dynamically. Might be interesting to test it.
Speakers are wound like that in order to reduce air gap and thus also losses and distortion.









Damon Sasser



Is it possible to use lithium wire for winding pickups? Is lithium good for conducting a magnetic field as it does an electric? 







SeymourDuncanBlog



Actually, it has about 1/6th the conductivity of, say, copper.







Charleston Man



LITHIUM IS NOT A SAFE PRODUCT FOR SUCH USE and is HIGHLY REACTIVE TO WATER: Including HUMIDITY. Why on EARTH would you wish to use such a thing?
Read this: http://fmclithium.com/Portals/FMCLithium/Content/Docs/download/Lithium%20Metal%20Safety%20version%202.pdf
and think of a different type wire and forget Lithium.









John OConnor



Anyway you can tell me the company you use “we buy in large quantities from a company that we have determined is the best at providing void-free, well-annealed wire”







Charleston Man



Once copper wire is extruded to the point of the thickness of a human hair…a void will simply BREAK the wire. Clearly they are buying bulk copper wire from Company A and then sending it to Company B that specializes in extrusion. You should locate a company that specializes in EXTRUSION and THEY can tell you WHAT Company provided good core wire to start from.
