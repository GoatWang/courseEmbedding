Binimetinib (MEK162)Target: MEK | Indication: Melanoma and Colorectal Cancer
Introduction / Brief Description
Binimetinib is an oral small-molecule MEK inhibitor invented by Array. MEK is a key protein kinase in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which regulates several key cellular activities including proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival and angiogenesis. Inappropriate activation of this pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers, in particular through mutations in BRAF, KRAS and NRAS.
There are two Phase 3 trials with binimetinib in advanced cancer patients: COLUMBUS (encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in BRAF-mutant melanoma) and BEACON CRC [encorafenib, binimetinib and Erbitux® (cetuximab) in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer].  
In June 2017, Array submitted two NDAs to the FDA to support use of the combination of binimetinib 45 mg twice daily and encorafenib 450 mg once daily (COMBO450) for the treatment of patients with BRAF-mutant advanced, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The submissions are supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 COLUMBUS study, which showed that patients who received binimetinib and encorafenib had a significantly longer progression free survival (PFS) compared to patients receiving vemurafenib.  
COLUMBUS Results
As presented at the 2016 Society for Melanoma Research Annual Congress, results from Part 1 of the COLUMBUS study showed that COMBO450 significantly extend PFS in patients with advanced BRAF-mutant melanoma, with a PFS of 14.9 months compared with 7.3 months observed with vemurafenib [hazard ratio (HR) 0.54, (95% CI 0.41-0.71, P<0.001)]. As part of the trial design, the primary analysis was based on a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) of patient scans, while results by local review at the investigative site were also analyzed. The table below outlines the median PFS (mPFS) results, as determined by both assessments, for COMBO450 versus vemurafenib, COMBO450 versus encorafenib, and encorafenib versus vemurafenib:

In this study, COMBO450 was generally well-tolerated, with a median duration of treatment of 51 weeks and median relative dose intensity for encorafenib and binimetinib of 100% and 99.6%, respectively. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) that occurred in more than 5% of patients receiving COMBO450 were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CK) (9%), increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (7%) and hypertension (6%). The incidence of any grade of AEs of special interest, defined based on toxicities commonly associated with commercially available MEK+BRAF-inhibitor treatments for patients receiving COMBO450 included: rash (23%), pyrexia (18%), retinal pigment epithelial detachment (13%) and photosensitivity (5%).  Full safety results of COLUMBUS Part 1 were presented at the 2016 Society for Melanoma Research Annual Congress.
COLUMBUS Part 2 was designed specifically to assess the contribution of binimetinib to the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib by reducing the dose of encorafenib to 300mg in the combination arm to allow for a comparison of equal doses across arms. In COLUMBUS Part 2, the primary analysis compared PFS in patients treated with binimetinib 45mg twice daily plus encorafenib 300mg daily (COMBO300) to patients treated with encorafenib 300mg daily as a single agent.  Top-line results showed the mPFS for patients treated with COMBO300 was 12.9 months compared to 9.2 months for patients treated with single agent encorafenib, with HR of 0.77 [95% CI 0.61-0.97, p=0.029]. COMBO300 was generally well-tolerated and reported dose intensity and AEs were consistent with COMBO450 results in COLUMBUS Part 1. Further results from COLUMBUS Part 2 will be presented at the 2017 ESMO Congress.
In addition to these registration trials, early-stage studies have been initiated or announced to evaluate binimetinib in numerous solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.  Importantly, Array is collaborating with Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb to study binimetinib plus anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with microsatellite stable metastatic CRC (MSS CRC).  
BRAF-mutant Melanoma 
Metastatic melanoma is the most serious and life-threatening type of skin cancer and is associated with low survival rates. Only about 20% of people will survive for at least five years following a diagnosis with late-stage disease. There are about 200,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed worldwide each year, approximately half of which have BRAF mutations, a key target in the treatment of metastatic melanoma 
BRAF-mutant Colorectal Cancer
Worldwide, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men and the second most common in women, with approximately 1.4 million new diagnoses in 2012. Of these, nearly 750,000 were diagnosed in men, and 614,000 in women. Globally in 2012, approximately 694,000 deaths were attributed to colorectal cancer. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 135,430 patients will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2017, and approximately 50,000 are estimated to die of their disease. There is wide variation in 5-year survival rates across the globe, with 5-year survival expected to be around 65% in the developed world and dropping to around 20% in some developing countries. In the United States, BRAF mutations occur in 8 to 15 percent of patients with colorectal cancer and represent a poor prognosis for these patients.

ARRY-502Target: CRTh2 | Indication: Asthma
Introduction / Brief Description
ARRY-502 is an oral, potent and highly selective CRTh2 antagonist designed to treat patients with Th2-driven allergic diseases.  The CRTh2 receptor is expressed on Th2 T cells, basophils and eosinophils, and its ligand, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), is released by mast cells.  Results of a Phase 2 study with ARRY-502 in patients with mild to moderate Th2-driven asthma demonstrate that antagonism of the PGD2/CRTh2 axis results in significant improvements in lung function, asthma control, symptoms, and patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes.  ARRY-502 provided control of allergic inflammation and clinically meaningful benefit to these asthma patients.  Because current asthma therapies do not fully control the Th2 pathophysiology, antagonism of CRTh2 represents an exciting new approach to enhance disease control in asthma and other allergic inflammatory diseases. 
Based on its mechanism of action, ARRY-502 will provide the greatest patient benefit in a Th2 signature-enriched population.  Several baseline Th2-related biomarkers were evaluated in the Phase 2 study, including fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO).  The Th2 signature, which is present in about half of the asthma population, spans mild, moderate and severe disease and suggests broad applicability for ARRY-502 in these patients as well as in other Th2-driven diseases such as allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.  Array is seeking a partner for further development of ARRY-502. 
About Asthma
It is estimated that approximately 25 million people in the United States have asthma, causing significant morbidity and mortality.  The worldwide estimates are approximately 235 million people with 180,000 deaths annually.  Mild to moderate persistent allergic asthma represents more than 12 million patients in the U.S, and while only 10% of all asthmatics are considered severe, they are responsible for a disproportionate share of asthma-related expenditures due to frequent exacerbations that result in emergency room visits and hospitalization.  Despite the range of available asthma treatments, there remains a significant need for a convenient, safe and effective therapy for patients.  Specifically, oral medications may facilitate treatment compliance relative to inhaled and injectable therapies.

VARLITINIB (ASLAN001)Target: Pan-HER | Indication: Gastric cancer
Introduction / Brief Description
Varlintinib, a novel, oral pan-HER inhibitor, was invented by Array and licensed to ASLAN Pharmaceuticals.  Varlintinib has shown clinical activity in both HER2-positive and EGFR-positive tumors.  In early 2015, two new trials with varlintinib were initiated:   a Phase 2 trial in Asian patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior trastuzumab and a Phase 1 / 2 trial in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in Asian patients with solid tumors including HER2-positive breast cancer.  In addition, in 2014, ASLAN initiated a Phase 1b trial to evaluate safety of the combination of varlintinib with standard of car chemotherapy in patients with first line gastric cancer.  Pending appropriate results, ASLAN intends to begin a randomized Phase 2b study in gastric cancer and is exploring the use of varlintinib in other indications.
ASLAN is funding and developing varlintinib through clinical proof-of-concept. Upon achievement of proof-of-concept, ASLAN will identify a global partner for Phase 3 development and commercialization. Array will share a significant portion of the proceeds of such partnering transaction. 
Gastric cancer is a major public health problem in East Asia. Patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent disease have a poor prognosis, with an overall median survival of approximately 11 months. EGFR and HER2 receptors are commonly overexpressed together in gastric cancer. Data from pivotal studies of Herceptin® (trastuzumab), indicate that the activity of this drug is limited to the subset of patients whose disease has amplified copies of the HER2 gene. We believe ASLAN001 has the potential to augment or supersede the activity of Herceptin in this population, and in the broader population of gastric cancers that co-express both EGFR and HER2 receptors.

Ipatasertib / GDC-0068Target: AKT | Indication: Solid Tumors
Introduction / Brief Description
Ipatasertib is an AKT inhibitor invented by Array under a collaboration agreement with Genentech. Array has received certain clinical milestones and is entitled to additional potential clinical and commercial milestones and royalties on product sales under the agreement.
AKT activity is frequently elevated in cancer via multiple mechanisms, including loss of function of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene or mutations/amplifications of the PIK3CA or AKT genes. AKT pathway activation is associated with poor prognosis and may lead to resistance to chemotherapy. Ipatasertib is advancing in clinical development including a Phase 3 trial in patients with prostate cancer and three Phase 2 trials in patients with breast cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer.

ARRY-614Target: p38 / Tie2 | Indication: Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
Introduction / Brief Description
ARRY-614, a potent, small-molecule dual p38/Tie2 inhibitor, is being studied in patients with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low and intermediate-1 risk MDS.  In an initial dose-escalation study, using a powder-in-capsule formulation of ARRY-614, multi-lineage activity was observed. The most promising effects were seen in patients with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, with transfusion independence frequently observed in platelet transfusion-dependent patients.  As presented at the American Society for Hematology (ASH) meeting in December 2013, multi-lineage responses as well as platelet transfusion independence have again been observed in this study.  Array has no plans to invest internally at this time in ARRY-614.
MDS
According to an article published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2010, there were 45,000 newly diagnosed cases of MDS in the U.S. Medicare population (≥65 years) in 2003.  Currently approved therapies provide improvement of MDS-related symptoms, but many patients fail to respond to or are intolerant to therapy or progress after experiencing an initial response. As a result, there remains an unmet need for new agents in the treatment of patients with MDS.Publications

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. and BOULDER, Colo., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Array BioPharma (NASDAQ:ARRY) today announced a collaboration agreement for the discovery and development of novel drugs for autoimmune disorders. The undisclosed target and lead inhibitors were discovered through Array's proprietary platform that leverages Array's expertise in chemistry and early lead development.  
"We are pleased to enter this collaboration with Array that builds on our continued focus in inflammation, one of Amgen's key strategic areas of interest," said Flavius Martin, M.D., vice president of Research, Inflammation and Oncology at Amgen. "We look forward to partnering with Array BioPharma to advance molecules into the clinic that may offer a new treatment option for patients." 
"We look forward to collaborating with Amgen, a leader in treatments for inflammatory disease, on this exciting target which was discovered using Array's proprietary Kinase-Directed Phenotypic Screening Platform," said Nicholas A. Saccomano, Ph.D., chief scientific officer at Array BioPharma. "The identification of this novel target, along with our team's deep experience in kinase inhibitor chemistry, gives us confidence that our efforts will result in a drug which will address a significant unmet medical need for patients with inflammatory disease."
Under the terms of the agreement, Amgen and Array will collaborate on preclinical development with Array leading the medicinal chemistry work. Amgen is responsible for clinical development and commercialization. In exchange for exclusive rights to Array's preclinical program, Amgen will make upfront and milestone payments, as well as pay royalties on sales of resulting therapies. 
About AmgenAmgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.
Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.

About Array BioPharmaArray BioPharma Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule drugs to treat patients afflicted with cancer.  Eight registration studies are currently advancing related to six Array-owned or partnered drugs: binimetinib (MEK162), encorafenib (LGX818), selumetinib (partnered with AstraZeneca), danoprevir (partnered with Roche), ipatasertib (partnered with Genentech), larotrectinib (partnered with Loxo Oncology) and tucatinib (partnered with Cascadian Therapeutics).
Amgen Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen project. Amgen's results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen's products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen's research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products after they are on the market. Amgen's business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen's business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between it and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key manufacturing facilities and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen's products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen's distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen's products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen's efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies Amgen has acquired may not be successful. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all. Amgen is increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. Amgen's stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen's business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock.
Array BioPharma Forward-Looking StatementThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about the timing of the announcement of the results of clinical trials for our proprietary and our partnered programs, the timing of the completion or initiation of further development of our wholly-owned and our partnered programs, including the timing of regulatory filings, expectations that events will occur that will result in greater value for Array, the potential for the results of ongoing preclinical and clinical trials to support regulatory approval or the marketing success of a drug candidate, our ability to partner our proprietary drug candidates for up-front fees, milestone and/or royalty payments, our future plans to progress and develop our proprietary programs, our future capital requirements and the plans of our collaborators to progress and develop programs we have licensed to them, and our plans to build a late-stage development company. These statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in our most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K, in our quarterly reports filed on Form 10-Q, and in other reports filed by Array with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because these statements reflect our current expectations concerning future events, our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to continue to fund and successfully progress internal research and development efforts and to create effective, commercially-viable drugs; risks relating to the regulatory approval process for our drug candidates, which may not result in approval for our drug candidates, cause delays in development or require that we expend more resources to obtain approval than expected; risks associated with our dependence on our collaborators for the clinical development and commercialization of our out-licensed drug candidates; the ability of our collaborators and of Array to meet objectives tied to milestones and royalties; our ability to effectively and timely conduct clinical trials in light of increasing costs and difficulties in locating appropriate trial sites and in enrolling patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials; risks associated with our dependence on third-party service providers to successfully conduct clinical trials within and outside the United States; our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and maintain sufficient cash resources; the extent to which the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are willing to in-license drug candidates for their product pipelines and to collaborate with and fund third parties on their drug discovery activities; our ability to out-license our proprietary candidates on favorable terms; and our ability to attract and retain experienced scientists and management. We are providing this information as of July 18, 2017. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of events or circumstances after the date of such statements or of anticipated or unanticipated events that alter any assumptions underlying such statements.

Binimetinib (MEK162)Target: MEK | Indication: Melanoma and Colorectal Cancer
Introduction / Brief Description
Binimetinib is an oral small-molecule MEK inhibitor invented by Array. MEK is a key protein kinase in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which regulates several key cellular activities including proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival and angiogenesis. Inappropriate activation of this pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers, in particular through mutations in BRAF, KRAS and NRAS.
There are two Phase 3 trials with binimetinib in advanced cancer patients: COLUMBUS (encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in BRAF-mutant melanoma) and BEACON CRC [encorafenib, binimetinib and Erbitux® (cetuximab) in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer].  
In June 2017, Array submitted two NDAs to the FDA to support use of the combination of binimetinib 45 mg twice daily and encorafenib 450 mg once daily (COMBO450) for the treatment of patients with BRAF-mutant advanced, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The submissions are supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 COLUMBUS study, which showed that patients who received binimetinib and encorafenib had a significantly longer progression free survival (PFS) compared to patients receiving vemurafenib.  
COLUMBUS Results
As presented at the 2016 Society for Melanoma Research Annual Congress, results from Part 1 of the COLUMBUS study showed that COMBO450 significantly extend PFS in patients with advanced BRAF-mutant melanoma, with a PFS of 14.9 months compared with 7.3 months observed with vemurafenib [hazard ratio (HR) 0.54, (95% CI 0.41-0.71, P<0.001)]. As part of the trial design, the primary analysis was based on a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) of patient scans, while results by local review at the investigative site were also analyzed. The table below outlines the median PFS (mPFS) results, as determined by both assessments, for COMBO450 versus vemurafenib, COMBO450 versus encorafenib, and encorafenib versus vemurafenib:

In this study, COMBO450 was generally well-tolerated, with a median duration of treatment of 51 weeks and median relative dose intensity for encorafenib and binimetinib of 100% and 99.6%, respectively. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) that occurred in more than 5% of patients receiving COMBO450 were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CK) (9%), increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (7%) and hypertension (6%). The incidence of any grade of AEs of special interest, defined based on toxicities commonly associated with commercially available MEK+BRAF-inhibitor treatments for patients receiving COMBO450 included: rash (23%), pyrexia (18%), retinal pigment epithelial detachment (13%) and photosensitivity (5%).  Full safety results of COLUMBUS Part 1 were presented at the 2016 Society for Melanoma Research Annual Congress.
COLUMBUS Part 2 was designed specifically to assess the contribution of binimetinib to the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib by reducing the dose of encorafenib to 300mg in the combination arm to allow for a comparison of equal doses across arms. In COLUMBUS Part 2, the primary analysis compared PFS in patients treated with binimetinib 45mg twice daily plus encorafenib 300mg daily (COMBO300) to patients treated with encorafenib 300mg daily as a single agent.  Top-line results showed the mPFS for patients treated with COMBO300 was 12.9 months compared to 9.2 months for patients treated with single agent encorafenib, with HR of 0.77 [95% CI 0.61-0.97, p=0.029]. COMBO300 was generally well-tolerated and reported dose intensity and AEs were consistent with COMBO450 results in COLUMBUS Part 1. Further results from COLUMBUS Part 2 will be presented at the 2017 ESMO Congress.
In addition to these registration trials, early-stage studies have been initiated or announced to evaluate binimetinib in numerous solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.  Importantly, Array is collaborating with Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb to study binimetinib plus anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with microsatellite stable metastatic CRC (MSS CRC).  
BRAF-mutant Melanoma 
Metastatic melanoma is the most serious and life-threatening type of skin cancer and is associated with low survival rates. Only about 20% of people will survive for at least five years following a diagnosis with late-stage disease. There are about 200,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed worldwide each year, approximately half of which have BRAF mutations, a key target in the treatment of metastatic melanoma 
BRAF-mutant Colorectal Cancer
Worldwide, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men and the second most common in women, with approximately 1.4 million new diagnoses in 2012. Of these, nearly 750,000 were diagnosed in men, and 614,000 in women. Globally in 2012, approximately 694,000 deaths were attributed to colorectal cancer. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 135,430 patients will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2017, and approximately 50,000 are estimated to die of their disease. There is wide variation in 5-year survival rates across the globe, with 5-year survival expected to be around 65% in the developed world and dropping to around 20% in some developing countries. In the United States, BRAF mutations occur in 8 to 15 percent of patients with colorectal cancer and represent a poor prognosis for these patients.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
