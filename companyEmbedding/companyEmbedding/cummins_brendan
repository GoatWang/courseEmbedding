JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREStanding My Groundby Cummins, BrendanA fiercely honest and compelling autobiography from the Tipperary legend -- the greatest goalkeeper in the history of hurling.Brendan Cummins has made more senior hurling championship appearances than any other player in the history of the game. In an era that produced such brilliant goalkeeping talents as Davy Fitzgerald, Donal  g Cusack and Damien Fitzhenry, many would argue that Cummins has earned the right to be considered the greatest of them all. Following his League debut for Tipperary in November 1993, Cummins went on to play at the top of the intercounty game for 19 consecutive seasons. He won two senior All Ireland medals, five Munster championships, four League titles and five All Star awards.From fearless shot-stopping to pinpoint accuracy on his puck-outs, Cummins was unrivalled in the consistency of his performances, a consistency underpinned by a sometimes punishing physical commitment, mental discipline and great attention to detail. He was the rock upon which Tipperary built their team under many managers and changes of personnel.Brendan Cummins' story is the story of Tipperary hurling over the last two decades. The ups and downs. The dramas. The characters. From his senior championship debut in 1995 under Fr. Tom Fogarty to his final games under Eamon O'Shea, Cummins has seen it all.Standing My Ground is a remarkable account of an extraordinary career.Sports, Track & FieldCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Famous quotes containing the word products:
“The reality is that zero defects in products plus zero pollution plus zero risk on the job is equivalent to maximum growth of government plus zero economic growth plus runaway inflation.”—Dixie Lee Ray (b. 1924)
“... white people, like black ones, are victims of a racist society. They are products of their time and place.”—Shirley Chisholm (b. 1924)
“The measure discriminates definitely against products which make up what has been universally considered a program of safe farming. The bill upholds as ideals of American farming the men who grow cotton, corn, rice, swine, tobacco, or wheat and nothing else. These are to be given special favors at the expense of the farmer who has toiled for years to build up a constructive farming enterprise to include a variety of crops and livestock.”—Calvin Coolidge (18721933)
