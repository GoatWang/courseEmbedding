	Notes to Financial Statements

	NOTE 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
	BASIS OF PRESENTATION




	 



	Ehouse Global, Inc. (the “Company”)
	prepared these financial statements in accordance with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.
	GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Therefore, the
	financial statements do not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. However, the Company
	has recorded all transactions and adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.
	The adjustments made are normal and recurring. The following notes describe only the material changes in accounting policies, account
	details or financial statement notes during the first three months of 2014. Therefore, please read these financial statements and
	notes to the financial statements together with the audited financial statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form
	10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. The income statement for the six months ended June 30, 2014 cannot necessarily
	be used to project results for the full year.


	 



	NOTE 2 - BUSINESS OPERATIONS SUMMARY
	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
	statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in The United States of America and the
	rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information.  Accordingly, they
	do not include all the information necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position and results of operations.


	 


	It is management's opinion, however, that
	all material adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial
	statements presentation.  The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
	for the year.


	 



	Impact of New Accounting Standards



	 


	The Company has implemented all new accounting
	pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new
	accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.


	 



	Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
	and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
	and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Furniture and Equipment



	 


	Furniture and equipment are stated at cost,
	less accumulated depreciation.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  Depreciation
	is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of three to five years.


	 





	Derivative Liabilities



	 


	We value derivative liabilities using a
	multinomial lattice model. The model is based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model of future projections of various
	outcomes. Some of the key assumptions include the likelihood of future financing, stock price volatility, and discount rates.




	 



	Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share



	 


	Basic Net income (loss) per common share
	is computed pursuant to FASB ASC 260-10-45. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number
	of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
	average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period.

	462,355,275


	 






	 



	Subsequent Events



	 


	The Company follows the guidance in FASB
	ASC 855-10-50 for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company evaluates subsequent events from the date of the balance sheet
	through the date when the financial statements are issued or available to be issued.


	 



	NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, we have
	very limited financial resources, with working capital and net shareholder deficits and had generated no revenue through June 30,
	2014.


	 


	We have actively developed and plan to
	introduce sixteen different liquid nutritional products into the market. While we are undertaking our business plan to generate
	additional revenues, our cash position may not be sufficient to support our basic business plan and product distribution efforts.
	Management believes that the actions presently underway to introduce our products to the marketplace have a realistic chance of
	succeeding. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to increase revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds,
	there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to achieve
	profitable operations or obtain adequate financing.


	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
	in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded
	assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	NOTE 4 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The carrying amounts of the Company’s
	financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of
	the current nature of these instruments. Debt approximates fair value based on interest rates available for similar financial arrangements.
	Derivative liabilities which have been bifurcated from host convertible debt agreements are presented at fair value.


	 


	The following is the major category of
	liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, using quoted prices in active
	markets for identical liabilities (Level 1); significant other observable inputs (Level 2); and significant unobservable
	inputs (Level 3):

	NOTE 5 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT




	 



	At June 30, 2014, property and equipment
	consisted of office furniture purchased during the six months ended June 30, 2014 for $1,180 with an estimated useful life of 3
	years.


	 


	Depreciation expense for the six months
	ended June 30, 2014 totaled $147.


	 



	NOTE 6 - NOTE PAYABLE



	 


	On June 30, 2013, the Company entered into
	a senior loan agreement with Realty Capital Management Limited (the “Note”) for a loan of $100,000. The loan, which
	becomes due 365 days after cash proceeds are received by the Company, bears interest at 12% per annum with interest payable in
	four quarterly payments commencing 90 days after cash proceeds from the loan is received by the Company. The Company received the
	proceeds from the loan on July 11, 2013.


	 


	The Note is senior to all other notes or
	obligations that the Company may enter into in the future before the Note is repaid. It also places limits on the number of common
	shares or instruments convertible into common shares that the Company may issue.


	 


	The Company also agreed to issue 1,000,000
	newly-issued shares of its common stock to the lender. These shares have piggyback registration rights. These shares were issued
	on July 26, 2013 at which time there were 99,800,000 shares of common stock outstanding. The Company capitalized the $1,000 as
	debt issue costs at the time of issuance of these shares which will be amortized over the life of the debt. The valuation for this
	issuance was based on the par value of the shares issued or $0.001 per share. At the time of issuance, the Company had a stockholders’
	deficit, no shares had been purchased for cash and there was no market in the shares.


	 


	The President of the Company has pledged
	42,900,000 shares of his common stock of the Company as collateral for the loan. In the event of an Event of Default that is not
	remedied as defined in the Loan Agreement, the lender would also have the right to convert the principal balance of the loan into
	common shares of the Company at the rate of $0.001 per share (for up to 100 million shares).


	 


	If an Event of Default occurs and the lender
	converts the Note, the lender will have a controlling interest in the Company.


	 


	On January 31, 2014, the debt holder entered
	into a securities settlement agreement whereby the note was transferred over to a third party. In connection with the transfer,
	an additional $5,000 of principal was recorded which was treated as debt issue costs, interest was changed to a guaranteed 10%
	and a conversion clause was added. The conversion price equals 25% of the lowest traded price during the 20 trading days prior
	to the conversion.


	 


	The Company identified conversion features
	embedded within this convertible debt. The Company has determined that the features associated with the embedded conversion option
	should be accounted for at fair value as a derivative liability and recorded a derivative liability and derivative expense of $518,396
	on the day of the amendment - See note 5.


	 


	During the six months ended June 30, 2014,
	the Company entered into the following conversion agreements in connection with this note agreement to pay the principal and accrued
	interest in full:

	NOTE 7 - CONVERTIBLE DEBT



	 


	On November 27, 2013, the Company entered
	into an agreement whereby the Company will issue up to $53,000 in a convertible note. The note matures on August 27, 2014 and bears
	an interest rate of 8%. The conversion price equals the “Variable Conversion Price”, which is 58% of the “Market
	Price”, which is the average the three lowest closing bid prices for the common stock during the fifteen (15) trading day
	period prior to the conversion. The holder converted the principal balance of the note and most of the accrued interest to common
	shares during the second quarter of 2014. The Company received $50,000 proceeds, less debt issue costs of $3,000. As of June 30,
	2014 and December 31, 2013, the convertible note balance and accrued interest is $307 and $53,388, respectively.


	 


	During the six months ended June 30, 2014,

	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
	AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 




	Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements




	 


	Except for the historical
	information contained herein, the matters addressed in this Item 2 constitute "forward-looking statements" within
	the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed
	below under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that could cause actual results
	to differ materially from those anticipated by the Company's management. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the
	"Act") provides certain "safe harbor" provisions for forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements
	made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made pursuant to the Act. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release
	the results of any revisions to its forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date
	hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unexpected events.  The Company cautions readers that important factors may affect
	the Company’s actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made by or
	on behalf of the Company.  These factors include the Company’s lack of historically profitable operations, dependence
	on key personnel, the success of the Company’s business, ability to manage anticipated growth and other factors identified
	in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases and/or other public communications. Unless
	the context otherwise requires, the words “Ehouse,” the "Company," "we," "us" and "our"
	refer to Ehouse Global, Inc.


	 




	Reverse Merger and Spinoff




	 


	Effective June 30,
	2013, Ehouse entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) by and among (i) Ehouse (ii) NutraLiquids,
	LLC and (iii) the shareholders of NutraLiquids, pursuant to which the holders of 100% of the outstanding units of NutraLiquids
	transferred to Ehouse all of the units of NutraLiquids in exchange for the issuance of 52,000,000 shares (the “Shares”)
	of Ehouse common stock (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, NutraLiquids became a wholly-owned
	subsidiary of Ehouse.


	 


	Effective June 30,
	2013, Ehouse entered into a Spinoff Agreement with Scott Corlett, its former President and largest shareholder, under which Ehouse
	assigned and transferred to Mr. Corlett all of Ehouse’s rights, title and interest in and to the operating assets specifically
	associated with its packaging business in exchange for which Mr. Corlett agreed to assume the operating liabilities specifically
	associated with the packaging business as defined in the Agreement and return 198,000,000 shares of Ehouse’s common stock
	owned by him.


	 


	As a result of the
	Spinoff Agreement, Ehouse ceased to be a company engaged in the commercial packaging market. Ehouse’s operations are now
	conducted through NutraLiquids and primarily consist of development of and plan to sell liquid nutritional beverages.


	 


	The merger was accounted
	for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization. NutraLiquids is the acquirer for accounting purposes, and Ehouse is the issuer.
	Accordingly, NutraLiquids' historical financial statements for periods prior to the acquisition become those of the acquirer retroactively
	restated for the equivalent number of shares issued in the merger. Reported operations prior to the merger are those of NutraLiquids.
	No Ehouse operating results from prior to the merger date are included in reported financial statements of operations. Earnings
	per share for the period prior to the merger are restated to reflect the equivalent number of shares outstanding.


	 




	Operations




	 


	NutraLiquids is a
	development stage business that commenced formal operations on November 16, 2010. Prior to commencing formal operations, its President,
	Scott Corlett, and some colleagues incurred costs of approximately $500,000 to develop the idea of creating a comprehensive line
	of natural liquid dietary aids and nutritional supplements which could be packaged and sold in single serving pouches. These costs
	were incurred prior to the commencement of the formal operations and are not included in any of the Company’s financial statements.


	 


	Since commencing
	formal operations, the Company has continued developing the product line, developed marketing approaches and has located entities
	to manufacture products and packaging and distribute finished products. While no written agreements have been executed, the Company
	is confident that it has the operational structure in place.

	From a
	marketing perspective, we will emphasize large supermarket and other convenience store chains and will also sell product on the
	Internet. The emphasis since developing the product line has been to obtain sources of debt and/or equity financing to enable the

	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	There were no new

	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The preparation of
	financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
	of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.


	 


	An accounting policy
	is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly
	uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the
	accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.


	 


	Financial Reporting
	Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation
	of financial statements.  There are no critical policies or decisions that rely on judgments that are based on assumptions
	about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made.  Note 2 to the financial statements included in
	the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10K includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the
	preparation of our financial statements.

(OTCBB:EHOS), (the "Company") (www.EHouse-Global.com), a specialty nutraceutical company in the dietary supplement industry, would like to announce that it has begun formulation on a line of products derived from cannabis.EHouse Global is in the beginning stages of launching a subsidiary to produce several different products in the Company's perfected single serving pouches. The new multi-product line will be aimed at combatting pain, anxiety, nausea, among other ailments, using oil derived from cannabis.A study published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (http://m.jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/308/3/838.abstract) acknowledges the fact that cannabinoids have been shown to possess antitumor properties. This study examined the effect of cannabidiol (CBD, non psychoactive cannabinoid compound) on human glioma cell lines. The addition of cannabidiol led to a dramatic drop in the viability of glioma cells. Glioma is the word used to describe brain tumour. The study concluded that cannabidiol was able to produce a significant antitumor activity.Research conducted by the California Pacific Medical Centre and published in the US National Library of Medicine (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20859676/) has also shown that cannabidiol inhibits human breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. This study also demonstrated that CBD significantly reduces tumour mass.The cannabis oil industry is in alignment with EHouse Global's commitment to using natural substances to create supplements that aid in health.Scott Corlett, CEO of EHouse Global, stated, "This venture is an extremely personal one for us at EHouse Global, and we feel it is our duty to create accessible products for any person suffering from pain and other related ailments. After extensive research, we are extremely excited to create a new innovational line of cannabis products that could change peoples lives."About EHouse Global (EHOS)EHouse Global is a publicly traded company on the OTCBB Market stock exchange under the ticker symbol EHOS.

EHouse Global, Inc. 3rd Quarter Review 2014

SAN DIEGO, Oct. 2, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EHouse Global, Inc. (OTCBB:EHOS), (the "Company" or "EHouse") (www.EHouse-Global.com), an emerging specialty nutraceutical company with 16 liquid based nutritional products in the dietary supplement industry, is pleased to report their 3rd Quarter Review 2014 to its shareholders and prospective investors.

	As we have ended the 3rd quarter 2014, I want to report on the significant developments that are positioning us for great potential for 2015.

	In this year we have made great strides in setting up the infrastructure for the rapid deployment of our brands and products. We have solidified strong relationships in the foundational areas of Legal Representation, SEC compliance, Accounting, Auditing, Capital Providers and Investor Relations as well as the areas of Brand Acquisition, Brand Development, Product Development, Product Formulation, Manufacturing, Sales, Marketing, Distribution, Advertising, and Public Relations.

	We have a commitment that "We only work with the best" and based upon this commitment we believe that we are poised for accelerated growth. We have been very careful to choose only the best companies and service providers to enable us to be the growth company that we are committed to be.

	For our NutraLiquids brand of consumer packaged goods:

	1. We have completed the formulation development, pricing, and opening order quantities with our main provider of liquid nutritional supplements.

	2. We have finalized the details with our pouching partner regarding size, shape, boxing requirements, and opening order quantities.

	3. We have entered into a distribution agreement for our products for the retail distribution and are in final negotiations for our direct to consumer distribution.

	4. We have developed licensed products for existing popular consumer packaged goods brands and are currently in negotiations regarding the licensing and logistics of bringing them to market.

	5. We have prepared a crowd funding campaign across multiple platforms that is expected to launch in the 4th quarter of 2014.

	6. We have targeted a date of Jan. 1 2015 to begin distribution into retail and direct to consumer markets.

	We are a consumer packaged goods brand accelerator developing our own products and actively pursuing international brands that fit its business model of natural, fair trade and environmentally friendly products with a commitment to conscious capitalism.

	Some of the new brands we are working on are as follows:

	1. With the laws shifting and markets opening up across the US for the Cannabis and Medical Marijuana industry, we have begun formulating and developing products for a planned launch into the THC and CBD market. Our development of brands and products are focused on liquid delivery in this exciting space. We are in the development of liquid Anti-Inflammation products, Anti-Nausea for cancer patients, Anti-Anxiety, Sleep and many other products leveraging the medicinal properties of Cannabis. Cannabis, commonly known as marijuana and by numerous other names, is a preparation of the cannabis plant intended for use as a psychoactive drug and as medicine. Pharmacologically, the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); it is one of 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 84 other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and cannabigerol (CBG). We are extremely optimistic about our potential in this fast growing market segment with products that are focused on pain, anxiety, and relief of many common ailments.

	2. We are working with existing large international brands in the consumer packaged goods space that have a long history of established success across the globe but are not yet in the US. We are currently in licensing and manufacturing negotiations at various levels with over 5 different international brands. We are optimistic about the win/win opportunities for both companies and we see a great opportunity to leverage brands and products that have already proved successful in the international marketplace. This gives us an opportunity to quickly present large product offerings to the wholesale buyers while limiting our upfront development cost. As these brands progress in the US we also see potential in the Direct to consumer space.

	While we have accomplished a lot this year, we believe that next year will be a breakout year for us across many brands while still holding true to our principle core values of developing and providing products that are natural, fair trade, and environmentally friendly with a commitment to conscious capitalism.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
