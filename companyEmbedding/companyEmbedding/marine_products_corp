A shop selling marine souvenirs


Mike Pandey Documentary filmmaker on wildlife and environment
A most destructive and cruel trade continues to thrive along almost all the coastal cities of the world. As a consequence, the oceans’ resources are depleting at an alarmingly rate.Travellers visiting coastal towns and coastlines usually pick up exotic conch shells as souvenirs from their holidays. They remain oblivious of the fact that most of such marine products are now protected and illegal to possess.

In India, very few people realise that seashells and corals are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act. Trading in marine products can draw fines and even imprisonment. But while the law is clear, its implementation is haphazard. Seashells continue to be sold openly at coastal towns across the country. Chennai, Goa, Somnath and Kanyakumari... in fact, most coastal cities sell large conch shells, seashell-decorated items and trinkets. Curtains, made up of thousands of shells, are among the most popularly sold items.

To meet the demand, thousands of tonnes of live seashells and corals are dredged from the ocean floor by fishermen and traders every day. These live shells are boiled or dipped in acid in order to remove the marine creature. It is then polished well and sold. 

Corals, too, are broken up from live reefs to provide for saltwater home aquariums. Not many know that coral reefs take hundreds of years to form, and that there is no way to harvest them without damaging an entire micro ecosystem. Corals grow very slowly, and harvesting them causes permanent damage to the reefs. 

Corals are also nurseries for thousands of species of fish and marine life. Over-harvesting has already pushed many species, such as the queen conch, to the brink of extinction. Almost 80 per cent of the marine fish are endangered—the Cod and the Tuna almost on the edge, spiralling towards extinction. 
Most of us are ignorant of the ground realities as we browse the stores looking for a perfect souvenir to bring home from our holiday. The only way to stop the cruel harvesting of seashells is to stop buying them. Once the demand drops, the economics of the marketplace will take over, and this destructive trade would come to an end.

Although legislation is in place, awareness programmes by the authorities concerned need to reach the common people and holiday-makers so that they can take educated decisions.
Often, shop owners claim that they only sell empty or dead shells, but this is quite unlikely. Those who trade in shells, tend to collect live ones because the colours in those are more vibrant. Empty and dead shells fade and lose their lustre. 

Please be cautious and think before purchasing any marine trinket or souvenir. Your purchase will encourage people in the trade to keep on collecting live shells in large, unsustainable numbers.  
This is not to say that you can’t ever bring home a seashell as a souvenir. Walking on a beach, eyes peeled to the ground, looking for a perfect shell is one of the many joys of a seaside holiday and troll. It’s perfectly okay to bring home a meaningful souvenir that you find washed up on the shore. However, just ensure that the one you pick up is not a living shell.

 If unsure, put it in a mug of seawater and let it lie undisturbed. In case there’s a creature inside, it will pop its head out as it starts feeling safe. If that’s the case, please toss the shell back into the sea. 
Some beaches have rules about not taking back any seashells, or specific kinds, and corals. The rules exist, but are rarely enforced, such as in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands where only a tiny, easy-to-miss board at the airport in Port Blair advises its visitors not to take back seashells and corals. You may have to make a special effort to find out what the rules are for the beach you are visiting. The good effort will definitely help preserve our marine life. 

Also, keep in mind, that corals and shells that remain on the beach, play a vital role in the ecology. They help keep the sand in place, and turn into sand themselves as wind and water weather them. Lastly, do try to limit your marine haul. Maybe, you do not need 20 shells to remember your holiday... one beautiful shell might work just as well!

Emerald Marine Products moves offices, shifts branding
July 19, 2017
By Emerald Marine Products 



In response to an expansion of its line of man overboard alert systems, Emerald Marine Products has moved its offices. Its new address is 811 Alder St., Edmonds, WA 98020; the company's phone number remains 800-426-4201.
For 15 years, its product line centered on its ALERT2 transmitter, receiver and related equipment. With the recent introduction of the ALERT418 Transmitter and the ALERT418 Receiver launching this fall, corporate branding is shifting away from the ALERT name and toward the company name, Emerald Marine Products. An example is www.alert2.com redirecting to www.emeraldmarineproducts.com.
Emerald Marine Products manufactures life-saving products for the maritime industry, including water-activated man overboard transmitters and receivers. When immersed, the system instantly sounds a piercing alarm and can be wired to set a waypoint, activate external speakers and strobes, and/or stop engines. Unlike AIS-reliant devices, there is no lag time.
For more information, visit www.emeraldmarineproducts.com.

Forward-Looking Statement:


Certain statements and information included in this website constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Annual Report and press releases contain statements that constitute �forward-looking statements� under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all statements that look forward in time or express management�s beliefs, expectations or hopes. In particular, such statements include, without limitation, the Company�s belief that its financial strength will continue to support future product development efforts; the Company�s receptiveness to considering acquisition candidates which manufacture complementary products; the Company�s belief that the boating consumer continues to demand more choices and that the Company is meeting that demand; the Company�s belief that it has a strong portfolio of product offerings in a steadily improving recreational boating market; and the Company�s belief that its competitive advantages provide it benefits and the Company�s outlook for another strong year.  The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those identified under the title �Risk Factors� in the Company�s Annual Report on Form 10-K included as part of the Annual Report. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional discussion of factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations is contained in Marine Products' Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ending December 31, 2014.

Forward-Looking Statement:
Certain statements and information included in this press release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include statements that look forward in time or express management�s beliefs, expectations or hopes. In particular, such statements include, without limitation, statements related to our belief that prolonged winter weather during the first quarter has caused dealer inventories to be higher than normal and our concerns about continued cold weather in many of our domestic markets. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Marine Products Corporation to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. These risks include possible decreases in the level of consumer confidence and available funds impacting discretionary spending, increased interest rates and fuel prices, weather conditions, changes in consumer preferences, deterioration in the quality of Marine Products� network of independent boat dealers or availability of financing of their inventory, and competition from other boat manufacturers and dealers. Additional discussion of factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations is contained in Marine Products' Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ending December 31, 2013.

Forward-Looking Statement:


Certain statements and information included in this website constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Annual Report and press releases contain statements that constitute �forward-looking statements� under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all statements that look forward in time or express management�s beliefs, expectations or hopes. In particular, such statements include, without limitation, the Company�s belief that its financial strength will continue to support future product development efforts; the Company�s receptiveness to considering acquisition candidates which manufacture complementary products; the Company�s belief that the boating consumer continues to demand more choices and that the Company is meeting that demand; the Company�s belief that it has a strong portfolio of product offerings in a steadily improving recreational boating market; and the Company�s belief that its competitive advantages provide it benefits and the Company�s outlook for another strong year.  The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those identified under the title �Risk Factors� in the Company�s Annual Report on Form 10-K included as part of the Annual Report. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional discussion of factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations is contained in Marine Products' Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ending December 31, 2014.

Forward-Looking Statement:
Certain statements and information included in this press release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include statements that look forward in time or express management�s beliefs, expectations or hopes. In particular, such statements include, without limitation, statements related to our belief that prolonged winter weather during the first quarter has caused dealer inventories to be higher than normal and our concerns about continued cold weather in many of our domestic markets. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Marine Products Corporation to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. These risks include possible decreases in the level of consumer confidence and available funds impacting discretionary spending, increased interest rates and fuel prices, weather conditions, changes in consumer preferences, deterioration in the quality of Marine Products� network of independent boat dealers or availability of financing of their inventory, and competition from other boat manufacturers and dealers. Additional discussion of factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations is contained in Marine Products' Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ending December 31, 2013.

Marine Products Corporation Announces Date For Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results And Conference Call











Marine Products Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2017 Share Repurchases













YieldBoost Marine Products Corp From 2% To 15.8% Using Options
Shareholders of Marine Products Corp looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2% annualized dividend yield can sell the September covered call at the $15 strike and collect the premium based on the 50 cents bid, which annualizes to an additional 13.8% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 15.8% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $15 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MPX shares would have to advance 6.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 10% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.
