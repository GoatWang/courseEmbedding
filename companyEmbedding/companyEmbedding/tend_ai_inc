Product Description

 

TENDAI -The Daily Practice Manual

 

Use what the monks use to practice with! The Tendai Daily Practice Manual comes with both the original Japanese text and a complete English translation. 
This manual is normally only given to those receiving ordination. It includes preliminary practices, the Heart Sutra, The Sutra of Amitabha, and the vows of Dengyo Daishi. And now you can study it without shaving your head first or making a complete life commitment!
This 53 page Tendai Daily Practice Manual includes a cd with the proper pronunciations of all the chants. You can pop it in a player and chant along!!

Brought to you by SATI "Jisho" Richard W. Sears, an ordained teacher of Tendai Buddhism
