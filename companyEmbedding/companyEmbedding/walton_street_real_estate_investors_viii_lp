Private Equity Firm Walton Street Capital | Investment Strategies



























 







































Investment Approach
Investment Strategy












Our Philosophy
Our Strategy
Our Portfolio





STRATEGY: Single Asset Transactions
Walton Street utilizes the Principals’ substantial real estate experience, expertise and long-term relationships in sourcing and selectively acquiring single asset investments, with an emphasis on well located assets with institutional quality potential. Walton Street will focus on three primary strategies within single asset transactions:

Value Creation: Walton Street seeks real estate assets which have significant cash flow and residual value enhancement potential through creative and aggressive asset management, including targeted capital improvements, tenant lease-up opportunities and operating efficiencies.
Value Investing: Walton Street targets the acquisition of real estate assets at a discount to their replacement cost, or in some cases, below their current market value.
Larger Transactions: The emphasis on overseas markets from most of the major real estate opportunity investors and the capital constraints upon REITs and highly leveraged investors have created a capital void for larger transactions in the U.S., particularly for assets with significant scheduled tenant rollover and/or capital improvement requirements. Thus, larger U.S. transactions ($100 million and up) may be more likely to provide attractive pricing today for credible buyers with identified and discretionary sources of capital.

STRATEGY: Complex Ownership Situations
Walton Street seeks opportunities to acquire real estate assets which are under-valued due to the complexity or illiquidity of the existing ownership or capital structure. In such situations, Walton Street will seek to actively work through the complexities, gain control of the asset and prepare such asset for sale, without the prospective risks of bankruptcy, fragmented ownership or property-level issues.
STRATEGY: Illiquid Assets
Managers such as Walton Street who possess real estate investment and management expertise, in combination with financial and corporate skills, can capitalize upon unwilling owners in illiquid structures. Walton Street will seek: (i) passive opportunities in which the interests of an entity can be acquired at a significant discount to the underlying net asset value with the knowledge that the underlying assets are nearing their disposition; and (ii) owners of assets or holders of interests who seek to sell in an illiquid market.
STRATEGY: International Ventures
While our primary investment focus remains in the U.S., Walton Street has a demonstrated access to opportunities within global markets. Unlike our typical domestic investment strategy, Walton Street seeks to access these global opportunities through experienced, local partners and operators who have established, long-term relationships within their markets and have access to proprietary transaction flow.
STRATEGY: Targeted Development
Walton Street participates in selected land acquisition and development opportunities to capitalize on an imbalance between the supply and demand of space for a particular property type in specific markets which possess proven barriers to entry.
STRATEGY: Entity Recapitalizations
Walton Street seeks to capitalize on pricing arbitrage opportunities within and between the public and private markets. Walton Street will seek to make investments in entities which require additional capital to restructure their ownership, recapitalize their portfolios, fund additional acquisitions, or in some cases, capitalize upon the significant spread between the private net asset value of a public entity’s underlying real estate and the public entity’s share price.
STRATEGY: Private Equity Platform Investments
Walton Street will consider private equity investments in experienced real estate operators or operating companies which require capital to expand or create an enterprise with a significant asset base. Walton Street will seek to build enterprises that it cannot build efficiently on its own, in areas that possess public and/or private exit opportunities through: (i) the consolidation of a fragmented asset ownership base; and (ii) an enterprise’s leading expertise or specific industry profile.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
