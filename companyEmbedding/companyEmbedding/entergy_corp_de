History[edit]
Entergy traces its history to November 13, 1913, with the formation of Arkansas Power Company. Founder Harvey C. Couch used sawdust from a lumber company to bring electricity to rural Arkansas. In the 1920s, Couch set his sights on buying electric companies in other states. In 1923, he merged four independent companies in Mississippi into Mississippi Power and Light. Two years later, he formed Louisiana Power and Light to provide power to his Mississippi customers from northern Louisiana's natural gas fields.[1]
Meanwhile, in 1922, Sidney Mitchel of Electric Bond and Share Company (EBASCO), a subsidiary of General Electric, had merged several competing electric utilities in New Orleans into New Orleans Public Service, an EBASCO subsidiary. Mitchel began turning his attention to other territories, and eventually began competing with Couch. The two men ultimately decided to merge their resources. In 1925, Electric Power and Light Corporation, an EBASCO subsidiary headquartered in New Orleans, was formed with Couch as its president. It was the parent company for Mississippi Power and Light, Louisiana Power and Light, New Orleans Public Service, and Arkansas Power and Light.[1]
EBASCO was ordered dissolved in 1949 under the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act. Mississippi Power and Light, Louisiana Power and Light, New Orleans Public Service and Arkansas Power and Light were deemed to be an integrated system, and were reorganized under the control of a new holding company, Middle South Utilities.[1] It changed its name to Entergy in 1989, and merged/bought Gulf States Utilities, based in Beaumont, Texas, as of 12:00 midnight, January 1, 1994.
Since its inception, Entergy has been headquartered in New Orleans. That city had also been home to Entergy's various corporate predecessors since 1925. After Hurricane Katrina hit the city of New Orleans in August 2005, Entergy temporarily relocated the 1,500 employees and contractors who worked at the headquarters to other cities, including Clinton, Mississippi, Little Rock, Arkansas, and The Woodlands, Texas. In April 2006, the company began moving back into its New Orleans headquarters.[5]
Paul Hinnenkamp was named Chief Operating Officer and senior vice president in November 2015. He replaced Mark Savoff, who announced his retirement a few months earlier.[6]
Subsidiaries[edit]

Former Subsidiary Company Logos[edit]
Prior to the use of the current Entergy logo (Shown in the summary box at the upper right of this page), each subsidiary had its own distinctive logo. Upon the renaming of the company from Middle South Utilities System to Entergy, the present logo was adopted.
Louisiana Power and light Company, for example (today's Entergy Louisiana) used this logo (shown at right) extensively from about 1967 to 1989, on buildings equipment, and advertising:




LP&L Logo 1967-1989


Operations[edit]
Entergy's service territory includes the southeast corner of Louisiana and the cities of Lafayette and Baton Rouge, the eastern three-fourths of Arkansas and the western half of Mississippi. It also includes part of southeastern Texas, including the Beaumont-Port Arthur-Orange and Conroe-Woodlands-Kingwood areas.
A member of the Fortune 500, Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, and it is the second-largest nuclear generator in the United States after Exelon Corporation.[verification needed] It had annual revenues of more than $11 billion in 2010 and approximately 15,000 employees.[verification needed]
Entergy's main operating segments consist of the U.S. utility segment and the non-utility nuclear segment. The U.S. utility segment provides retail electricity services to approximately 2.7 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The non-utility nuclear segment operates a total of nine nuclear power plants:

New York – Indian Point Energy Center (scheduled for closing April 2020 and April 2021)[7]
Massachusetts – Pilgrim (scheduled for closing in 2019)
Vermont – Vermont Yankee (scheduled for decommission beginning in 2015)[8]
Michigan – Palisades Nuclear Station (scheduled for closing in Fall 2018)[9]
Arkansas – Arkansas Nuclear One
Louisiana – River Bend and Waterford
Mississippi – Grand Gulf
Nebraska – support services for the Cooper Nuclear Station through 2014, extended until January 2029

The company's nuclear division is headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi.
Entergy operates more than 41 plants using natural gas, nuclear, coal, oil and hydroelectric power with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity to serve its 2.7 million customers in the Gulf South.[10] Its extensive transmission system carries approximately 23,000 megawatts of power across more than 15,500 miles (24,900 km) of interconnected lines within a 112,000-square-mile (290,000 km2) area.[11]
Entergy is the only U.S. utility to make the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) nine years in a row. The DJSI is a listing of the companies whose overall environmental, social and economic sustainability performance scores were in the top 10 percent for their sector.[12][dead link][13] Entergy was named in 2008 to Forbes list of America's Most Trustworthy Companies, a ranking based on corporate governance practices and accounting transparency.[14]
On February 24, 2010, the Vermont Senate voted to prevent the Vermont Public Service Board from issuing the necessary certificate that would allow for the Vermont Yankee plant [15] to have its license renewed for another 20 years. The vote will not affect current operation of the plant, and the issue could be revisited by the legislature in either a special session later in 2010 or in its next regular session in 2011.
Entergy-Texas[edit]
Entergy-Texas operates as a wholly owned subsidiary. This was done to prepare the Texas side for de-regulation under Texas law but later Entergy notified the Texas PUC it would not be splitting the Texas side off as a de-regulated operation (to do so would cost billions). So the Texas side has remained connected to the rest of the Entergy network, though it has its own CEO and until 2012, was based where the former Gulf States Utilities was, in Beaumont, Texas. Entergy-Texas has moved to the rapidly developing area of The Woodlands, which is now larger population wise than the Beaumont area.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

History[edit]
Entergy traces its history to November 13, 1913, with the formation of Arkansas Power Company. Founder Harvey C. Couch used sawdust from a lumber company to bring electricity to rural Arkansas. In the 1920s, Couch set his sights on buying electric companies in other states. In 1923, he merged four independent companies in Mississippi into Mississippi Power and Light. Two years later, he formed Louisiana Power and Light to provide power to his Mississippi customers from northern Louisiana's natural gas fields.[1]
Meanwhile, in 1922, Sidney Mitchel of Electric Bond and Share Company (EBASCO), a subsidiary of General Electric, had merged several competing electric utilities in New Orleans into New Orleans Public Service, an EBASCO subsidiary. Mitchel began turning his attention to other territories, and eventually began competing with Couch. The two men ultimately decided to merge their resources. In 1925, Electric Power and Light Corporation, an EBASCO subsidiary headquartered in New Orleans, was formed with Couch as its president. It was the parent company for Mississippi Power and Light, Louisiana Power and Light, New Orleans Public Service, and Arkansas Power and Light.[1]
EBASCO was ordered dissolved in 1949 under the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act. Mississippi Power and Light, Louisiana Power and Light, New Orleans Public Service and Arkansas Power and Light were deemed to be an integrated system, and were reorganized under the control of a new holding company, Middle South Utilities.[1] It changed its name to Entergy in 1989, and merged/bought Gulf States Utilities, based in Beaumont, Texas, as of 12:00 midnight, January 1, 1994.
Since its inception, Entergy has been headquartered in New Orleans. That city had also been home to Entergy's various corporate predecessors since 1925. After Hurricane Katrina hit the city of New Orleans in August 2005, Entergy temporarily relocated the 1,500 employees and contractors who worked at the headquarters to other cities, including Clinton, Mississippi, Little Rock, Arkansas, and The Woodlands, Texas. In April 2006, the company began moving back into its New Orleans headquarters.[5]
Paul Hinnenkamp was named Chief Operating Officer and senior vice president in November 2015. He replaced Mark Savoff, who announced his retirement a few months earlier.[6]
Subsidiaries[edit]

Entergy Arkansas (formerly Arkansas Power and Light Company (AP&L))
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana (formerly Gulf States Utilities (GSU))
Entergy Louisiana (formerly Louisiana Power and Light Company (LP&L))
Entergy New Orleans (formerly New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (NOPSI))
Entergy Nuclear
Entergy Mississippi (formerly Mississippi Power and Light Company (MP&L))
Entergy Texas (formerly Gulf States Utilities (GSU))

Former Subsidiary Company Logos[edit]
Prior to the use of the current Entergy logo (Shown in the summary box at the upper right of this page), each subsidiary had its own distinctive logo. Upon the renaming of the company from Middle South Utilities System to Entergy, the present logo was adopted.
Louisiana Power and light Company, for example (today's Entergy Louisiana) used this logo (shown at right) extensively from about 1967 to 1989, on buildings equipment, and advertising:




LP&L Logo 1967-1989


Operations[edit]
Entergy's service territory includes the southeast corner of Louisiana and the cities of Lafayette and Baton Rouge, the eastern three-fourths of Arkansas and the western half of Mississippi. It also includes part of southeastern Texas, including the Beaumont-Port Arthur-Orange and Conroe-Woodlands-Kingwood areas.
A member of the Fortune 500, Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, and it is the second-largest nuclear generator in the United States after Exelon Corporation.[verification needed] It had annual revenues of more than $11 billion in 2010 and approximately 15,000 employees.[verification needed]
Entergy's main operating segments consist of the U.S. utility segment and the non-utility nuclear segment. The U.S. utility segment provides retail electricity services to approximately 2.7 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The non-utility nuclear segment operates a total of nine nuclear power plants:

New York – Indian Point Energy Center (scheduled for closing April 2020 and April 2021)[7]
Massachusetts – Pilgrim (scheduled for closing in 2019)
Vermont – Vermont Yankee (scheduled for decommission beginning in 2015)[8]
Michigan – Palisades Nuclear Station (scheduled for closing in Fall 2018)[9]
Arkansas – Arkansas Nuclear One
Louisiana – River Bend and Waterford
Mississippi – Grand Gulf
Nebraska – support services for the Cooper Nuclear Station through 2014, extended until January 2029

The company's nuclear division is headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi.
Entergy operates more than 41 plants using natural gas, nuclear, coal, oil and hydroelectric power with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity to serve its 2.7 million customers in the Gulf South.[10] Its extensive transmission system carries approximately 23,000 megawatts of power across more than 15,500 miles (24,900 km) of interconnected lines within a 112,000-square-mile (290,000 km2) area.[11]
Entergy is the only U.S. utility to make the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) nine years in a row. The DJSI is a listing of the companies whose overall environmental, social and economic sustainability performance scores were in the top 10 percent for their sector.[12][dead link][13] Entergy was named in 2008 to Forbes list of America's Most Trustworthy Companies, a ranking based on corporate governance practices and accounting transparency.[14]
On February 24, 2010, the Vermont Senate voted to prevent the Vermont Public Service Board from issuing the necessary certificate that would allow for the Vermont Yankee plant [15] to have its license renewed for another 20 years. The vote will not affect current operation of the plant, and the issue could be revisited by the legislature in either a special session later in 2010 or in its next regular session in 2011.
Entergy-Texas[edit]
Entergy-Texas operates as a wholly owned subsidiary. This was done to prepare the Texas side for de-regulation under Texas law but later Entergy notified the Texas PUC it would not be splitting the Texas side off as a de-regulated operation (to do so would cost billions). So the Texas side has remained connected to the rest of the Entergy network, though it has its own CEO and until 2012, was based where the former Gulf States Utilities was, in Beaumont, Texas. Entergy-Texas has moved to the rapidly developing area of The Woodlands, which is now larger population wise than the Beaumont area.

Summer Time Lake Levels

Lake Hamilton: 398.9’ – 399.9’
Lake Catherine: 303’ – 305’

Click here for the Latest Issue of
Life on the Lakes newsletter




Spring 2017 Refill Dates Announced

The annual refill of both Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine will begin on March 3 and be completed by March 13 this year. Lake levels will be raised about six inches per day. Both lakes are drawn down each year typically either three feet or five feet on an alternating basis as a natural method to help control the growth of vegetation. The 2016/2017 drawdown was five feet, according this schedule, we anticipate the 2017/2018 drawdown to be for three feet but the actual drawdown depth will be determined in August after a field inspection of the lake by the Arkansas Game & Fish Commission and Entergy.
The annual drawdown will take place between the dates of Nov. 1 and Nov. 10 each fall.

Lakes Hamilton and Catherine are a part of Project 271, a hydroelectric project licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Entergy operates these lakes and associated lands subject to the license issued and administered by FERC. FERC's license requires Entergy to manage use and occupancy of project lands and waters for public use and recreation.
This page was prepared by Entergy to provide the public with much-needed information about the project, its management, and what rights and responsibilities the public has to use of the project lands and water.
Entergy maintains and operates, but does not own the Toledo Bend Reservoir, on the Sabine River where it borders Texas and Louisiana. Toledo Bend, near the towns of Burkeville, Texas, and Many, La., is capable of generating 80 megawatts of power.

Supply Chain



Entergy has a strong history of commitment to the communities we serve. Entergy is committed to helping suppliers define innovative and competitive ways of doing business by providing solutions to support Entergy’s business strategies. We welcome suppliers who can help us meet our daily demands, support our rigorous emergency response efforts and provide quality products and services to meet the overall organizational needs.





Entergy's Safety Culture

A core value at Entergy is working safely. To achieve this value, Entergy creates opportunities to increase employee and supplier safety awareness and involvement. This requires employee and supplier ownership of the safety process to reduce the risk of injury to themselves and the customers we serve.
Entergy will go beyond simple compliance of safety regulations and seek opportunities to improve working environments. Entergy will continuously improve safety programs by identifying all safety hazards and developing plans to eliminate or mitigate the hazard so that we can reduce OSHA recordable, lost time and restricted duty injuries and maintain our world class safety performance.
Our work is never so urgent that we cannot take the time to do it safely.

Supplier Diversity

Entergy works to identify, prequalify and promote the utilization of diverse suppliers (i.e., minority, women, veterans, disabled veterans, HUB Zone) capable of meeting Entergy’s various procurement needs. Read More…
