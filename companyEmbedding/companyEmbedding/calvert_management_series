A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.

 About Us

Calvert is a recognized leader in Responsible Investing. Our mission is to deliver superior long-term performance to our clients and to enable them to achieve positive impact.
Calvert Research and Management traces its roots to Calvert Investments, which was founded in 1976 and was the first to launch a socially responsible mutual fund that avoided investment in companies that did business in apartheid-era South Africa. Today, the Calvert Funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed strategies, U.S. and international equity strategies, fixed-income strategies, and asset allocation funds — all managed in accordance with the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment.
Through the years, the Calvert Funds have stayed at the forefront of Responsible Investing, applying innovative investment strategies, groundbreaking research, shareholder advocacy programs and public policy initiatives. Today, we’re helping a new generation of investors see financial potential through the lens of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Total return prior to the commencement of the class reflects returns of another Fund class. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect applicable sales charge (but  were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower. The share class has no sales charge.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding.


About Risk: 
Investment in mutual funds involves risk, including possible loss of principal invested. You could lose money on your investment in the Fund or the Fund could underperform because of the following risks: the market prices of bonds held by the Fund may fa ll; individual investments of the Fund may not perform as expected; and/or the Fund's portfolio management practices may not achieve the desired result. Bond funds are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. When interest rates rise, the value of  fixed-income securities will generally fall. In addition, the credit quality of the securities may deteriorate, which could lead to default or bankruptcy of the issuer where the issuer becomes unable to pay its obligations when due. Because a significant  portion of securities held by the Fund may have variable or floating interest rates, the amount of the Fund's monthly distributions to shareholders are expected to vary. Generally when market interest rates fall, the amount of the distributions will dec rease. Investments in high-yield, high risk bonds can involve a substantial risk of loss. An active trading style can result in higher turnover (exceeding 100%), may translate to higher transaction costs, may increase your tax liability, and may affect F und performance. Investing primarily in responsible investments carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the Fund may underperform funds that do not utilize a responsible investment strategy. In evaluating a company, the Advisor is depende nt upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the Advisor to incorrectly assess a company’s ESG performance.



1. Bloomberg Barclays 9-12 Months Short Treasury Index measures the performance of U.S Treasury bills, notes, and bonds with a maturity between nine and twelve months. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales  charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as applicable. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.
2. Source: Fund prospectus.
3. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 1/31/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.

While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

About Risk: 
Investment in mutual funds involves risk, including possible loss of principal invested. You could lose money on your investment in the Fund or the Fund could underperform because of the following risks: the market prices of bonds held by the Fund may fa ll; individual investments of the Fund may not perform as expected; and/or the Fund's portfolio management practices may not achieve the desired result. Bond funds are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. When interest rates rise, the value of  fixed-income securities will generally fall. In addition, the credit quality of the securities may deteriorate, which could lead to default or bankruptcy of the issuer where the issuer becomes unable to pay its obligations when due. Because a significant  portion of securities held by the Fund may have variable or floating interest rates, the amount of the Fund's monthly distributions to shareholders are expected to vary. Generally when market interest rates fall, the amount of the distributions will dec rease. Investments in high-yield, high risk bonds can involve a substantial risk of loss. An active trading style can result in higher turnover (exceeding 100%), may translate to higher transaction costs, may increase your tax liability, and may affect F und performance. Investing primarily in responsible investments carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the Fund may underperform funds that do not utilize a responsible investment strategy. In evaluating a company, the Advisor is depende nt upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the Advisor to incorrectly assess a company’s ESG performance.



1. Bloomberg Barclays 9-12 Months Short Treasury Index measures the performance of U.S Treasury bills, notes, and bonds with a maturity between nine and twelve months. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales  charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as applicable. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.
2. Source: Fund prospectus.
3. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 1/31/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.
6. The Morningstar Ultrashort Bond Category includes funds that invest primarily in investment-grade U.S. fixed income and have durations typically less than one year.
7. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Subsidized yield reflects the effect of fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may  be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capital.
8. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

**Req ID:** 66702 **Location Type: Store** **Retail Cashier** Working at Love′s is a very different kind of job. We want you to succeed, not just do the work. Whether you want a part time job to pay bills, or are interested in learning the business to build a career, we have your back. That′s how we do it. **Cashiers Rock! Yes, rock!** Retail Cashiers are in a unique position. You interact with every customer. Sometimes it′s a few seconds, others it′s longer. But each time it′s a chance to leave a positive impression. Customers come back because of you! When you rock, we all rock.

Winning a customer over by being thoughtful and friendly means the world. We look for great people who care. **To get started, we have to ask a few questions.** _If you′re good with our requirements, we′d really like to hear from you._ + Can you work flexible shifts—including nights, weekends, and sometimes holidays? + Are you reliable and present yourself well? + Would standing behind the checkout counter and doing some light lifting (no more than 50 lbs) and bending once in a while for an 8 hour shift be a problem? + Can you operate deli equipment and make sure we′re always following food policies? + Are you ok with some light paperwork and basic math? + Do you like meeting new people and work well with others? + Can you be trusted to always be thinking safety first? **Join us on the Road to Success.** We want everyone who joins the Love′s family to succeed and we mean that! Our Road to Success Program was created for you. We provide leadership and management skills training and full apprenticeships for those just starting out.

Investing Strategies




 Climate Change




 Impact Investing








By Cary Krosinsky



    	Updated August 11, 2016 
		




Founded in 1976 and now headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Calvert Investments had more than $13 billion in assets under management as of July 31, 2014, making it one of the largest sustainable and responsible (SRI) fund managers in the US today. Calvert serves individual investors, financial advisors and their clients, retirement plans and insurance carriers, as well as institutional investors, through a variety of equity, bond, and asset-allocation strategies, using environmental, social, and governance (ESG) research and corporate engagement.









 Strategies are available via mutual funds, sub-advisory services, and separate account management.Calvert is one of the longest standing players in SRI since its inception more than 30 years ago.Shortly after the launch of its first mutual fund, Calvert Investments made headlines for being the first mutual fund advisor to take a stand against Apartheid. Four years later, Calvert Investments became the first mutual fund advisor to file a shareholder resolution tied to a social issue (on labor/management relations - they have been involved in many such resolutions since as can be seen at their website here).Legacy of FirstsCalvert has long maintained a strong conviction that evaluating the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) profiles of companies – in addition to traditional financial metrics – gives Calvert broader and deeper insight, helping the company best generate attractive returns and avoid risks.



In the 1990s, Calvert Investments won a landmark victory for the SRI community. Calvert asked the Department of Labor (DOL) for an advisory opinion on the suitability of socially screened funds as investment options for defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. Until then, managers of such plans had been concerned that including SRI funds in their offerings would violate their legal obligation to maximize returns, based on a mistaken belief that SRI funds yielded inferior returns.









 The DOL advised that an SRI fund in fact can be used as an investment option in 401(k) plans, provided its expected return is equal to other investments with similar risk. This expanded access to SRI funds for individual investors.In 2004, Calvert launched the first global code of corporate conduct – the Calvert Women’s Principles® – to focus exclusively on empowering, advancing, and investing in women worldwide. The UN subsequently adopted these Principles. In 2014, Calvert marks the tenth anniversary of the Principles and celebrates the fact that more than 700 global companies have signed on. From Pioneer to Established InstitutionCalvert has been on the frontlines of taking the SRI movement from being something of a radical idea to what is now more of an established force. Now, Calvert is in transition, seeking to redefine itself as a recognized, leading competitor in a somewhat developed SRI market.Calvert embraces the fact that sustainable investing is a big tent. It is no longer a one-size-fits-all strategy, nor has it been for some time, which is why Calvert offers multiple approaches across  equity and fixed-income. The company distinguishes itself from much of its competition by meeting a wide range of investor needs, and continues to expand its offerings.









 Calvert is actively building its retirement specialist team, and is enhancing its offerings for institutional investors by recruiting more specialists and broadening its product base across asset classes.Under the big-tent, Calvert’s investment strategies, both equity and fixed income, can be categorized by one of the following three sustainable investment approaches:Applying sustainable and responsible criteria to help clients invest in ways consistent with their values Creating portfolios that focus on  investment themes with positive impactOr by using the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance data in the security analysis process to drive better investment outcomesIn all cases, Calvert excludes companies from its portfolios that are involved in certain particularly harmful activities, such as tobacco and weapons production.

 Thereafter, Calvert actively seeks out companies that effectively manage their impacts.Human rights protection in the supply chain, reporting on environmental practices, transparency and accountability at the Board level – these are the hallmarks of the best run companies. When properly analyzed according to this model, Calvert believes that these considerations can contribute to better outcomes for investors.Calvert’s approach to sustainable investing is evident in some of its developments in recent years:At a time when water issues are among the top global environmental risks, the firm serves as investment advisor to the Calvert Global Water Fund, which invests in companies whose main business is in the water sector, or that are significantly involved in water-related services or technologies. Calvert is also pioneering in the fixed-income space where it recently developed a “green” fixed income strategy and now manages the Calvert Green Bond Fund. The fund is one of the first products to use an approach that looks for corporate leaders in addition to investing in “green” project bonds. The firm also recently launched a resource efficiency strategy focused on seeking out the companies in each sector that are making the most efficient use of resources in their areas of business, such as water, energy, and waste. The strategy, which is the result of Calvert’s alliance with Osmosis Investment Management, emerged in response to the recent trend of global capital allocation to new products, processes, technologies, and services designed to confront global economic challenges, such as over-population and natural resource depletion. It is currently available through Merrill Lynch.Making an Impact on Corporate BehaviorCalvert also has stood out in its use of strategic engagement and shareholder advocacy to encourage positive change in companies in virtually every industry, both to establish certain commitments and to encourage concrete progress. Calvert has been particularly successful in promoting better human- and labor-rights practices in corporate supply chains, and in promoting diversity on corporate boards of directors. Indeed, Calvert has filed more than 60 shareholder resolutions with companies, and successfully encouraged the addition of 31 female and/or minority candidates to boards. To date, Calvert has filed more resolutions on board diversity than any other investment manager.A Final Word…Today, Calvert is an organization in transition.The company announced that its CEO, Barbara Krumsiek, would be stepping down at the end of 2014. Krumsiek, who led Calvert for 17 years and tripled the company’s assets under management during her tenure, will remain chairwoman of the board of directors. Under the management of recent CEO John Streur, there have been significant layoffs, and the firm last had $12 Billion of assets, meaning it is no longer the leader in the US, having been surpassed in assets by Parnassus and TIAA-CREF among others. The Calvert brand remains seminal but can it nimbly evolve is a key unanswered question before the firm as others move forward with newer strategies.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
