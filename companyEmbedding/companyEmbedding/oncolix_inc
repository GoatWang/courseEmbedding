 ONCOLIX, INC. Announces Capital Raise of $4.2 Million 
         










    










 






 











 









ONCOLIX, INC. Announces Capital Raise of $4.2 Million

Jan 27, 2015, 09:05 ET
		  		  					
						 from   ONCOLIX, INC. 











 
















































 

 




















 


HOUSTON, Jan. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ONCOLIX, INC., announced today that it has completed a Series A round of financing, led by PoC Capital, LLC and Integrium Clinical Research, LLC.  Also participating in the finance round was the Texas Emerging Technology Fund and certain healthcare-focused investors, representing gross proceeds to ONCOLIX of approximately $4.2 million. ONCOLIX plans to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund activities relating to its drug candidate, ProlantaTM, for a Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial for the treatment of ovarian cancer.  
About ONCOLIX
ONCOLIX is a privately-held, clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of ProlantaTM to treat cancer.  The FDA has cleared the Company's Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for a Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of ovarian cancer. This trial is expected to commence in 2015. 
About ProlantaTM
ProlantaTM is a therapeutic protein with a novel mechanism of action called autophagy, or autophagocytosis.  ProlantaTM targets human prolactin, which is implicated in proliferation of cancer cells, and has the potential to treat ovarian, breast, prostate and other solid tumor cancers. Prolanta's mechanism of action was described in a publication (Cell Reports) in April, 2014, written by scientists at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. "Prolactin is a potent growth factor for many types of cancers, including ovarian cancer," said senior author Anil Sood, M.D., professor of Gynecologic Oncology.  "When we block prolactin signaling, it sets off a chain of downstream events that result in cell death by autophagy."

(Oncolix) is a clinical-stage biotechnology companyWe are developing Prolanta™,a targeted therapeutic protein for the treatment of ovarian, breast and other cancers. The Company has a US FDA-cleared IND to commence human testing of Prolanta™ in our first indication, the treatment of ovarian cancer.  This clinical trial began in 2016. Prolanta™ is a prolactin receptor antagonist that has demonstrated significant efficacy in xenograft models through a unique mechanism of action, autophagy (see Our Science). In addition to ovarian cancer, there is strong preclinical evidence Prolanta™ will be effective in breast, prostate and other cancers. The FDA has also approved the designation of Prolanta™ as an Orphan Drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer, which may allow an accelerated regulatory approval by the FDA, reduced filing fees, federal tax credits and marketing exclusivity.​          About us        HomeAboutKey RelationshipsManagement Team Board Members Advisors Our Science HUMAN PROLACTIN AND CANCER Human Prolactin and Chemo Prolanta Structure Ovarian Cancer and Prolanta Breast Cancer and Prolanta Other Cancers Our Patents Publications News and Events Careers Contact    Type your paragraph here.
