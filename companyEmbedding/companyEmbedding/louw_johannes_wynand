Biography of Wynand Johannes Louw




						Currently a student at the University of Pretoria, MSc Chemistry. I started writing, well... I don't exactly recall when, but I think I wrote my first poem when I was 13 or so. Apart from poems, I also write short stories and I am busy working on a novel: No fear.
					
 
 

Wynand Johannes Louw Poems


Ballade Of Warrior Fallen

                            With fields of green and clouds
overhead, the roses of life have died.
With gears turning the acts of war|
and souls to pay the price,
                        

My Final Heaven

                            Is this the curse I am left with
once I have finally found
my destiny and company of valour? 
Is this the fate that we have to share,
                        

Paradox

                            death is a ghastly beauty - 
giving the hope of change, 
taking the hope of dreams.
                        

Goodbye

                            Thoughts race as I brace myself
to get onto the chair again.
I test the rope, 
fastened tightly to the roof.
                        

Traveling Refugees

                            The soles of their shoes
are worn down
by the seeming endless
pilgrimage. Blister upon
                        

Broken Children

                            He cried out for something, 
he cried out for truth.
Trying to hold on
in a world that's broken.
                        

If I

                            If I could tell you
how much I need you right now, 
would you come right over? 
If I could tell you
                        

Secrets

                            Secretly he breaks down tonight, 
secretly he bleeds out tonight.
Pulling at the daggers he stabbed in his heart -
twisting them, increasing the pain.
                        

Would You?

                            Would you still love me
if you knew who I am? 
Would you still love me
if you knew what I've done?
                        

Within Them

                            As the blood forms
the rivers that flow
past the blade that made them -
	the eyes see their last,
                        

One Question To Life

                            Let me ask you a question, 
fundamental in its simplicity.
A question around which
worlds can be built or burnt.
                        

Light Never Gone

                            Where are you now? 
After all you’ve done
and all we still needed to do, 
you are Gone now,
                        

06 August 1945

                            the light that shone
from far beyond, 
the darkness it precedes.
the flood of wind,
                        

Vita Pro Meus Leo-Amo Angelus

                            Fear not the world, my Leonine…
Fear not the silent times between.
Fear not the chance of loneliness, 
fear not that love could whither yon.
