Fitch Affirms Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-LC12 Certificates | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-LC12 
      Certificates
    





April 27, 2016 04:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust 2013-LC12 certificates due to stable performance since issuance. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. As of the April distribution, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been paid down by 2.59% to $1.37 billion from 
      $1.41 billion at issuance. Based on the annualized and full year 2015 
      reported net operating income (NOI) of the 98.8% of the pool that 
      reported, the pool's overall NOI has improved 10.1% since issuance and 
      5.3% higher than 2014 reported NOI.
    

      There are currently no delinquent or specially serviced loans and eight 
      loans on the servicer watchlist (10.2%). No loans are currently 
      defeased. Four of the properties on the watchlist are encountering 
      occupancy issues that were anticipated at issuance and represent minimal 
      asset risk. The remaining four properties are on the servicer watchlist 
      for deferred maintenance issues that are expected to be addressed by the 
      respective sponsors.
    

      Concentrations in the pool include 14.4% full-term interest-only loans 
      and 48.2% partial-term interest-only. The transaction is primarily 
      composed of four real estate sectors encompassing retail (40.2%), office 
      (21.6%), manufactured housing (13.2%), and lodging (11.7%). The 
      transaction's retail concentration includes five retail loans in the top 
      15 (26.6%), four of which are regional malls (24.6%). Furthermore, 
      significant sponsor concentration exists with General Growth Properties 
      and RHP Properties Inc. comprising 30.4% of the pool.
    

      The largest loan in the pool (7.3%) is secured by a portfolio of 13 
      suburban office properties, Innsbrook Office Portfolio, located in the 
      Richmond, VA MSA, 20 miles northwest of the central business district. 
      The portfolio's rent roll is diversified with 96 unique tenants. Two 
      tenants, The Hanover Insurance Company and Wells Fargo which occupy 2.1% 
      and 4.5% of the total NRA respectively, recently exited their leasable 
      space during the first quarter of 2016. Two more tenants, Capital One 
      and AT&T which occupy 13.6% and 3.2% of the total NRA respectively, are 
      scheduled to vacate their premises during the second half of 2016. The 
      resulting expected portfolio occupancy is approximately 81%. The 
      possible tenant exits were contemplated at issuance and a leasing 
      reserve of $1.5 million, as well as ongoing leasing reserves, were 
      established to mitigate portfolio risk and fund leasing costs to 
      backfill the space. Fitch's analysis was based on a stressed full year 
      2015 NOI adjusted to reflect the tenant exits, as well as a stressed cap 
      rate.
    

      The second largest loan, Carolina Place (6.6%), is a 1.2 million square 
      foot regional mall located 10 miles southwest of the Charlotte CBD. The 
      loan is sponsored by a joint venture between General Growth Properties 
      and the New York State Common Retirement Fund. The mall has undergone 
      two rounds of redevelopment in less than 10 years and is the dominant 
      property in the South Charlotte/North Rock Hill trade area. A newly 
      constructed property by Simon Properties and Taubman, Carolina Premium 
      Outlets, opened at the end of the July 2014. This property is located 10 
      miles from the subject on a site that is in close proximity to 
      Interstate 485 and 77. The opening of the center appears to have had 
      limited negative impact on Carolina Place's 2015 tenant sales. A second 
      phase of development is projected to begin shortly that will add an 
      additional 50,000 sf of retail space. Simon properties dominant retail 
      center in the Charlotte market, South Park Mall, is currently expanding 
      its footprint and is expected to open a new H&M anchor in 2016. Fitch 
      will monitor the renewal activity at the property along with any further 
      negative impacts from the opening of the Premium Outlet and South Park 
      redevelopment.
    

      Fitch is monitoring the performance of the sixth largest loan, Rimrock 
      Mall (5.6%), which is a 702,317-sf regional mall, located in Billings, 
      MT. The loan is sponsored by Starwood Capital Group. The property is 
      anchored by JC Penney, Dillard's, and Dillard's Men & Children. As of 
      December 2015, the servicer reported total mall occupancy fell to 79% 
      from full occupancy at year end 2013. Several in-line tenants, including 
      Wet Seal, Abercrombie and Fitch, Deb Shop, Aeropostle, and Gap vacated 
      in 2015. The sponsor is looking to backfill a significant portion of the 
      vacancy with H&M and Lane Bryant during the 2016 calendar year. Fitch's 
      analysis was based on a stressed full year 2015 NOI which reflected the 
      decrease in occupancy and a stressed cap rate. Fitch will continue to 
      monitor the loan's performance as the Billings, MT region's economic 
      activity is related to the oil and gas industry.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch used a deterministic stress in its analysis of the pool. The 
      Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable as overall performance of 
      the transaction is as expected. Fitch will continue to monitor the 
      property type and sponsor concentrations as well as the performance of 
      the Fitch loans of concern. If pool performance deteriorates, negative 
      rating implications are possible.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
