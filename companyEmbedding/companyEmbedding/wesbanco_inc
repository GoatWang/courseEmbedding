Western Pennsylvania expansion[edit]
In late 2012 Wesbanco merged with the Pittsburgh-based Fidelity Bancorp Inc. Remaining Fidelity branches were converted into Wesbanco branches.[5] It further expanded its Pittsburgh-area presence with the purchase of Ellwood City-based ESB Financial Corporation in late 2014, converting those branches to WesBanco in April 2015.[4] The two deals placed WesBanco among the top ten banks in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area by deposits, after it had a handful of branches it opened organically in Washington, Pennsylvania.[4]
Kentucky and Southern Indiana expansion[edit]
On August 19, 2016, the shareholders of Your Community Bankshares approved the merger through adoption of the previously announced agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which Your Community Bankshares will merge with and into WesBanco[6] (slated for November 4, 2016). By merging with Your Community Bank, WesBanco expands its Banking Center footprint into the Kentucky and Southern Indiana areas.

Benefits to working at WesBanco.

Health Insurance
WesBanco’s Group Health plan includes medical and dental coverage effective the first of the month on or following date of hire.  Employees eligible to participate are all full-time employees and all part-time employees that work on average at least 17.5 hours per week.  

The medical plan includes prescriptions and vision benefits through a PPO or HMO. The High Deductible PPO plan is accompanied by a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA), which is an employer funded account that employees can use to help defray medical expenses.  

The dental plan covers preventive (cleanings and x-rays), basic (fillings, extractions), major (crowns, dentures) and dependent orthodontia services to age 19.  

Flexible Benefits Plan (Flex Plan)
The WesBanco, Inc. Flex Plan is designed to provide employees the opportunity to pay for qualified benefits with pre-tax rather than after-tax dollars, which increases take-home income.  All medical and dental premiums are payroll deducted on a pre-tax basis.

Health Care & Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts
Health Care and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts are also available under the Flex Plan.  Employees can set aside money on a pre-tax basis to cover unreimbursed medical/dental and/or dependent care expenses. Employees eligible to participate are all full-time employees and all part-time employees that work on average at least 17.5 hours per week.  Employees can begin participation on the first day of the month following date of hire pending receipt of applicable benefit enrollment information.

Vacation Days
Paid vacation days accrue on a quarterly basis, and employees are eligible to utilize vacation days after the successful completion of the initial employment period.  A maximum of four (4) weeks vacation is based on years of service.

Paid Absence Days
Employees are eligible for absence days after the successful completion of the initial employment period.  

Short Term Disability Days
Paid short term disability days at 100% of salary for full-time employees for employee illness after successful completion of the initial employment period. Benefits accrue based upon category and years of service.

Long-Term Disability
Premium fully paid by the bank for all full-time employees.  Coverage is effective 31 days after date of hire.

Holidays
Most Federal Reserve Bank holidays are observed.

Group Life Insurance & Accidental Death & Dismemberment
Premium fully paid by the bank for all full-time employees.  The amount of insurance is 3 times the employee’s annual salary, rounded to the next higher $1,000, up to a maximum of $500,000.

Optional Term Life Insurance (through Group Life Plan) 
Optional life insurance is available for full-time employees at the group rate.  Premium rates are based upon age and covered through payroll deduction.  Employees can purchase optional life insurance in increments of $10,000 up to $300,000. Employees can also purchase optional life insurance for spouses and dependents at the group rate. Life insurance for new employees is offered at a guarantee issue up to $100,000. Additional restrictions may apply.

Colonial Life Products (Voluntary) 
All full-time and part-time employees who work an average of at least 17.5 hours per week are eligible to participate at the first of the next quarter following date of hire. Products include:  Short-Term Disability; Cancer Insurance; Term and Universal Life Insurance, Critical Illness, and Accident Insurance.  Some policies sold on a pre-tax basis only. Additional restrictions may apply to certain products. 

Transportation Fringe Benefit Plan
The transportation plan is designed to provide employees the opportunity to pay for qualified transportation benefits with pre-tax rather than after-tax dollars through a reimbursement program. Qualified transportation benefits include parking, vanpooling and mass transit passes.

WesBanco, Inc. KSOP Plan
The KSOP has two parts: The Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 401(k) Plan.  Employees, at least 21 years of age, are automatically enrolled in the plan the first of the month on or after 60 days of employment. Employees, who are not 21, will be automatically enrolled on the first day of the month on or after 60 days following your 21st birthday.  

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) 
: Vehicle through which the Corporation may purchase shares of WesBanco, Inc. Common Stock for discretionary allocation to the employees.  Employees are vested in any ESOP allocation after the completion of five (5) years of vesting service.  
401(k) Plan
: The 401(k) Plan is a pre-tax vehicle for savings.  The employer-matching contribution is 100% on the first 3% of compensation deferred, and 50% on the next 2% of compensation deferred.  Therefore, an employee who defers 5% of compensation is matched in cash at 4% by WesBanco. Employees are immediately vested in the employer match. WesBanco automatically enrolls employees at 3% of compensation invested in the T. Rowe Price Retirement Fund (based upon appropriate age bracket). Participants may change their contribution rate and investments upon receipt of their plan information via the website or voice response line at any time.

Educational Benefits
All employees are eligible to take classes offered through AIB (American Institute of Banking).  AIB’s program allows employees to continue higher education while specializing in the banking field.  The tuition fee and the cost of books for approved courses will be paid for by the Bank if the employee satisfactorily completes the course.  All full-time employees are eligible to apply for reimbursement for coursework at an approved educational institution.  
In addition to the various health, insurance and retirement benefits you receive as a WesBanco employee, we also offer a host of other services and activities to show our employees that we appreciate their dedicated effort and commitment to WesBanco. It’s important to us that our employees know we consider them both individually, and as a part of the entire corporation, to be a valuable asset to WesBanco.

America Saves Designation










































WESBANCO BANK, INC. AGAIN RECEIVES THE AMERICA SAVES DESIGNATION OF SAVINGS EXCELLENCE



Wheeling, WV, June 5, 2017 -


WesBanco, Inc.’s (Nasdaq:WSBC) affiliate, WesBanco Bank was recognized today with the 2017 America Saves Designation of Savings Excellence for its extraordinary efforts during America Saves Week/Military Saves Week to encourage customers to save money. The award is presented annually to financial institutions that succeed in getting people to open and add to wealth-building accounts.
In addition to being an active participant in America Saves Week since its inception in 2007, WesBanco is proud of its more than 11-year partnership with America Saves to provide valuable financial resources to educate and encourage individuals about savings. Across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, WesBanco actively encourages savings year-round with special products designed to encourage wealth building.
“WesBanco is extremely pleased to be recognized by America Saves, for the second consecutive year, for the dedication to our communities demonstrated across our organization. This recognition would not have been possible without the devotion and hard work of our employees, as they once again went above and beyond business as usual during America Saves Week to encourage customers to save. For almost 150 years, WesBanco has maintained its strong community banking roots by focusing on the success of the communities in which we do business. In fact, our employees collectively dedicate thousands of hours per year to savings education, including participation in the Teach Children to Save and Get Smart About Credit initiatives, in addition to America Saves Week,” said Lynn Asensio, WesBanco’s Executive Vice President for Retail.
“This was our most competitive year so far, with institutions engaging in creative ways and offering savings incentives,” said Allie Vered, America Saves Director. “A lot of people don’t believe they can find the money to save. But saving is not an amount, it’s an activity. Convincing consumers to pay themselves first, to hang on to dollars instead of spending, and to take a pledge to achieve a goal go a long way towards helping them develop savings habits. We recognize WesBanco Bank for their efforts to educate and inspire.”
Just two in five American households report making good or excellent savings progress. America Saves Week is an annual opportunity for people to assess their savings status and make a plan to start or increase saving, and for organizations like banks or credit unions to support good savings behavior. America Saves Week is coordinated each year by America Saves and the American Savings Education Council. WesBanco Bank was one of 16 banks and 16 credit unions recognized nationally.

Flexible Benefits Plan (Flex Plan)
The WesBanco, Inc. Flex Plan is designed to provide employees the opportunity to pay for qualified benefits with pre-tax rather than after-tax dollars, which increases take-home income.  All medical and dental premiums are payroll deducted on a pre-tax basis.

Health Care and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts are also available under the Flex Plan.  Employees can set aside money on a pre-tax basis to cover unreimbursed medical/dental and/or dependent care expenses.

WesBanco, Inc. KSOP Plan
The KSOP has two parts: The Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 401(k) Plan.  Employees, at least 21 years of age, are automatically enrolled in the plan the first of the month on or after 60 days of employment. Employees, who are not 21, will be automatically enrolled on the first day of the month on or after 60 days following your 21st birthday.

401(k) Plan
: The 401(k) Plan is a pre-tax vehicle for savings.  The employer-matching contribution is 100% on the first 3% of compensation deferred, and 50% on the next 2% of compensation deferred.  Therefore, an employee who defers 5% of compensation is matched in cash at 4% by WesBanco. Employees are immediately vested in the employer match. WesBanco automatically enrolls employees at 3% of compensation invested in the T. Rowe Price Retirement Fund (based upon appropriate age bracket). Participants may change their contribution rate and investments upon receipt of their plan information via the website or voice response line at any time.

What is the history of WesBanco?

From the moment we took our very first deposit, right up to today, our story has been a story of our customers – and of the region. We’ve grown as you’ve grown. And our success has been built on your success.  Today our bank operates under the same basic charter that was issued on January 20, 1870 to “The German Bank” which officially began operations on April 3, 1870. Seventeen years later, on February 3, 1887, the Dollar Savings Bank was organized in Wheeling. The two banks would eventually merge and the combined bank’s leaders were incredibly active in building a better, stronger region. It was the first of many acquisitions and mergers that would allow us to grow with the needs of our customers.  Through the years, we’ve been there as the people of this area fought through the rise and fall of industrial cycles, natural disasters, crop disasters and personal tragedies. And we’ve been inspired by the resilience and optimism of the people we serve. The spirit of our customers drove us to be a better bank then – and it drives us to this day.

This program is in effect for checks, in-person withdrawals, authorized bill pay items, pre-authorized automatic debits, telephone-initiated transfers or other electronic transactions where there are insufficient funds in your account to cover the transaction.  However, ATM and everyday debit card transactions will only be covered if you have opted-in to authorize us to pay overdrafts on these items.  We will charge you a fee of $35 each time we pay an overdraft, up to a limit of five (5) fees per day.

Unlike Overdraft Honor, with overdraft protection you are using your own funds and, as long as you have available funds in the account in which you are transferring from, you will not incur an overdraft fee.  There will be a minimal transfer fee when transferring from a savings or checking. If a personal line of credit is used, you will be subject to paying interest on the transferred amount.

America Saves Designation










































WESBANCO BANK, INC. AGAIN RECEIVES THE AMERICA SAVES DESIGNATION OF SAVINGS EXCELLENCE



Wheeling, WV, June 5, 2017 -


WesBanco, Inc.’s (Nasdaq:WSBC) affiliate, WesBanco Bank was recognized today with the 2017 America Saves Designation of Savings Excellence for its extraordinary efforts during America Saves Week/Military Saves Week to encourage customers to save money. The award is presented annually to financial institutions that succeed in getting people to open and add to wealth-building accounts.
In addition to being an active participant in America Saves Week since its inception in 2007, WesBanco is proud of its more than 11-year partnership with America Saves to provide valuable financial resources to educate and encourage individuals about savings. Across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, WesBanco actively encourages savings year-round with special products designed to encourage wealth building.
“WesBanco is extremely pleased to be recognized by America Saves, for the second consecutive year, for the dedication to our communities demonstrated across our organization. This recognition would not have been possible without the devotion and hard work of our employees, as they once again went above and beyond business as usual during America Saves Week to encourage customers to save. For almost 150 years, WesBanco has maintained its strong community banking roots by focusing on the success of the communities in which we do business. In fact, our employees collectively dedicate thousands of hours per year to savings education, including participation in the Teach Children to Save and Get Smart About Credit initiatives, in addition to America Saves Week,” said Lynn Asensio, WesBanco’s Executive Vice President for Retail.
“This was our most competitive year so far, with institutions engaging in creative ways and offering savings incentives,” said Allie Vered, America Saves Director. “A lot of people don’t believe they can find the money to save. But saving is not an amount, it’s an activity. Convincing consumers to pay themselves first, to hang on to dollars instead of spending, and to take a pledge to achieve a goal go a long way towards helping them develop savings habits. We recognize WesBanco Bank for their efforts to educate and inspire.”
Just two in five American households report making good or excellent savings progress. America Saves Week is an annual opportunity for people to assess their savings status and make a plan to start or increase saving, and for organizations like banks or credit unions to support good savings behavior. America Saves Week is coordinated each year by America Saves and the American Savings Education Council. WesBanco Bank was one of 16 banks and 16 credit unions recognized nationally.
