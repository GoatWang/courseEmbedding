Operations[edit]
Headquartered in Pasadena, California, Tetra Tech has 16,000 associates in 400 offices worldwide.[1] In 2016, Tetra Tech worked on more than 62,000 separate projects in more than 110 countries.[4] Its clients include U.S. commercial, U.S. federal, and U.S. state and local government clients.[1] Commercial clients include companies in the chemical, energy, mining, pharmaceutical, retail, aerospace, automotive, petroleum, and communications industries.[1] No single client, except for U.S. federal government clients, accounted for more than 10 percent of the company’s revenue in fiscal 2014.[1]
The company is organized in two business groups: Water, Environment & Infrastructure (WEI) and Resource Management & Energy (RME).[5]
History[edit]
Tetra Tech, Inc. was founded in 1966—then Water Management Group of Tetra Tech Inc.[4]—by four individuals in Pasadena, California, to provide engineering services to waterways, harbors, and coastal areas.[6] The company has increased its size and scope of business substantially through internal growth and strategic acquisitions.[5] At the end of 2014 Tetra Tech reported gross revenues of $2.5 billion.[5]
Tetra Tech achieved steady growth during its first years designing waterway structures at harbors, ports, and marinas; supporting water quality control projects; supporting oil and gas exploration projects; and calculating the effects of offshore military activities for the Department of Defense.
In 1977 Tetra Tech offered common stock on the American Stock Exchange and used this capital to expand its services, from developing methods to predict the level and frequency of floods and causes of acid rain to environmental impact studies of gas pipeline construction and installing Hydro Products equipment for the U.S. Navy.[6] By 1979, Tetra Tech was helping to analyze data used in exploring Alaska’s North Slope for oil.[4]
In 1982 Honeywell, Inc. purchased Tetra Tech’s U.S. operations and another group acquired Tetra Tech International.[6] Under Honeywell, Tetra Tech’s engineering services, especially environmental, grew steadily. The company phased out gas exploration and related products and phased in data systems.
In 1988 Honeywell sold Tetra Tech’s engineering division to a group of company employees. Dr. Li-San Hwang, who joined the company in 1967, led the new independent Tetra Tech.[7] Honeywell retained the data systems division and a Tetra Tech co-founder to head it. Since its split from Honeywell, the company has grown from 300 employees to more than 13,000.[4]
In 1991 Tetra Tech issued 1.4 million shares of stock on the NASDAQ exchange.[8] The rapid infusion of cash permitted more acquisitions of engineering firms specializing in water resources (urban drainage and flood control), civil engineering (bridges and waterway design), environmental restoration, and hazardous waste cleanup.[6] Gross revenues totaled $96.5 million by 1994.[9]
During the early 2000s, the company’s environmental remediation and water services continued to grow. There was also a transition in executive leadership. In 2005 Dr. Hwang retired, and Dan Batrack, who joined Tetra Tech in the early 1980s, became CEO.[10] His vision of Tetra Tech’s future included servicing new markets in environmental sustainability, renewable energy, and energy efficiency; providing its core services to mining, energy exploration and production, and international development; and construction management.[10]
The remainder of the decade to 2014 involved aggressive growth by acquiring firms in Canada, Australia, and South America in its core (water and infrastructure) and new markets (mining and energy). Tetra Tech also acquired firms that provided international development services to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). These new acquisitions focused on implementing sustainable strategies for water, energy, and the environment in Africa, Asia, and South America and facilitating stability and growth in countries in the aftermath of social conflicts or failed governing institutions.[6]
In 2016, Tetra Tech admitted to providing faked soil samples in San Francisco after being hired to monitor levels of radionuclides, pesticides, petroleum, and other byproducts of shipbuilding and Cold War nuclear experimentation.[11]
Awards[edit]
Tetra Tech received numerous awards for its work in several markets. Among those awards are 31 Federal Energy and Water Management Awards for its projects; 19 Secretary of the Navy Energy Awards for its Navy projects; and 7 Presidential Energy Awards for Leadership in Federal Energy Management.[12] In 2012 the company received the American Council of Engineering Companies’ highest award—The Grand Conceptor—for the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal – Lake Borgne Surge Barrier in New Orleans.[13] The National Safety Council awarded Dan Batrack its 2012 “CEOs Who Get It” award for the firm’s companywide safety excellence.[14] Since 2008 the Environmental Business Journal has given Tetra Tech several awards in its Large Business category for achievement in growth and acquisitions.[15] In 2013 the Small Business Administration awarded Tetra Tech the Dwight D. Eisenhower Award for Excellence for Services for mentoring and subcontracting small businesses in federal procurement.[16]

During the early 2000s, the company’s environmental remediation and water services continued to grow. There was also a transition in executive leadership. In 2005 Dr. Hwang retired, and Dan Batrack, who joined Tetra Tech in the early 1980s, became CEO.[10] His vision of Tetra Tech’s future included servicing new markets in environmental sustainability, renewable energy, and energy efficiency; providing its core services to mining, energy exploration and production, and international development; and construction management.[10]
The remainder of the decade to 2014 involved aggressive growth by acquiring firms in Canada, Australia, and South America in its core (water and infrastructure) and new markets (mining and energy). Tetra Tech also acquired firms that provided international development services to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). These new acquisitions focused on implementing sustainable strategies for water, energy, and the environment in Africa, Asia, and South America and facilitating stability and growth in countries in the aftermath of social conflicts or failed governing institutions.[6]
In 2016, Tetra Tech admitted to providing faked soil samples in San Francisco after being hired to monitor levels of radionuclides, pesticides, petroleum, and other byproducts of shipbuilding and Cold War nuclear experimentation.[11]
Awards[edit]
Tetra Tech received numerous awards for its work in several markets. Among those awards are 31 Federal Energy and Water Management Awards for its projects; 19 Secretary of the Navy Energy Awards for its Navy projects; and 7 Presidential Energy Awards for Leadership in Federal Energy Management.[12] In 2012 the company received the American Council of Engineering Companies’ highest award—The Grand Conceptor—for the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal – Lake Borgne Surge Barrier in New Orleans.[13] The National Safety Council awarded Dan Batrack its 2012 “CEOs Who Get It” award for the firm’s companywide safety excellence.[14] Since 2008 the Environmental Business Journal has given Tetra Tech several awards in its Large Business category for achievement in growth and acquisitions.[15] In 2013 the Small Business Administration awarded Tetra Tech the Dwight D. Eisenhower Award for Excellence for Services for mentoring and subcontracting small businesses in federal procurement.[16]

Operations[edit]
Headquartered in Pasadena, California, Tetra Tech has 16,000 associates in 400 offices worldwide.[1] In 2016, Tetra Tech worked on more than 62,000 separate projects in more than 110 countries.[4] Its clients include U.S. commercial, U.S. federal, and U.S. state and local government clients.[1] Commercial clients include companies in the chemical, energy, mining, pharmaceutical, retail, aerospace, automotive, petroleum, and communications industries.[1] No single client, except for U.S. federal government clients, accounted for more than 10 percent of the company’s revenue in fiscal 2014.[1]
The company is organized in two business groups: Water, Environment & Infrastructure (WEI) and Resource Management & Energy (RME).[5]
History[edit]
Tetra Tech, Inc. was founded in 1966—then Water Management Group of Tetra Tech Inc.[4]—by four individuals in Pasadena, California, to provide engineering services to waterways, harbors, and coastal areas.[6] The company has increased its size and scope of business substantially through internal growth and strategic acquisitions.[5] At the end of 2014 Tetra Tech reported gross revenues of $2.5 billion.[5]
Tetra Tech achieved steady growth during its first years designing waterway structures at harbors, ports, and marinas; supporting water quality control projects; supporting oil and gas exploration projects; and calculating the effects of offshore military activities for the Department of Defense.
In 1977 Tetra Tech offered common stock on the American Stock Exchange and used this capital to expand its services, from developing methods to predict the level and frequency of floods and causes of acid rain to environmental impact studies of gas pipeline construction and installing Hydro Products equipment for the U.S. Navy.[6] By 1979, Tetra Tech was helping to analyze data used in exploring Alaska’s North Slope for oil.[4]
In 1982 Honeywell, Inc. purchased Tetra Tech’s U.S. operations and another group acquired Tetra Tech International.[6] Under Honeywell, Tetra Tech’s engineering services, especially environmental, grew steadily. The company phased out gas exploration and related products and phased in data systems.
In 1988 Honeywell sold Tetra Tech’s engineering division to a group of company employees. Dr. Li-San Hwang, who joined the company in 1967, led the new independent Tetra Tech.[7] Honeywell retained the data systems division and a Tetra Tech co-founder to head it. Since its split from Honeywell, the company has grown from 300 employees to more than 13,000.[4]
In 1991 Tetra Tech issued 1.4 million shares of stock on the NASDAQ exchange.[8] The rapid infusion of cash permitted more acquisitions of engineering firms specializing in water resources (urban drainage and flood control), civil engineering (bridges and waterway design), environmental restoration, and hazardous waste cleanup.[6] Gross revenues totaled $96.5 million by 1994.[9]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Operations[edit]
Headquartered in Pasadena, California, Tetra Tech has 16,000 associates in 400 offices worldwide.[1] In 2016, Tetra Tech worked on more than 62,000 separate projects in more than 110 countries.[4] Its clients include U.S. commercial, U.S. federal, and U.S. state and local government clients.[1] Commercial clients include companies in the chemical, energy, mining, pharmaceutical, retail, aerospace, automotive, petroleum, and communications industries.[1] No single client, except for U.S. federal government clients, accounted for more than 10 percent of the company’s revenue in fiscal 2014.[1]
The company is organized in two business groups: Water, Environment & Infrastructure (WEI) and Resource Management & Energy (RME).[5]
History[edit]
Tetra Tech, Inc. was founded in 1966—then Water Management Group of Tetra Tech Inc.[4]—by four individuals in Pasadena, California, to provide engineering services to waterways, harbors, and coastal areas.[6] The company has increased its size and scope of business substantially through internal growth and strategic acquisitions.[5] At the end of 2014 Tetra Tech reported gross revenues of $2.5 billion.[5]
Tetra Tech achieved steady growth during its first years designing waterway structures at harbors, ports, and marinas; supporting water quality control projects; supporting oil and gas exploration projects; and calculating the effects of offshore military activities for the Department of Defense.
In 1977 Tetra Tech offered common stock on the American Stock Exchange and used this capital to expand its services, from developing methods to predict the level and frequency of floods and causes of acid rain to environmental impact studies of gas pipeline construction and installing Hydro Products equipment for the U.S. Navy.[6] By 1979, Tetra Tech was helping to analyze data used in exploring Alaska’s North Slope for oil.[4]
In 1982 Honeywell, Inc. purchased Tetra Tech’s U.S. operations and another group acquired Tetra Tech International.[6] Under Honeywell, Tetra Tech’s engineering services, especially environmental, grew steadily. The company phased out gas exploration and related products and phased in data systems.
In 1988 Honeywell sold Tetra Tech’s engineering division to a group of company employees. Dr. Li-San Hwang, who joined the company in 1967, led the new independent Tetra Tech.[7] Honeywell retained the data systems division and a Tetra Tech co-founder to head it. Since its split from Honeywell, the company has grown from 300 employees to more than 13,000.[4]
In 1991 Tetra Tech issued 1.4 million shares of stock on the NASDAQ exchange.[8] The rapid infusion of cash permitted more acquisitions of engineering firms specializing in water resources (urban drainage and flood control), civil engineering (bridges and waterway design), environmental restoration, and hazardous waste cleanup.[6] Gross revenues totaled $96.5 million by 1994.[9]
During the early 2000s, the company’s environmental remediation and water services continued to grow. There was also a transition in executive leadership. In 2005 Dr. Hwang retired, and Dan Batrack, who joined Tetra Tech in the early 1980s, became CEO.[10] His vision of Tetra Tech’s future included servicing new markets in environmental sustainability, renewable energy, and energy efficiency; providing its core services to mining, energy exploration and production, and international development; and construction management.[10]
The remainder of the decade to 2014 involved aggressive growth by acquiring firms in Canada, Australia, and South America in its core (water and infrastructure) and new markets (mining and energy). Tetra Tech also acquired firms that provided international development services to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). These new acquisitions focused on implementing sustainable strategies for water, energy, and the environment in Africa, Asia, and South America and facilitating stability and growth in countries in the aftermath of social conflicts or failed governing institutions.[6]
In 2016, Tetra Tech admitted to providing faked soil samples in San Francisco after being hired to monitor levels of radionuclides, pesticides, petroleum, and other byproducts of shipbuilding and Cold War nuclear experimentation.[11]
Awards[edit]
Tetra Tech received numerous awards for its work in several markets. Among those awards are 31 Federal Energy and Water Management Awards for its projects; 19 Secretary of the Navy Energy Awards for its Navy projects; and 7 Presidential Energy Awards for Leadership in Federal Energy Management.[12] In 2012 the company received the American Council of Engineering Companies’ highest award—The Grand Conceptor—for the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal – Lake Borgne Surge Barrier in New Orleans.[13] The National Safety Council awarded Dan Batrack its 2012 “CEOs Who Get It” award for the firm’s companywide safety excellence.[14] Since 2008 the Environmental Business Journal has given Tetra Tech several awards in its Large Business category for achievement in growth and acquisitions.[15] In 2013 the Small Business Administration awarded Tetra Tech the Dwight D. Eisenhower Award for Excellence for Services for mentoring and subcontracting small businesses in federal procurement.[16]

Potomac Park Flood Risk Management Improvements in Washington, DC





















Previous

Next


	Tetra Tech is providing engineering services in two phases to assist the District of Columbia, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to upgrade the flood protection system for the United States’ capital. Two major areas are affected by flooding from the Potomac River—the National Mall area and South East DC. This flood protection system safeguards the downtown DC area from future flooding.

	This project consisted of the design and construction of a post and panel closure structure across 17th Street in Washington, DC. The post and panel closure structure can be put in place when flooding is predicted to occur and will not interfere with access to the National Mall or impact traffic circulation on 17th Street at other times. Gauges upstream of the Potomac River provide the Park Service with 24 hours’ notice to put the system in place to prevent flooding.

	Tetra Tech developed conceptual design plans for a series of alternatives. Our team held a design workshop and a series of working group meetings to vet the alternatives through the National Park Service, the National Capitol Planning Commission, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other interested local agencies. 

	Tetra Tech conducted engineering and structural analyses to prepare the construction plans, technical specifications, and engineer’s estimate for the gate closure. Engineering during construction services included providing responses to requests for information RFIs and reviewing submittals.  

	Tetra Tech successfully addressed multiple challenges during this project. Tetra Tech provided a robust design to attain the required stability to compensate for poor soil conditions. Our team had to maintain access to the area and limit our work during certain time periods because the project site is a heavily used public area and is near the White House. Our underground work also needed to avoid utilities that could impact the surrounding area.

	While the entire design was required to meet Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requirements, Tetra Tech designed the underground infrastructure portion to the higher congressionally mandated level that provides protection against a river discharge of 700,000 cubic feet per second.

	With the gate built and in place, the project is ready to provide protection against a 100-year flood.

	As a follow-on to this project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, contracted Tetra Tech to prepare the levee safety evaluation report. This report was submitted to FEMA and will be used to update the FEMA floodplain maps and change the insurance requirements in the protected areas.

Performance-Based Navigation Development and Integration Support










	The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has tasked Tetra Tech to help improve the technology and functionality of its navigation infrastructure. Tetra Tech provides engineering and technical support for planning, research, development, implementation, sustainment, and decommissioning efforts as the FAA transitions to an integrated ground and satellite-based navigation systems architecture.

	Tetra Tech supports the FAA's modernization initiatives, including its Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) by supporting the design of Performance Based Navigation (PBN) procedures, complying with environmental regulations, performing airspace environmental assessments, and noise footprint evaluations to enable increased capacity and enhance efficiency in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS).

	 The Global Positioning System (GPS) developed by the United States provides users with information on position, velocity, and time worldwide. Together with the European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese Beidou systems, a seamless Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is forming and Tetra Tech has been supporting this transformation of navigation technology for the FAA for nearly 20 years.

	Tetra Tech has been providing the FAA with engineering, technical, operations, and satellite support to expand the capabilities of GPS by implementing new satellite navigation technology to make aviation flight safer, more efficient, and more cost-effective. Tetra Tech assisted in deploying  the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), an FAA-developed system that improves the accuracy, availability, and integrity of GPS.

	GPS and WAAS are the primary enablers for Performance Based Navigation (PBN) to improve capacity, efficiency, access and safety for the NAS. WAAS will eventually enable thousands of conventional navigation facilities to be removed from service, significantly reducing operating costs and capital improvement costs for the FAA. Tetra Tech also provides systems & safety engineering and operations management support to the FAA’s Navigation Services office to rationalize the remaining conventional navigation infrastructure to most effectively enable future NextGen capabilities such as Required Navigation Performance (RNP) and to support development of alternate positioning, navigation, and timing (APNT) services.

	GPS and WAAS are the primary enablers for Performance Based Navigation (PBN) to improve capacity, efficiency, access and safety for the NAS. WAAS will eventually enable thousands of conventional navigation facilities to be removed from service, significantly reducing operating costs and capital improvement costs for the FAA. Tetra Tech also provides systems & safety engineering and operations management support to the FAA’s Navigation Services office to rationalize the remaining conventional navigation infrastructure to most effectively enable future NextGen capabilities such as Required Navigation Performance (RNP) and to support development of alternate positioning, navigation, and timing (APNT) services.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

	Tetra Tech supports cities and municipalities to cost-effectively provide essential services to the public. We help our clients develop potable water supplies, treat wastewater, handle municipal solid waste, and manage the infrastructure at ports and harbors.
