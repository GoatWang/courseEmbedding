(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the financial statements of The Digital Development Group Corp. ("Digital" or the "Company") and the notes which form an integral part of the financial statements which are attached hereto. The financial statements mentioned above have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and are stated in United States dollars.  Overview of Business  The Company develops technologies that provide content owners distribution capabilities across multiple platforms using existing internet protocol ("IP") services. The Company's technology and assets are focused on the opportunity presented by over-the-top ("OTT") home entertainment media, which targets DVD players, video game consoles, Smart TVs and stand-alone internet connected devices which delivers content such as Video-on-Demand services by connecting to users' IP services. The Company's technology is intended to help content owners distribute and monetize their products by delivery to OTT devices. As of the date of this report, the Company has launched 30 channels on the Roku Channel Store, including Media Blasters, Cinema Libre Studio, Kontakt TV, Something Weird, Synapse Films, Sci-Fi Station, Silent Era Films, and G2R Media. The Company plans to launch additional channels. Our business is based in Hollywood, California.  The Company commenced generating revenues from monthly subscribers during March 2013. As of the date of this report, the Company has approximately 3,100 monthly subscribers.  Overview of Business Prior to July 31, 2012  The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 11, 2006 under the name of Regency Resources Inc. ("Regency"). The Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from Regency Resources, Inc. to The Digital Development Group Corp. effective May 2, 2012. Our fiscal year end is December 31. Our executive offices are located at 6630 West Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028.  The Company was a pre-exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. On July 31, 2012 (the "Closing Date"), the Company closed a voluntary share exchange transaction with DDAC and the shareholders of DDAC (the "Selling Shareholders") pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement dated July 31, 2012 (the "Exchange Agreement") by and among the Company, DDAC, and the Selling Shareholders. In accordance with the terms of Exchange Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Company issued 20,000,000 shares of its common stock to the Selling Shareholders in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DDAC (the "Exchange Transaction"). As a result of the Exchange Transaction, the Selling Shareholders acquired 21.93% of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock, DDAC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company acquired the business and operations of DDAC.  Results For The Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 and 2013  Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013 was $58,165 and $27,353 respectively.  Selling, general and operating expenses (S,G&A)  S,G&A for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $1,343,089, compared to $3,409,817 for the six months ended June 30, 2013. S,G&A for the six months ended June 30, 2014 mainly consisted of approximately $726,040 for share based compensation, $106,836 in professional and legal fees, $93,852 in salaries and wages, $93,886 in product development, $41,335 for rent expense and the remainder for daily operating expense for the Company.  Interest expense  Interest expense totaled $1,347,788 during the six months ended June 30, 2014, compared to $556,789 during the six months ended June 30, 2013. Interest expense was primarily the result of amortization and accretion of debt issuance discounts totaling $1,002,101 under convertible notes payable, some of which were accelerated due to conversions and defaults.  Change in derivative liabilities  The derivative liability gain totaled $2.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2014. The change was mainly related to the decrease in fair value of the derivative liability which was the result of the reduction in our stock prices since December 31, 2013.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  As of June 30, 2014, we had cash of $100 and working capital deficit of $6.3 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, net cash used in operations was $760,488 versus $1,050,526 in the prior period. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of common stock and securities convertible into common stock. Given estimates of our Company's future operating results, we are currently forecasting that we will need to secure additional financing to obtain adequate financial resources to reach profitability. As of the date of this report, we estimate that the cash necessary to implement our current business plan for the next twelve months is approximately $1,200,000. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to raise additional funds to meet our cash needs; that the cash required to implement our current plan will not exceed our estimated amount of cash necessary; or that we can achieve profitability with the estimated amounts we determined above, or that we will ever achieve profitability. We also cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to receive additional funds under our production line of credit.  Based on our need to raise additional funds to implement our business plans for the next twelve months, we have included a discussion concerning the presentation of our financial statements on a going concern basis in the notes to our financial statements and our independent public accountants have included a similar discussion, including substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in their opinion on our financial statements through December 31, 2013. We will be required in the near future to issue debt or sell our Company's equity securities in order to raise additional cash, although there are no firm arrangements in place for any such financing at this time. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether we will be able to secure the necessary financing, or the terms of any such financing transaction if one were to occur. The failure to secure such financing could severely curtail our plans for future growth or in more severe scenarios, the continued operations of our Company.  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet.  Aug 27, 2014  (c) 1995-2014 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Digital Development Group Corp (OTCMKTS:DIDG) continues to wallow away in sub penny land in recent weeks. The stock made a nice run in January after the Company announced an Exclusive Streaming Agreement with Amazon.
Rare for a sub DIDG has seen some significant insider buying in recent months; CEO Martin Greenwald owns 20.1 million shares, 15 million of which were purchased on June 27, 2014. R Kopple purchased 17.5 million shares in March, 2014 and Stuart Subotnick purchased 17.9 million shares in March 2014.
Digital Development Group Corp (OTCMKTS:DIDG) offers internet subscriptions to consumers for a wide array of independent content with worldwide appeal. The Company has acquired access to over 5000 titles, and it is continuing to offer a broad mix of horror, cult classics, sci-fi, vintage TV and numerous other genres, as well as adult entertainment through The Movie and Music Network.
DIDG began its initial foray into the streaming video market in 2012 with 4 channels: “Something Weird,” “Synapse Films,” “Sci-Fi Station” and “The Silent Film Channel,” and added eight more channels, including “Cult Epics,” “Salvation Films” and “Media Blasters” during 2013.
In 2014, DigiDev TV transformed into “The Movie & Music Network,” amalgamating all the existing DigiDev TV content plus a growing array of additional channels, including but not limited to, feature films, documentaries, television shows, music videos, music performances and related content.
Since the launch of the Movie & Music Network website and ROKU application March 6th, the Company has seen an approximate 10% increase in subscribers and roughly 15,000 downloads of its application. The simultaneous launch of four new channels brings the total to sixteen channels offered by The Movie & Music Network. Plans are for adding a minimum of ten channels per quarter.
DIDG will Soon Launch a Cannabis Network, BlunTVision that will cater to those who live the cannabis life as well as those of us who are curious. It celebrates the Cannabis Culture while providing a platform for activists, lawmakers, musicians, health practitioners, vloggers and journalists who are all impassioned by one pretty dope plant.

A sister network to The Movie and Music Network, BlunTVision will include dispensary profiles, product reviews, photographs, footage and articles that provide an insight into the world of cannabis. In addition, a weekly show, “Grass Roots” will feature musical guests and hosts with a unique insight into and relationship with the cannabis lifestyle.
On January 29 DIDG said unaudited revenues and expenses for 2014. CEO Martin Greenwald discusses the company’s results. “Revenues rose to $110,483 from $60, 311 in 2013. Even though the numbers are not significant, this is about the direction of the company and clearly we have begun a period of growth.”
“We’re proud of our expense containment efforts. For 2013 our operational expenses were $4,942,160 and for 2014 approximately $2,185,104, that’s over a 55% decrease from 2013. Profitability is the product of increasing revenues and managing expenses. On that front, I am delighted with our results. We will continue to monitor all of our costs and follow our corporate creed of working harder and working smarter.”
CEO Martin W. Greenwald recenty said “The Company has committed to an aggressive marketing campaign set to begin in three weeks. The bulk of our marketing investment targets multiple social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc) and online advertising on the Roku site, which ensures exposure to millions of viewers. With marketing initiatives, channel and title growth and a fast-growing industry, I am confident we will continue to see monthly double-digit growth rates.”

ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

Engineering for inventors







 























ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

Company Summary


OTCBB(DIDG)

Digidev, (Digital Development Group) is a Los Angeles, California based business which provides a seamless, scalable and integrated back-end technological solution giving content owners distribution capability across multiple platforms using existing Internet Protocol (IP) services, providing increased monetization opportunities and greater control over distribution.

“Digidev’s vision offers a simplified online customer management system enabling content providers direct access to consumers and revenues.”
Joe Q. Bretz, Digidev President
Digidev is focused on the opportunity presented by over-the-top (OTT) Home Entertainment Media which targets DVD players and video game consoles, Smart TVs, stand alone internet connected devices such as Roku and Google TV, etc… plus mobile devices with built-in internet connectivity. These devices piggyback on existing network services in consumers homes and offices, pulls content from the Internet and delivers it to the consumers TV set or other display unit. It’s often referred to as “over-the-top” because the services ride “on top” of the service users already have, and doesn’t require any business or technology affiliations, or additional subscriptions with their network provider.

This is a very important distinction to be made, as the ISP in effect is providing the pipeline / distribution channel for the content, but does not interfere with or participate in the actual delivery; rather, the ISP simply transports IP packets. This is a different business proposition than offering Video-on-Demand (VOD) services, where the ISP (which may be a telecommunications company, cable operator or Internet only provider) is handling storage, billing and other logistical and rights oriented responsibilities

The Digital Development Group Signs Exclusive Streaming Agreement With Amazon

Jan 15, 2015, 06:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   The Digital Development Group Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


HOLLYWOOD, Calif., Jan. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Digital Development Group Corp.,  ("DIDG") (OTCBB: DIDG), the Hollywood, California-based online content provider today announced they have signed a deal with Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services), for AWS to be DIDG's exclusive content delivery network (CDN) provider.
Martin W. Greenwald, CEO, describes DIDG's newly signed agreement,  "This is a very important agreement for us.  Effective and efficient delivery of content through all our platforms, Apple, Android, Roku and the Internet are cornerstones to the growth of our business. This agreement guarantees DIDG access to Amazon's world-class global network of servers and storage as well as content management systems available only to their clients."       
Greenwald goes on to say, "In the past 2 weeks we have experienced a 'glitch' in our delivery system and now with Amazon's help, we are rapidly getting the Movie and Music Network back to full capacity.  In addition to the channels we currently have, we've begun the process of uploading hundreds of additional titles.  We are also redesigning our websites with the latest innovations to make the user experience as friendly and easy as possible."
Greenwald also mentions the company's up-and-coming adult network, "We now have two networks up and running, (movieandmusicnetwork.com and 99CentNetwork.com), and are looking forward to the launch of our new network in February, "Miracle Stream," which will aggregate multiple studios in the adult entertainment industry under our roof.  When launched, Miracle Stream will give users the ability to stream hundreds of hours of adult content from the classics of the 1970's to the latest releases of 2015. "
"I anticipate that 2015 will be a banner year for DIDG. The incredible growth of Internet streaming continues, and is an exploding platform throughout the world. Working now with Amazon gives us great comfort knowing that our products will always be available through AWS's reliability, strong worldwide presence, and cost effectiveness that will translate positively to our shareholders and customers."
Additional details of the Company's business can be found in its public disclosures as a reporting issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") EDGAR database.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
