GULFPORT, 
Miss.,  and  NEW  ORLEANS, 
La. (December  22,  2010) — 
Hancock  Holding  Company 




(NASDAQ:  HBHC), parent company of 112
year
old Hancock Bank, and Whitney Holding Corporation 




(NASDAQ: 
 WTNY),  founded  in  1883, 
announced  today  that  they  have 
entered  into  a  definitive 




agreement  for 
Whitney  to  merge  into  Hancock 
in  a  stock for stock  transaction. The 
transaction  was 




approved unanimously by both companies’ boards of directors. 




 




  Under  the 
terms  of  the  agreement,  subject 
to  shareholder  and  regulatory 
approval  and  other 




customary conditions, shareholders of Whitney Holding Corporation will receive 0.418 shares of Hancock 




Holding Company common stock in exchange for each share of Whitney common stock. The value of a 




Whitney share would be $15.48 based on Hancock’s closing price on December 21, 2010 of $37.04, a 




premium of 42 percent to Whitney’s closing price of $10.87 on the same date. 




 




  Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will have approximately $20 billion in 




total  assets, 
$16  billion  in  deposits,  $12 
billion  in  loans,  305  branches, 
390  ATMs,  and  almost  5,000 




employees  across 
the  five  contiguous  states  of 
Texas,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Alabama, 
and  Florida. 




Subject  to 
the  receipt  of  requisite  approvals, 
Hancock  expects  to  repurchase  all 
of  Whitney’s  TARP 




preferred stock and warrants held by the U.S. Treasury at closing.
 




 




 
With anticipated completion in the second quarter of 2011, the merger will combine two of the Gulf 




South’s  most 
respected  financial  services 
leaders.  Hancock  Holding  Company 
expects  to  realize 




substantial cost savings of $134 million on a pre
tax basis once fully phased in by 2013, and anticipates 




that the transaction will be 10 percent accretive to earnings in 2012 and 19 percent accretive once the 




synergies are fully phased in for 2013. Following the merger, Hancock Holding Company expects to retain 




its strong capital position, and anticipates an 8 percent tangible common equity ratio after restructuring 




 



 


  







Whitney Holding Corporation to merge into Hancock Holding Company 





December 22, 2010 





—Add 1— 



 








charges 
and an  anticipated  common  stock 
raise  of  approximately  $200 
million. Five  members  of 
the 


 




Whitney board of directors will join the Hancock board upon completion of the merger. 


 




  


 




  “Hancock 
and  Whitney  were  both  founded 
to  facilitate  commerce  and 
opportunities  for  people 


 




throughout  the 
Gulf  South  region.  For  more 
than  a  century,  both  institutions 
have  served 


 




complementary 
geographical  footprints  according  to 
core  values  that  reflect  the 
spirit  of  those 


 




communities 
—  integrity,  service,  resilience, 
and  teamwork.  We  believe  this 
agreement  presents  an 


 




unprecedented opportunity to enhance shareholder value and strengthen the financial options available 


 




to  individuals 
and  businesses  from  Texas  to 
Central  Florida,”  said  Hancock 
Holding  Company  Chief 


 




Executive Officer Carl J. Chaney. 


 




 




  “The 
merger  of  two  similarly  sized 
companies  with  complementary  cultures 
and  strong  brands 


 




creates the premier banking franchise in the Gulf South,” said Whitney Holding Corporation Chairman 


 




and Chief Executive Officer John C.  Hope, III.  “The organization will be the employer of choice in the 


 




Southeast, 
maintain  a  conservative  management 
culture,  a  commitment  to  strong 
capital  and  a 


 




diversified earnings stream. Joining with a well
known, well respected and well
capitalized company like 


 




Hancock positions us to be even more competitive in the markets where we operate. Not only does this 


 




transaction  create 
significant  shareholder  value,  I 
believe  it  is  also  the  best 
course  of  action  for  our 


 




employees, customers and communities.”

I will now turn the call over to Carl Chaney, President and CEO.
Carl J. Chaney
Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. Let me start today's call by saying how proud I am of our associates and our management team. We've set some very aggressive goals early last year. And as we noted in our release yesterday, we met both of our expense targets for 2014. Not only did we meet the first quarter's target, we also met the fourth quarter's goal, 3 quarters ahead of schedule.
But as I noted in my quote in the release, we are not done. We still have work to do to meet the second part of our initiative, a sustainable efficiency ratio for 2016 of 59% or lower. With expenses in line in order to meet our goal, we will need to generate additional revenue. That means that over the next couple of quarters, you may see expenses rise slightly as we reinvest in higher-return, revenue-generating lines of business. We will use some of the savings from the divestiture of our P&C and group benefits insurance lines we announced a couple of weeks ago.
And as we noted in the release, we are continuing our branch rationalization program and closing more locations across our footprint. But at the same time we're closing branches, we are also opening new locations. We just opened a regional headquarters in Lafayette, Louisiana, a significant market for the oil and gas business. And in a few weeks, we will be opening business financial centers in Houston, Texas and Jacksonville, Florida to support our strategic business focus for those markets. And we have plans on the table to open additional branches and BFCs in more markets during 2014. While you see us investing, it is also important to note that we remain committed to keep the expenses under control and in line with our stated goal for the fourth quarter of '14.

Yesterday, we reported first quarter earnings of $49 million or $0.58 per share and an ROA of 1.05%. We continue the trend of replacing purchase accounting income with core earnings. A combination of lower operating expenses and stability in the net interest margin helped improve the overall quality of our earnings. Operating expenses declined $10 million, linked quarter. And compared to our starting point a year ago, operating expenses are down almost $13 million or 8%. The efficiency ratio improved to 62%, down from 66% last quarter. Core net interest income was flat linked quarter while the core net interest margin narrowed 3 basis points. We had over $230 million in linked-quarter net loan growth or 8% annualized and approximately $1.2 billion or 11% year-over-year loan growth, each excluding the FDIC-covered portfolio.
There was continued improvement in our overall asset quality metrics. And as I noted earlier, our ROA improved to 1.05% and our return on TCE was over 12%. With purchase accounting continuing to run off, it is important for us to continue our efforts to replace it with core earnings, and we're committed to doing just that. While we work on revenue-generating projects, EPS may remain flat in the near term, but the quality of our earnings will continue to improve.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Achary, who will review some of the quarter's results in more detail.
Michael M. Achary
Thanks, Carl, and good morning everyone. Total loans for the company at the end of the first quarter were $12.5 billion. That was up just over $200 million from year end. We back out and exclude the covered loan portfolio, total loans were actually up $231 million or 8% linked-quarter annualized.
We are pleased with the quarter's loan growth, which exceeded our own seasonal expectations of flat growth. The loan portfolio increased in most of our markets across the footprint with the majority of that growth in Houston, Southwest Louisiana, Mississippi, and Central Florida. The growth was diversified across all of our product lines, and we are encouraged by the activity in all of our markets.
While C&I was the biggest driver of the dollar increase, the mix continued to improve with CRE loans making up almost 20% of new loan originations. Construction lending was also up with residential mortgage loans increasing slightly. As a result of the first quarter's activity, we have increased our outlook for loan growth in 2014 from a mid single-digit increase to an upper single-digit increase.
The first quarter also saw higher levels of payoffs and paydowns with also very healthy levels of new loan origination activity. While new loans were booked at levels just under 4%, the runoff rate was higher, compressing the core loan yield by 7 basis points and, in turn, causing a slight 3-basis-point compression in the core NIM. However, the additional loan volume during the first quarter did help offset the loss in net interest income from 2 fewer accrual days this quarter.
Nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, criticized loans and classified loans were all down linked quarter. The total provision for loan losses was virtually unchanged from last quarter. The change in the allowance for loan losses reflected a net reversal of previous impairment on FDIC-covered loans, partly offset by an increase in the allowance on the non-covered loan portfolio. With continued loan growth in the future, the natural migration of some acquired loans to the originated portfolio and the accretion of the remaining discount, we do expect to continue to build the allowance on the non-covered loan portfolio.
Total deposits for the company at March 31 were $15.3 billion. That was down $86 million from year end. Decline was mainly related to seasonal public fund balances, which were down $121 million, linked quarter.

We reported continued stability in our core and reported net interest income and net interest margin. On a reported basis, net interest income was basically unchanged from last quarter despite a decline of $600,000 in loan accretion. Core net interest income was also flat linked quarter. The company's average earning assets were up $364 million linked quarter, reflecting the significant loan growth at the end of the fourth quarter and into the current quarter.
The reported margin and core net interest margin both narrowed 3 basis points in the first quarter. The core loan yield, the 4.02%, did decline 7 basis points and reflects the comments and repricing we mentioned earlier. This compression was partly offset by an improvement in the yield in the bond portfolio of 4 basis points. Our funding costs were flat at 23 basis points.
Noninterest income for the company total $56.7 million. That was down $2.3 million from the fourth quarter. Amortization of the indemnification asset totaled $3.9 million in the first quarter compared to $1.6 million last quarter. This increase reflects a lower level of expected future losses on covered loans. We do expect continued IA amortization through 2014, but at a slightly lower level.
Service charges and card fees, together, were down about $1.6 million from last quarter, partly due to the shorter quarter. Trust investment and insurance fees totaled $18.9 million and were up $800,000 linked quarter. Included in that total was $3.7 million of insurance revenue. As a reminder, we announced the divestiture of our P&C and group benefits insurance lines a couple of weeks ago. Insurance related revenue and expense are both expected to decline by less than $2 million per quarter beginning in the second quarter.
Operating expenses for the first quarter totaled $147 million, this was also our targeted goal for expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014. So as Carl mentioned earlier, we were able to achieve our expense goal 3 quarters early.
Expenses were down just over $10 million linked quarter, excluding $17 million of onetime costs last quarter. Expense reductions were broad-based and reflected the combination of our efficiency activities, which we've been sharing with the market the last few quarters. These activities included a full quarter's impact from recent branch sales and closures, reorganization of market leadership, procurement activities, as well as process improvement and enabling technology initiatives.
All of these aforementioned items will not stop now that we've achieved our expense goal early. For example, branch rationalization is an ongoing process, but we continue to open, close and consolidate branches when warranted. Yesterday, we announced we will close an additional 16 branch locations in Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana in early third quarter 2014. However, as Carl noted in his comments, we also are opening new branches and business financial centers at the same time.
So the takeaway here is that while most of the heavy lifting in terms of expense reductions is now in the rearview mirror, we will continue with our efficiency efforts to create funding for revenue initiatives. So ahead of us is continued investment in revenue initiatives, and revenue growth, all with the focus on achieving our stated goals.
I will now turn the call back over to Carl.
Carl J. Chaney
Thanks, Mike. Before I open the call for questions, I'd like to end on capital. Our TCE ratio was 9.24% at March 31, up 10 basis points from where we were a year ago, even with a $115 million of capital spent on the current 5% buyback program. The current ASR transaction will be completed in May. And based on current stock prices, we expect to receive approximately 600,000 additional shares to close the transaction. We will continue to review future opportunities to manage our strong capital position in the best interest of our shareholders, including additional stock buybacks, organic growth, acquisitions and increased dividends.

We will now open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James.
Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
As we think about going into 2015, with 2014 being kind of a transition year, and as you get towards your -- or move towards your longer-term efficiency target of 57% to 59%, should we think about more the efficiency improvement in '15 coming from revenue as opposed to expenses? And then what are some of the areas outside of some of the new branches that you're going to open that you would invest some of the cost savings into?
Michael M. Achary
Thank you, Michael. This is Mike Achary. Yes, again, I think you hit the nail in the head. Certainly, 2015 -- or 2014, again, is a bit of a transition year as we harvested our expense savings, as we've done, but then also continue the good work to create opportunity to invest in revenue initiatives. That's happening now. That will continue as we move through 2014. And we're really looking for 2015 to be the year where we really begin to show that incremental revenue growth that helps us achieve those targets for 2016. So we talked a lot about, I think, some of the efficiency improvements that we've made in the company. Some of the things that help our lenders and relationship managers create more opportunities to be face-to-face with their customers. That's also involving things that help us remove some of the burdens of the day-to-day operations that those folks have so, again, that they can focus on good customer contact on -- with their customers. So going forward, the things that I think you'll see us invest in will be things that actually help us add, where it's appropriate in certain markets, relationship managers that help us with our commercial, middle market and corporate banking customers. You'll see us add some resources that help us with our mutual fund complex in terms of wholesalers. We have a whole host of initiatives pointed at fee income. Much of that is wealth management, but then also treasury services. And those are the areas that we'll continue to invest in. Carl talked earlier about the BFCs that we're opening and look for more to come in that regard as we head down the road. And then finally, I think I already kind of mentioned this, but additional automation that really helps us become a more efficient company, again with respect to customer contact, freeing up time for our lenders to spend more face time with good customers. So that's really kind of how we're thinking about this year and into next year.
Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then just a follow-up for Carl. You mentioned the 9.2% tangible common ratio. I know -- I think your goal is around 8% where you'd like to optimally operate. Can you discuss the interplay between thoughts on future share buybacks and maybe potential M&A opportunities?
Carl J. Chaney
Sure, Michael. We -- I can assure you, every board meeting that we have, we have a healthy dialogue and discussion about our options. The nice thing is that we have ample options to manage our capital down to where it needs to be in the best of our shareholders. So we're continuing -- are continuously looking at M&A opportunities, as well as running numbers for additional buybacks. So we look at that every board meeting, literally, every board meeting we discuss it. And the nice thing, as I mentioned, is we have options and feel very confident in our ability to execute on one or more of the options that we have to continue to manage our capital.

Our next question comes from the line of Jefferson Harralson with KBW.
Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I want to ask a quick question on a couple of different things. One is the -- your guidance for a flat EPS in the near term. When you say that, are you -- do you mean Q2 or do you mean a handful of quarters? Because it does seem like you have some purchase accounting headwind affecting you in the back half of the year.
Michael M. Achary
Yes, Jefferson, this is Mike. When we talk about that guidance, it really is for the next couple of quarters, so the next 2 or 3 quarters. And you're right, we do have a headwind of the diminishing level of purchase accounting. Between fourth quarter and first quarter, that impact was about $600,000. As we head into the second quarter, probably another $600,000 or $700,000 of kind of projected diminishment. But then as we head into the back half of 2014, those diminishment levels will pick up a bit. So right now, we're looking at somewhere in neighborhood of about $5 million of purchase accounting diminishment in each of the third and fourth quarter. So obviously, we're looking to make that up with all of the efficiency initiatives that we kind of talked about a little bit earlier. So again, that's a mix of continuing to reduce expenses, where appropriate, to create funding for revenue initiatives, and then certainly we're looking for some of those revenue initiatives to begin a payback period little bit later this year.
Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division
All right. Then I'll just ask on the revenue initiatives will be the key to getting where you want to be, I think, in 2016. You mentioned better loan growth. Where is that coming from, and what are you seeing there? And what are the other maybe 1 or 2 main revenue initiatives that need to occur to -- for you guys to meet your '16 goals?
Carl J. Chaney
Well, with the loan growth -- Jeff, this is Carl. Loan growth, we expect to continue to originate where we've had recent success, which is really all across our footprint, all 5 states, generating nice loan growth. And so we're fortunate to be operating in markets that are doing very well economically, from the driving oil and gas industry in Texas, as well as South Louisiana, to the nice recovery we're seeing in Central Florida from Tampa to Jacksonville. So -- and then on the Mississippi Coast, we had some nice loan growth. So we really do expect to see continued growth in those markets as those economies continue to grow and improve.
Michael M. Achary
And yes, Carl, just to add to that, we saw that over the last 2 quarters, again, with a pretty broad base increase in lending activity, really across our footprint. And we certainly expect that to continue going forward. We also have the initiatives that I kind of mentioned in -- at the onset of the call a few minutes ago, and that's pretty broad-based and involves both our margin business, as well as our fee income business. And on the fee income side, again, treasury services and wealth management are really the 2 big areas that we're looking to show revenue increases in the future.
Carl J. Chaney
Yes. In addition to the loan piece, right [indiscernible].
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Emlen Harmon with Jefferies.
Emlen B. Harmon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
So pretty strong loan growth in a quarter where you guys are typically seeing softer growth. Could you give us a sense of what you're seeing on originations the past couple of quarters, just whether those are picking up or the -- whether the loan growth that we've seen is more an effect of just not as much runoff in some of your loan books?
Michael M. Achary
We've had really good production in the last couple of quarters and very pleased with that aspect of our activity. Paydowns have been a little bit uneven quarter-to-quarter. And certainly, in the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit in the way of lessening of that. And I think when we get to the first quarter, as we get to the first quarter, probably back into more of a normalized level of paydowns.

Carl J. Chaney
Yes. I would say that in the first quarter, we actually had our typical paydowns. It's just that we were able to have very strong loan originations, which allowed that typical first quarter softening of net loan growth to not occur this time. So originations, to your point, have been very strong for the last couple of quarters in a row.
Emlen B. Harmon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Got you. And are you -- did -- the loan growth that you guys are seeing, is that market-share driven, or do you feel like there's actually -- the market, the lending market, is actually growing as a whole?
Samuel B. Kendricks
This is Sam. I would put it in both of those categories. We're seeing improvements in economic activity in some of our key markets, as well as the fact that we're picking up some relationships that we think are meaningful. And so we're seeing acquisition of relationships, as well as a general lift of the tide, so to speak, in some of these markets. So we're very encouraged on both those fronts.
Emlen B. Harmon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Got you. And, Mike, just one last quick one, excuse me. You gave us the revenue impact from the insurance sale. Is there anything that we should be thinking about taking out on the expense side as well?
Michael M. Achary
Yes. We talked a little bit earlier about a $2 million quarterly impact, both on the revenue side, as well as the expense side.
Emlen B. Harmon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Got you...
Michael M. Achary
That would be the way to think about it going forward.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson.
Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
My questions have really been answered, but I do have a question. On the new offices that you said you plan on opening soon in Houston and Jacksonville, how do those offices -- can you just describe those offices? Are they just a business branch, or how does that differ from a regular branch?
Carl J. Chaney
Yes. Jennifer, this is Carl. Those are -- we call those business financial centers. And I apologize, sometimes we use the acronym BFCs. Those are commercial-oriented branches. And so when you walk in, they should not look like a typical retail branch in the sense that you don't see a large teller line, rather you walk in, it looks like a business office with professional desk around. We also do accepting in deposits and do transactions, but it certainly doesn't look like a retail branch. It is clearly focused on commercial lending and commercial banking. And so it's -- and they're typically located in business complexes, office complexes, oftentimes in the first floor of a office tower. And we have 2 opening up in a matter of just a couple of weeks, one in Houston and one in Jacksonville. And those -- that represents our strategy for markets like that, where we don't have a very large market share. We're going in with a very niche strategy play and going after commercial and high-end private banking. And so that has worked for us in the past, and so we're very confident we'll be able to continue to lever off of that strategy. As opposed to markets like New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the Mississippi Coast, where we have large market share, we have your typical retail branches, as well as our strong commercial activity.
Michael M. Achary
And, Carl, that was actually all part of our kind of strategic realignment that we talked about a year ago.
Carl J. Chaney
Yes.
Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And my second question is on M&A. Can you just talk about the pipeline as it stands now and remind us of what kind of deals you're examining and you're willing to pursue? And have you backed away from any opportunities in the last 3 to 6 months?

Carl J. Chaney
I'd say the M&A market or activity has -- is continuing to grow. It is not -- I'm not going to say it's taking off, but it is growing slightly, gradually, maybe is the best way to describe it. I will say that the quality of the books that we're starting to see continues to improve. Whereas 18 months ago, I would tell you the quality was significantly less. So that's encouraging. As far as our sweet spot, we can do up to $10 billion, $12 billion of acquisition fairly easily, but that's not our sweet spot. We're going -- I would describe our ideal target being anywhere from $1 billion to $2 billion up to $5 billion or $6 billion. That is our sweet spot. We could do one of those transactions and fold that in very nicely and not have it be a major distraction and continue with our other initiatives, which are important. So while we have -- we're still looking forward to continuing to grow our revenue, we like to look at those smaller acquisition opportunities, at the same time, that could fold in. Have we backed off? We've -- I guessed we've passed. I think maybe this is what you were referring to. There have been 2 fairly recent deals that we looked at and decided to pass on, just because they're -- they weren't strategic in our mind. But one nice thing, Jennifer, is we don't have to do a transaction right now, and so that allows us to be patient and be very deliberate and -- in our M&A thoughts. And so we would -- we will pull the trigger when the right strategic opportunity presents itself in, and we're very confident that, that will occur.
Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
I have one more question, if I can. If you were to look at an opportunity in Texas, would it have to be in a Houston or Dallas and what's your thought on that market in general?
Carl J. Chaney
I mean, Houston market is fantastic as far as how the economy is working, and our results in that market have been very, very strong and positive. If something were to come available in Houston, and it had also some branches, let's just say, in Dallas, that's not a no go. We can certainly -- we'd certainly do that easily. Now if it was something in West Texas, that's not really in our radar screen right now. That's another thing that's -- we're fortunate about is that we are already in markets that we believe will provide ample opportunities for strategic expansion without having to go significantly outside of our existing footprint.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Clark with Crédit Suisse.
Matthew T. Clark - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I guess first question really on the core margin outlook. I mean, I think there had been some expectation for things stabilizing there with the mix change, and I think pricing has incrementally gotten better. That differential has closed. Can you just give us a sense for how you see that core margin going forward and maybe also what kind of pricing you're seeing quarter-to-quarter?
Michael M. Achary
Matt, this is Mike. Again, if you look back over the last 5 quarters, especially, our core net interest margin really has been kind of the picture of stability. We've had a quarter or 2 where we're maybe up a couple of basis points. This quarter we were down a couple of basis points. And we've been able to achieve that more recently through the volumes that we've been able to put on the balance sheet on a net basis and also an improvement in the mix of loans that we're putting on the balance sheet, so a little bit fuller mix. All of that is taking place in what continues to be a very challenging environment to price loans, and that will continue going forward. So we're going to have that challenge, and we're going to have -- a little bit of that potential for a little bit in the way of a downward movement in our core loan yields. So our objective is to obviously maintain that core NIM stability and to continue to grow our levels of net interest income. And we think as we go through the year, we'll be able to achieve that. So again, we may see the net interest margin, the core net interest margin trend down a basis point or 2 as we go through the rest of the year. But the objective is to increase our level of net interest income.

Matthew T. Clark - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Got it, okay. And then as you look beyond, say, the next couple of quarters, and I guess I'm just trying to get at maybe the underlying assumptions behind achieving that 57% to 59% core efficiency ratio in 2016. I guess when we think about expenses beyond this year, I mean, is it fair to assume that they're going to be flat or down? And I guess what type of -- I understand some of the initiatives that are in place on the revenue side. But also just trying to get a sense for your assumptions on maybe rates and any -- maybe pickup from the type of growth -- of a loan growth that you're putting on today.
Michael M. Achary
Well, going forward, on the expense side, again, as we've kind of talked about, we're continuing our efficiency efforts and we intend to continue to do that to create funding opportunities to invest back in the company. So again, going forward, we'll be very careful and transparent to kind of show what those actions and activities have been. And I think what we'll see is, once you kind of back out the investments that we've made, you'll see just kind of a marginal continued increase in expenses, somewhere in line with the rate of general inflation. So there's always going to be a little bit in the way of expense increases that are just kind of baked into the numbers for that reason going forward. And as far as the second question about the revenue component, again, we've talked a lot about that. We're very focused on continuing the level of loan growth that we've put in place the last couple of quarters, increasing that going forward and, at the same time, investing in revenue-generating initiatives, many of which are pointed squarely at our fee income lines of business and, again, wealth management. So trusts and investments are big areas that we're investing in, as well as treasury management.
Matthew T. Clark - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. But no change in rates in '16? I mean, do you assume some benefit of higher rates or no?
Michael M. Achary
No. I'm sorry, no. Again, when we set up these targets a year ago, they were under the assumption that while certainly an increase in the interest rate environment would help us, it's not something we're counting on. So by the time we get to 2016, if we haven't had a rate increase, you know that the goals are still out there and our intent is to achieve those goals.
Matthew T. Clark - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And then just a housekeeping item. How much of that -- the latest increase in C&I came from the shared national credits?
Carl J. Chaney
Let's see, in terms of the total increase in overall loans, it was less than 30%. The total loans on the C&I piece, let's see here, I believe it's -- I'm not sure I've got that number handy here.
Michael M. Achary
I believe, it was in the $60 million to $65 million range, right.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Olney with Stephens.
Matt Olney - Stephens Inc., Research Division
I want to go back to Matt's question on the core margin. Can you guys disclose what the average yield is on the new and renewed production for the first quarter, and how has this changed from the previous quarters?
Michael M. Achary
Yes. Matt, if we look back over the last couple of quarters, it really is showing a little bit of an upward trend. Again, it's not linear quarter-to-quarter. But the yield that new loans came on the books last quarter was right around 370 basis points, and that has moved up to about 380 or so this quarter.
Matt Olney - Stephens Inc., Research Division
Okay, Mike. And going back to the sale of the business line within the insurance business, are sales of other businesses still on the table at this point, or would this just be limited to just the insurance business?

Carl J. Chaney
Matt, it's Carl. I would say that -- I wouldn't expect any additional sales of lines going forward. We -- as I'm -- I guess it was our annual shareholder meeting 2 days ago, and I had a question similar to that. And I responded like this, we stack rank all of our lines of business from a profitability standpoint and from a profit margin. And while our commercial insurance loan business was profitable, it was at the very bottom of that stacking. And so we feel very, very comfortable and confident in our ability to sell that for a nice premium, turn around and take that investment and reinvest that into higher profit margin lines of business that we're currently operating in, that we know we can do very, very well. And so that's -- in its most simplest terms, that's exactly what we executed. And we feel very confident in our ability to generate significantly more revenue and -- that flows to the bottom line than we -- with a similar investment than we were generating with the commercial insurance line. So I don't see though -- looking at the other stack rankings, I don't see any other lines of business that it would necessarily make strategic to exit in order to reinvest as we did the commercial insurance.
Michael M. Achary
And, Carl, that really is kind of what we're doing in a way with our branch network.
Carl J. Chaney
Absolutely, yes. Moving -- particularly those markets where -- large markets where we have relatively small market share, moving away from the retail strategy and the retail branch and taking that money. And that's not an expense play, but that's reinvesting that money into more strategic business financial centers, where we know we can be much more profitable. So again, that's a similar concept that we're executing.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Marinac with FIG Partners.
Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division
Given the comment in the press release about the return on assets at 1.05%, I guess I'm curious if, directionally, we should see this get better next year with these investments, Mike. Is that realistic?
Michael M. Achary
Yes, that's correct.
Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division
Okay, great. And then if you or Carl just talk to us a little bit about the priorities in between buyback, dividend and M&A. And could you rank those, or is there a sort of one that's preferred over the others?
Carl J. Chaney
I -- Chris, I don't know if I would -- if I can really give you a priority. The priority is we will do -- we will execute on one, if not both of those. I feel pretty confident that -- because we have very strong capital as everyone seems to point out, which is not a bad thing. It does create nice options for us. And we will manage that capital in a fashion that we think is in the best interest of our shareholders. And so to be able to say -- to prioritize between M&A and stock buybacks, we don't have a deal in hand. And so no, I'd say I couldn't rank those one over the other. I'll just say that we're going to pursue both and make the right strategic decisions.
Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division
Okay, great. And then maybe just a final point. Where are you on the stress test process and sort of what's coming out, coming forward on that process?
Michael M. Achary
When you say stress test, you mean the DFAST requirements, right, Chris?
Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division
Right, yes.
Michael M. Achary
We filed our DFAST results a couple of weeks ago, and so that is done and behind us. And I suppose like most other banks out there, we're going through a review from our examiners, which is a kind of normal and customary thing. And that will conclude that process for this year. And of course, that's kind of a continuous process, not only the DFAST stress testing, but our normal stress testing that we do as part of our capital management and capital planning process.

Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division
And you're still waiting to hear back feedback in terms of what capital impact there is, if any?
Michael M. Achary
What's that now? From the examiners or...
Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division
Correct.
Michael M. Achary
Yes. And again, given the size that we are, the $10 billion to $50 billion banks, I don't know that the examiners are going to come back and give pass or fail grades or anything of that nature. It really is just an effort to comply with the regulations and to help us assess our capital going forward against the different scenarios that have been established.
Carl J. Chaney
We don't anticipate any issues coming out of that whatsoever.
Michael M. Achary
Not at all.
Carl J. Chaney
We have a very close relationship with all of our regulatory authorities. And obviously, they've been very closely aligned to us as we've been going through this process of the stress testing, DFAST, and submitting that. We don't anticipate any issues coming out of it whatsoever.
Michael M. Achary
And then just as a reminder also and, again, this is in accordance with the DFAST regulations or Dodd-Frank, there's no public disclosure of those results for this year. For next year, however, in one form or another, some form of the results are projected to be or scheduled to be disclosed, but nothing for this year.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mikhail Goberman with Portales Partners.
Mikhail Goberman - Portales Partners, LLC
I was wondering if you guys could perhaps give some color on energy lending and trends in that space in Houston and Louisiana.
Carl J. Chaney
Yes, sir. The -- that segment continues to be very strong. We've had opportunities to continue to expand in that space. It's not the primary driver of our growth this quarter, obviously, but we're seeing continued strength there between the production side, as well as the support industries. So we've got a broad base of clients and industries that support energy in general, whether it's upstream for the exploration production or it's non-drilling support or direct drilling support or just the other support industries, transportation, product transportation, et cetera. So we're seeing pretty broad-based opportunities across the whole -- entire energy segment.
Mikhail Goberman - Portales Partners, LLC
Great. And if I can just circle back to the insurance divestment. I'm sorry if this is kind of a repetition of maybe something you went over. So you said the insurance fees are going to be down about $2 million beginning in Q2?
Michael M. Achary
That's correct. That's correct.
Mikhail Goberman - Portales Partners, LLC
From the current level of $3.7 million, is that right?
Michael M. Achary
That's right, yes.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Peyton Green with Sterne Agee.
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
A question. I was wondering, Mike, if you could touch on maybe what the headcount was for the combined company in the first quarter, maybe if you could frame that in the context of where it was a year ago and a quarter ago.
Michael M. Achary
Yes. Right now, Peyton, our headcount, this is on a FTE basis, is just under 4,000. So if we go back a year to the first quarter of '13, we were just under 4,200. So we're down year-to-year about 200.
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. And -- so I mean, that's flat versus the fourth quarter, and yet -- I mean, there's a big change in personnel expense, I mean, $3.5 million linked quarter. Was there any kind of bonus accrual that got reversed out that maybe you had accrued over the last year that was due that didn't get paid in the first quarter or maybe -- because, I mean, that's a huge change just on a fairly limited headcount reduction in the personnel expense.

Michael M. Achary
No. No significant accruals this quarter or really last quarter or reversals or adjustments. I think what you're seeing here is really the full quarter impact again of all the activities and actions that we really began executing on as we went through the fourth quarter of last year. So again, the numbers that I quoted, really, were end-of-period numbers. And so again, it really is a full quarter's impact, the very thing that we've done and put into place. That make sense?
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Yes -- no, I guess, I mean, just compared to -- I know back in the old, old days, 12, 13 years ago, when you all did a 5% reduction in force, I mean, the effect of that was not as dramatic on a per FTE basis, I guess, is just the way I'm thinking about it. So it just seemed like there might have been something else going on, but all right. And so you would expect there to be a little bit more downside on that number based on the insurance company being -- I mean, the P&C brokerage business moving out, plus the branches, but the branch closures would be offset by investment in other noninterest income businesses.
Michael M. Achary
That's correct. That's exactly the way we're thinking about it. And again, at the very onset of the call, we mentioned some of the initiatives and many of those initiatives involve bringing into the company new relationship managers, where appropriate and, we believe, necessary.
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay, great. Was there anything in the other line that you might caution us to use the $43 million as the run rate, or is that a good run rate plus a little inflation going forward?
Michael M. Achary
No. It really is a pretty good run rate. And one of the things that we strove for and, obviously, I think we were able to achieve this quarter is the expense reductions weren't aggregated up into one category or one market or one line item on the income statement. It was pretty broad-based. And so it represented, again, the culmination of all the things that we've been talking about and talked about a little bit earlier in the call. All really manifested itself in a full quarter's impact in the first quarter, which is, again, the way we had kind of set up the plan of the program.
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then I guess on the personnel, not to be a stickler about this, but I guess I've kind of forgotten. When are the merit bases -- merit pay raises that you would normally incur? Was that in the first quarter, or is that a second quarter?
Michael M. Achary
No. And again, we do have a merit increase process or salary evaluation process that typically happens sometime in the middle of the second quarter of every year. But again, salary review and salary administration is something that takes place throughout the year. So it's not necessarily like maybe the old days you were referring to where everybody in the company got a raise on a certain day. It really -- we have really strove to kind of spread that out and make that a kind of continuous process. Having said that, there will be some salary increases that'll be reflected in the second quarter numbers.
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay, all right. And then separately, in terms of the deposit growth in the quarter, I know, historically, on your side, on the Hancock legacy side of the business, there was pretty good seasonality...
Michael M. Achary
Yes.
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
On the deposit flows in first quarter that would roll out by the end of the first quarter. How would you guide us to think about earning asset growth maybe in the second and third quarters in the context of that?

Michael M. Achary
Yes. And you're exactly right. And I think we mentioned a little bit earlier some of the seasonality in the public fund book, which was kind of a legacy Hancock attribute. So sure enough, I mean, we're seeing those impacts as we go through the first quarter. And even on the Whitney legacy side. Now, typically, you'd see a little bit of an increase in, primarily, the corporate deposits that would happen around year end and then a little bit of an outflow as you go through the first and second quarter. Going forward, to answer your question, I think that on a net-net basis, second quarter will probably be kind of flattish in terms of earning asset growth. But I think in the back half of the year, we'll see a little bit in the way of an upward movement in our earning asset base as we strive to fund our loan growth through methods other than just relying on cash flow from the bond portfolio.
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. So I mean, is it dependent on deposit growth being positive, or would you borrow money to fund loan growth and just utilize capital that way?
Michael M. Achary
Really the answer is all those things, Peyton. Those are all things that we have done, are considering doing and potentially will do going forward.
Operator
I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Carl Chaney for closing remarks.

Good morning, and welcome to Hancock Holding Company's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Participating in today's call are Carl Chaney, President and CEO; Mike Achary; CFO; Sam Kendricks, Chief Credit Officer; Steve Barker, Chief Accounting Officer; and Trisha Carlson, Investor Relations Manager. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Trisha Carlson. You may begin.
Trisha Voltz Carlson
Thank you, and good morning. During today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. We would like to remind everyone to review the Safe Harbor language that was published with yesterday's release and presentation and in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q. Hancock's ability to accurately project results or predict the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently limited. We believe that the expectations reflected or implied by any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Hancock undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The presentation slides included in our 8-K are also posted with the conference call webcast link on the Investor Relations website. We will reference some of these slides in today's call. I will now turn the call over to Carl Chaney, President and CEO.
Carl J. Chaney
Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we reported second quarter earnings in line with the Street's expectations of $46.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Highlights on the quarter included approximately $245 million linked quarter net loan growth or 9% annualized and, $760 million or 7% year-over-year loan growth, excluding the FDIC-covered portfolio. Loan growth was solid across the company's footprint with all markets contributing to the overall growth in the quarter. The quarter's solid performance reflected an improvement in our core results, a trend we expect to build on in the future. As we noted in the past, our core results -- or our reported results led the impact of net purchase accounting adjustments.
Our reported core revenue improved for the quarter with core net interest income and net interest margin relatively stable and growth in our fee income lines of business. Our results reflected continued improvement in overall asset quality metrics, and we initiated a 5% common stock repurchase in May. In conjunction with the expense and efficiency initiative we announced with last quarter's results, we also previously announced the expected closure of approximately 40 branches across our footprint. Earlier this week, we announced that we have signed agreements to sell 10 of those 40 retail locations along with the loans and deposits in those branches. 3 of the branches are in Alexandria, or Central Louisiana, and 7 are small regional branches in Houston. These transactions continue our local commitment to the communities by keeping both jobs and business opportunities in these markets.

At this time, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Achary, who will review some of the quarter's results in more detail.
Michael M. Achary
Thanks, Carl, and good morning, everyone. As Carl noted, net income for the second quarter was $46.9 million or $0.55 per diluted common share. That was down slightly from $48.6 million or $0.56 last quarter. The biggest driver of the decline in earnings on a linked-quarter basis is related to accretion.
In the first quarter, we had $7.5 million pretax or about $0.06 per share of excess cash recoveries in our accretion numbers. For the second quarter, we had $3.1 million pretax or $0.02 per share of similar accretion levels. That's about a $4.4 million negative impact to reported net interest income and a good example of the volatility inherent in our numbers, which we talked a lot about over the last few quarters.
As Carl mentioned, we did have success in growing the company's net loan portfolio during the quarter. Total loans at June 30 were $11.7 billion, up almost $200 million from March 31. We backed out the FDIC-covered loan portfolio, which did decline $46 million during the quarter. Total loans increased $245 million or about 2.2% linked quarter but 9% annualized. The largest component of net loan growth during the quarter was in the C&I portfolio with a small increase in residential mortgage loans.
Net interest income for the second quarter was $172 million, down almost $5 million linked quarter. Average earning asset levels were virtually unchanged. As mentioned, $4.4 million of the decline was related to a lower level of purchase accounting-related accretion mainly related to the volatility from excess cash recoveries. In the slide presentation on our website, we've added detailed information on the purchase accounting items in our quarterly results. The schedule on Slide 11 details accretion on both the Whitney and Peoples First acquired portfolios, the excess cash recoveries in each quarter and then finally, the premium on the bond amortization related to the Whitney bond portfolio. This will help reconcile reported and core results and hopefully help everyone understand the dynamics in these numbers.
The net interest margin was 4.17% for the second quarter, down 15 basis points from 4.32% in the first quarter. The core margin of 3.38% was relatively stable during the quarter and compressed only 3 basis points, while core net interest income was down slightly. We hope that with the initiatives currently in place on loan volume, pricing and mix, we will see a trade-off of margin for core net interest income in the near term. This will help position us well for an eventual rise in interest rates.
Helping drive the improvement in core revenue was the additional $4 million of fee income generated in the quarter. The increase reflects some seasonality in lines of business, such as trust and insurance, but also includes healthy levels of new business. Additionally, higher stock market values did help some fee-generating lines.
We talked a lot about expenses last quarter and the company's efficiency initiatives. We are very focused on this initiative and have a clear line of sight to deliver the first $25 million in expense reductions by the first quarter of 2014. In coming quarters, we will begin to discuss additional specifics of the overall plan. Meanwhile, noninterest expense for the second quarter was up $2.6 million or about 2% from last quarter. The driver of that increase was mainly related to a $2.6 million increase in ORE expense to a total of $3.4 million in the second quarter. This expense category can be somewhat volatile from period to period, and we expect to operate in a range somewhere between the first and second quarter levels in the near term.

At the Gulf South Bank Conference in May, we announced plans to close about 40 branch locations across our 5-state footprint as part of the expense reduction initiative. Earlier this week, as Carl noted, we reached agreements to sell 10 of those retail branch locations. A significant portion of the cost savings targeted for the first quarter of 2014 will be derived from these closures and resulting sales. We plan to close a majority of the branches on or about August 30 of 2013, with the remaining branches scheduled to close or be sold by year end. We expect the one-time cost associated with the branch closures and sales to be booked in the third quarter. These costs are expected to be lower than the previous guidance of between $18 million and $22 million. The branch sales will be reflected in our fourth quarter results.
And finally, before I turn the call over to Sam, I would like to quickly remind everyone of the ASR transaction Carl mentioned earlier. The ASR, or accelerated share repurchase, was initiated on May 9 with Morgan Stanley. We received 2.8 million shares or 70% of the amount projected to be repurchased based on the company stock prices at that time. As of today, we expect to receive about 1 million additional shares associated with this transaction. We will receive these shares no earlier than November and no later than next May. At that point, we'll be able to determine the average repurchase price. I will now turn the call over to Sam Kendricks, our Chief Credit Officer.
Samuel B. Kendricks
Thank you, Mike. As Carl mentioned earlier, we're seeing continued improvement in our asset quality metrics. Nonperforming assets totaled $216 million at June 30, that's down $13 million from March 31. The nonperforming asset ratio was 184 basis points at June 30 compared to 198 basis points last quarter. The decrease in overall NPAs reflects our continued success in selling ORE properties during the quarter with our net reduction of $7 million. The reduction in nonperforming loans of $5 million was mainly related to payoffs and paydowns in the NPL categories. The level of ORE may be volatile in the near term as problem credits from the Peoples First covered portfolio work their way to the foreclosure process. Additionally, we have seen increase as the branch's closing connection with the efficiency initiative move into surplus back property.
Net charge-offs from the non-covered loan portfolio were $7 million, that's 24 basis points of average loans in this quarter. That's up slightly from $6.6 million or 23 basis points in the first quarter. During the second quarter, we recorded total provision for loan losses of $8.3 million, that's down from $9.6 million in the first quarter. The provision for non-covered loans was $7.9 million and that compares to $3 million in the first quarter of 2013. The increase was mainly related to the increased volume of new loans originated during the second quarter.
Now during the second quarter, the net provision from the covered portfolio was $400,000 and that compares to $6.6 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, the first quarter provision for covered loans included approximately $6.5 million of impairment related to changes in the estimated timing of cash flows, which does not have an offsetting impact on the loss share receivable. The allowance for loan losses was $138 million at the end of the second quarter and that's virtually unchanged from March 31. The ratio of the allowance to period-end loans was 118 basis points, down slightly from 120 basis points at March 31. The allowance maintained on the originated portion of the portfolio totaled $76.4 million or 93 basis points of related loans at June 30, up from $75.5 million or 102 basis points at the end of the first quarter.

Finally, as noted on Slide 7, we have seen a reduction of over $600 million in criticized loans, excluding the FDIC-covered portfolio over the past 2 years. Our staff has worked very hard to either move these credits off the balance sheet or rehab and upgrade them to performing credits, and we will continue our efforts to work through the problem credits that remain in our portfolio today.
I will now turn the call back over to Carl.
Carl J. Chaney
Thanks, Sam. As you can see, we had a very solid quarter and our underlying trends and fundamentals are positive, such as loan growth in the high single-digit annualized level, improved asset quality, improvements in fee generation, goals were in place for expense cuts and for becoming a more efficient organization, strategic deployment of excess capital through the current buyback program and continuing to build on that strong capital to allow us to take advantage of future strategic opportunities including additional buybacks, organic growth, dividends or acquisitions. We are better positioned to succeed in today's economic environment and thrive when there's an eventual, sustain, positive turn in the overall economy. We will now open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Rose from Raymond James.
Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Just wanted to get your thoughts outside of the share repurchase program, what you would view as the order of priority or magnitude for capital deployment opportunities?
Carl J. Chaney
Well, outside of the buyback, of course, we want to make sure we maintain sufficient capital for the growth in our earning assets that we see coming in the future quarters as we did this quarter. And then, of course, we think there'll be some strategic opportunities for acquisitions as well. And then we're always looking at our dividend payout ratio and when those -- when changes are warranted in the payout, then we'll certainly entertain those as well.
Michael M. Achary
And, Carl, certainly, once this repurchase is complete, the door is certainly open to considering an additional repurchase. Hope that makes sense.
Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay, that's helpful. And then, just secondarily on the -- once you achieve the cost savings, I mean, where are you taking those savings in redeploying those savings into revenue production? Are you trying to hire more teams in select markets? Are you trying to build out certain lines of business? Any color there would be helpful.
Michael M. Achary
Yes, Michael. This is Mike. Certainly, those are things that we'll be doing as we go through this initiative that is redeploying those resources into, certainly, revenue-based lines, as well as other investments throughout the company's footprint. This is about making the company more efficient, but it's also about improving our opportunities to generate revenue.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kevin Fitzsimmons from Sandler O'Neill.
Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division
The loan growth in C&I seem like it was definitely a strength this quarter and I was wondering if you could just dig in a little further to that with what markets you were seeing strength, and whether you think that kind of growth is something that would continue? Or was there something unusual about this quarter that caused it to jump?
Carl J. Chaney
Kevin, the loan growth was actually spread across the footprint, which is a good thing from my perspective. And as far as being able to look out, we don't think -- it certainly wasn't tied to any unusual activity that took place during the quarter. When we look at the pipeline, we see a very strong pipeline. And so we feel very confident in our ability to continue to post strong loan growth for the foreseeable future and the quarters coming.

Michael M. Achary
Yes. Kevin, this is Mike. And just to reiterate Carl's point, the growth was pretty sustained across the footprint. I think that's one of the big positives. If we look at again where that growth came from, probably was a little bit more weighted towards the west side of the franchise. That would be Southeast Louisiana, of course, into Texas. But we're very pleased with the growth that we experienced also in Florida, Alabama and even decent production levels in Mississippi. So it was a pretty broad base.
Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division
Okay, great. That's helpful. And maybe if you guys could just touch on, I think you alluded to it in your comments, but just generally how you'd characterize your impact to rising rates both what we've seen recently with the rise of short-term rate -- or long-term rates, rather, but then longer term when we see a pickup in short-term rates?
Michael M. Achary
Sure, absolutely. And again, as you know, we're asset sensitive in a pretty significant way. So rising rates will certainly benefit our company going forward, especially when you consider the positive mix that we have, the high level of non-interest-bearing deposits, which are not worth a whole lot right now in this environment to take on obviously added value as rates begin to rise. So, that's something that obviously we're looking forward to.
Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division
How about just with -- in the near term with what has happened with the tenure. Any -- does it at least alleviate a little bit the reinvestment situation that we have before couple quarters ago?
Michael M. Achary
Yes, it certainly helps anytime the yield curve steepens, that's a good thing and good thing for banking and that's something we believe we'll be able to take advantage of, assuming that continues into the future. On a very short-term basis, it hasn't had a whole lot of impact yet, but we believe that's yet to come.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matthew Clark from Crédit Suisse.
Matthew T. Clark - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Just as a follow-up to that last question. I think, new production you guys are putting on an average 3.3% to 3.4%. I think your core yield is 4.23%, any -- doesn't sound like there's much of a change there on pricing or has there been?
Michael M. Achary
A little bit of a change, yes. We talked about last quarter the new production came on at about 3.35%. This quarter, it was probably in the 3.20% to 3.25% range, so that compressed a little bit and, again, that was due more than anything else to the weighting of the way the growth came on the balance sheet. That is mostly in the C&I portfolio. And again, going forward, like we've talked about so many times, we have initiatives in place that will, hopefully, help us deliver a little bit fuller mix of loans going forward, and by that we mean, more investor real estate and other forms of real estate that will give us a little bit fuller yield.
Matthew T. Clark - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay, and then what portion of the C&I came from smix [ph] -- the growth there?
Carl J. Chaney
We had an increase in smix [ph] of about $130 million or so from last quarter.
Matthew T. Clark - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
And then lastly, with the branch sales, I guess a 2-part question. You have 10 locked up, ready to go, and it sounds like you had $55 million, $60 million loans and deposits going with that. Any sense, though, be it the 30, how much -- I'm just trying to get the sense for what you need to overcome to still grow here with what might be sold in the other 30?
Michael M. Achary
Well, at this point, Matt, we have no impending announcements related to the other 30, and there's nothing that we're, at this point in time, working on. But we're still going through the marketing effort and still certainly is possible that we can have some success in selling some of the other branches that are scheduled for closure.

Matthew T. Clark - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And then just -- with this -- you fine-tuning the business model and the strategy and approach in each of your markets, can you give us a sense as you fine-tune commercial versus retail of both, how that's going so far? And maybe what underlying attrition you're assuming?
Carl J. Chaney
Yes, I'd say we've had, actually, great success in redeploying. One of our earlier questions about how are we going to redeploy these expense savings, and it really comes down to fine tuning these markets, particularly those markets where we don't have a significant market share at the time, but they're large markets that are growing. Houston is a perfect example. Tampa's a good example. Jacksonville is a good example, where we have a reasonable presence but not an enormous market share like we do in the Orleans our South Louisiana, Baton Rouge or the Gulf Coast. But those markets will have a small market share, it allows us to really redeploy the expense base that previously was attributable to the retail branch network that we inherited or acquired and redeploy that into a very specific, commercial-focused effort, which, obviously, we have been very successful in the past. And yet as you can see, in this quarter and we feel very comfortable with the pipeline being able to continue to generate that strong C&I growth.
Operator
Our next question comes from Emlen Harmon from Jefferies.
Emlen B. Harmon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
The core margin down 3 basis points quarter-over-quarter, below your kind of guided decline of 5 to 10 basis points. Can you give us a sense of just kind of maybe where that's -- with the underlying trends that are helping that out are -- and do you feel like if loan growth continues at this current pace and with the rise in rates, should you be in the lower end of that compression guidance over the next few quarters here?
Michael M. Achary
It's Mike. Related to the quarter, obviously, we were helped out by the change in earning asset mix to deployment of the excess liquidity that we effected toward the end of last quarter. We were also able to push our cost to funds down 3 basis points. And then finally, the loan growth, certainly was a big help. Although I will point out that the vast majority of that loan growth did occur really in the second half of the quarter, so we'll see a little bit fuller impact on the margin this quarter related to that quarter's late loan growth. And then certainly going forward, we believe that we'll be able to continue to show these kinds of levels of loan growth. So with that all said, the guidance that we gave last quarter around 5 to 10 basis points of being compression on a near term basis really still kind of holds true. We were down 3 basis points this quarter, and we still have, obviously, some downward pressure on our NIM. Once we get to the sustained levels of loan growth and have a fuller mix of loan growth, we think those pressures will lessen. That makes sense?
Emlen B. Harmon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
That does make sense. That's helpful. And then the excess cash recovery in the quarter, you guys have given us some pretty good guidance on when you expect some purchase accretion and kind '13, '14, '15. How much excess cash recovery is assumed in those estimates that you did laid out in the slide deck?
Michael M. Achary
Really none. And again, that speaks to the volatility of that particular line item and really how unpredictable it is. And so with that means, is to the extent that we can get a good deal with these excess cash recoveries, then those bars on Slide 12 will move to the left in terms of the accretion.
Carl J. Chaney
And also reflects our conservative approach to this. It is very difficult to forecast that so we just assume 0, but when you look at previous quarters and look at the amount that's come in, it's been significant at times. So but because there is absolutely no way to be able to forecast that, we take a conservative approach-type of forecasting and assume 0. We know that's not realistic, but there's no way to be any type of specificity around that forecasted amount.

Emlen B. Harmon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Got it. And then just last one for me, on the expense stage, you guys are obviously maintaining your efficiency plan guidance for by the time we get to 2014. But it's seems like some of those stage maybe a little slower and developing in '13. Could you just give us kind of the background there?
Michael M. Achary
Yes, I think as we said in the call a little bit earlier. We have a pretty defined pathway to get to the achievement of those goals. There really wasn't any expectation that we would show a lot of progress this past quarter. I think you'll see some progress in the coming quarter and certainly more by the time we get to the fourth quarter, again as we affect these branch closures. And then our guidance, and we're reemphasizing this, this morning, is that we'll hit those targets for the first quarter of '14.
Carl J. Chaney
Yes, the branch closures are expected to occur by August 30. So we feel very confident in our ability to just to hit our goals that we've laid out.
Operator
Our next question comes from Peyton Green from Sterne Agee.
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Carl, Mike, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the loan pipeline as to the volume and maybe how it compared them to year end and to a quarter ago. And then also, maybe what the mix look like. Have you seen any initial signs of mix change that might be more encouraging for broadening out of the mix?
Samuel B. Kendricks
This is Sam. We're very encouraged by the pipeline. We're seeing -- as opposed to some quarters where there might be a concentration relative to the components of growth, we're seeing a more broad-based opportunities there. So -- and we're obviously encouraged by the fact that throughout the enterprise, East to West, that we're seeing growth opportunities. So I would characterize this as more broad-based than concentrated. We have some opportunities in C&I and CRE. You will have noticed that over the last 6 to 8 quarters, we have continued to manage down our CRE concentrations but we have -- we think managed down and the categories that we wanted to manage down, and then we have some opportunity for growth so we think we would likely see some growth in some of the CRE categories, particularly in commitments that are already made on the books as those findings come online. So we think it's going to be pretty broad-based and we're pretty encouraged by the pipeline momentum we have.
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. And the volume lines, I mean, what kind of order magnitude?
Carl J. Chaney
I think what we saw this quarter, this past quarter is reasonable. We don't see any significant drop offs from those levels at all. When we look, Peyton, at the pipeline, it's pretty strong. And so as I mentioned -- as I responded to an earlier question, there really was nothing unusual that was driving the strong loan growth this quarter. We expect that to continue that trend.
Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
So if you got that kind of volume in the third quarter, Mike, I mean, what's the willingness to let earning assets actually grow dollar for dollar? Is it still -- there's -- I guess, maybe where would you like the securities portfolio to be in a perfect world? How much smaller from the current level?
Michael M. Achary
Well, in a perfect world, I mean, we're very comfortable with letting the level that bond portfolio continue to truck down and let that be the primary source for funding loan growth. So I think on a very short-term basis, I think what you'll see is probably more of the same in terms of balance sheet management. You could see not much of an increase in average earning assets. But again, hopefully, a pretty significant change in that mix, more loans plus bonds.

Peyton N. Green - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay, great. So then with regard to the branch closures and the process improvement that's going on, how much of the branches -- I mean, how much -- closing 40 branches, I mean, is it a pro rata move on occupancy? Or are these lower cost branches or higher cost? I mean what, in terms of going through the line items as we recognize these things? Is there any disproportionate weight to personnel versus occupancy versus other?
Michael M. Achary
No, not really. I mean, as far as the impact on our income statement related to closing the facilities, it will go a long way to helping us achieve that first set of goals. So without doing the math there, you can see that it has a significant impact. I wouldn't say that the branches that we're closing necessarily the ones at the higher cost, although that probably is in the case in some selected branches. It's more of what we talked about last quarter and that is desire to be efficient as possible in terms of delivering our product and services to customers and doing that in a manner that make sense for the company.
Operator
Our next question comes from Christopher Marinac from FIG Partners.
Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division
Mike and Carl, if we look at the disclosures on last several quarters on originated loans versus the acquired loans and kind of add those 2 together and compare with where you were 2 years ago, like just right after the closing on a merger. Looks like you're ahead maybe 6%, 7% from the time you close. Is that a fair way of kind of judging, if we step back and kind of look at integration of the 2 banks 2 years later? Is that something we should continue to expand as time passes?
Michael M. Achary
Well, again, when you look at those various columns, the acquired loan portfolio is going to go down simply because of maturities, loans moving off the balance sheet and other things that are going on. So I don't know that's a perfect way of looking at or judging the integration. I think the integration success really is better judged on the things that we're doing now to grow our balance sheet and grow our customer base. And again, with the loan growth that we achieved this quarter and the prospects of the future, I think that, certainly, the results are evident.
Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division
Okay. Very well, then I guess, just as a separate follow-up is if you were to find an acquisition, do the efficiency improvements that you're doing, do they impact the back office or that sort of any integration of an acquisition even if it's small sort of be separate from the efficiency movements beyond the branch sales?
Michael M. Achary
Yes. I think the things that we've done, the things that we will do as we go to the rest of this exercise put us in the position to be that much more efficient from a back office point of view. Such that if we are able to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities, those efficiencies will already be in place.
Carl J. Chaney
Yes. This is Carl. The efficiency initiatives, they certainly won't have any negative impact in our ability to be able to do future acquisitions and fold those in. In fact, it actually will allow us to be even more efficient in the assimilation and integration of any future acquisition.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson.
Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Just a question on the Texas branches you're selling. Just curious how many branches that leaves you within Texas. I know it's more of the commercial banking focus there, but just curious what that leaves you with in terms of a small retail presence, if any?

Michael M. Achary
Yes, we had a total of 16, Jennifer, in Texas. We have slated 8 of those 16 for closure, and of course, we're selling 7 of the 8.
Carl J. Chaney
And those were variable. The 7 that we're selling are very small retail focus branches that allows us to reposition the remaining [indiscernible] and even look at growth of additional facilities that are very much specifically focused on commercial opportunities as opposed to overall retail and what we compare to...
Michael M. Achary
Yes. But let me correct that number. We had a total of 14 in Houston, not 16.
Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And another question on the energy portfolio. Just curious as to what the size of that is now and what you feel like the potential is for growth there.
Samuel B. Kendricks
Jennifer, this is Sam. Our energy portfolio at the -- for second quarter is just over $1 billion. When we say energy, that's across several segments of the energy spectrum, not just reserved-based lending but it also includes support industries that are very important to that segment of the economy. And that includes industry and businesses throughout South Louisiana and into Texas as well. And I think that's on Slide 4 of the deck, as well as the presentation on that. In terms of potential, they are continuing potential opportunities there. The oil and gas industry continues to show some strength and so we, obviously, want to continue to participate in that important segment of the economy for this part of the country. But it is not a singular source of loan growth in our portfolio strategically. It is part of the balance that we will be seeking but we do see additional opportunities in this segment.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matthew Clark from Crédit Suisse.
Matthew T. Clark - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Just a couple of follow-ups. On the crosses [ph] could you guys quantify how much you extracted this quarter? I know it wasn't a lot but just curious with what the number was.
Michael M. Achary
No. We did not, Matt. We do not quantify that number.
Matthew T. Clark - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And then on M&A, I think in the past you guys have expressed interest in wanting a larger presence in Houston and, I think, Tampa to Jacksonville. Are you guys willing to consider opportunities outside of those markets on the M&A front?
Michael M. Achary
Well, if you look at the -- it's 5 states that we operate in. Those are very attractive markets for us. We will certainly look at opportunities within those 5 states. When you look at some of the markets in which we have a presence in there are some real opportunities for future growth and these markets that I'm referring to have great growth prospects economically. And so I think there's plenty of room in our existing footprint by state for us to have some significant growth opportunities through acquisition when the right deals present themselves.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matt Olney from Stephens.
Matt Olney - Stephens Inc., Research Division
Wanted to go back on the core net interest income kind of x at PAA that you highlighted on Slide 12. It was down sequentially again in the second quarter. But the level of decrease seems to be slowing down quite a bit; I think it was just down $700,000 this quarter. Is it fair to say that core NII could hit the inflection point in 3Q? Or could we be still be a few quarters from that inflection point?
Michael M. Achary
Yes, Matt, I would tell you that the inflection point is maybe a quarter or 2 away for the reasons we kind of talked about a little bit earlier. A lot of the loan growth we experienced this quarter again, was back-ended. And I allow the core of margin improvement but certainly related to our ability to deploy some of those excess liquidity that we had from early in the year. So the momentum related to continuing loan growth and then getting a fuller mix of loan growth will be the things that will really help us with our inflection.

Operator
That concludes the Q&A portion of our call. And I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Carl Chaney for closing remarks.
Carl J. Chaney
Okay. Thank you again for joining us. As you see, we're pleased at the very strong quarter that we were able to post in. I'm very confident about that next couple of quarters as far as what we see in our pipelines. So again, we thank you for participating today's this call.
