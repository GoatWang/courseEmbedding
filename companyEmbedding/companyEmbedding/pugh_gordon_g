Inspirational Speaker
Antarctica 2020
Ocean Advocate



“Wherever we damage the environment, conflict ensues. We have had enough conflict; now is the time for peace.”


“If you see injustice, do not wait for leaders. Stand up – alone if you have to. Your courage will inspire others.”


“If you want to swim across the English Channel from England to France – you have to leave your doubt on the beach in England.”


“If you choose the right team members, you don’t have to lead them. You only need to point them in the right direction.”


“The point about proper preparation: it changes ones sense of what is possible.”


“Impossible is NOT a fact. It’s an opinion.”


“The impossible is what nobody can do, until someone does it.”


“There will always be 100’s of reasons to quit. Think of just one reason to keep on going. It will make all the difference!”


“There is nothing more powerful than the made up mind.”


“The right to have our environment protected for the benefit of present and future generations is our most important human right.”


“If we pass on an unsustainable environment to our children we have failed them.”


“Everywhere water is under threat. It is our most precious resource. And there is no alternative to it.”
