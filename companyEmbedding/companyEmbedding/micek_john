This column is all about taking the time to look up.Sure, there's plenty enough down here on our little, blue and green rock to hold our attention.President Donald Trump made his first tour through Europe and the Middle East. A congressional candidate in Montana slugged a reporter. There was a horrific bombing in England that killed teens and children. And the model Kendall Jenner did something in Cannes that was apparently worth of our attention.
But news this week that "the weirdest star in the sky is acting up again," and that there's an outside chance (however tiny, however remote) that it might be the product of alien civilization is ample reason to pause and look up.In case you missed it (and who could blame you if you did?) scientists are eagerly tracking the activities of a star some 1,300 light years from Earth, in the constellation Cygnus, that strangely blinks in and out like a dying light bulb.Sometimes, as The Washington Post reports, its brightness dips by as much as 22 percent.And scientists have absolutely no idea why it's happening.The star, a yellow-white dwarf by the way, bears the boring scientific designation KIC 8462852.But I prefer its much homier and affectionate nickname, Tabby's Star, for the the Yale University astronomer Tabetha Boyajian, who first discovered it back in 2015.Tabby's Star did its dimming thing again last week, The Post and other outlets reported. And as much as astronomers go bananas, they went absolutely bonkers over this news. That's because the could observe the dimming as it happened.So they started crowd-sourcing observers, encouraging them to train their telescopes at the star and to take down what they saw.Among them is Jason Wright, a Penn State astronomer who's part of SETI (or the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) project.He has the coolest theory by far -- that it might be an alien megastructure, possibly a huge array of orbiting solar panels, maybe constructed by an alien civilization, that harvests the energy from a nearby star."Ancient alien civilizations could be arbitrarily advanced, and so it's not clear what physics we're allowed to assume," Wright wrote. "We don't know why they would create megastructures (though energy collection seems like a good guess to me) so we have no good reason to expect any particular shape or size for them.
"Imagine that it is advantageous to collect solar energy to be used for some purpose, and that there is enough material to do so, but not an infinite supply," he continued. "Imagine that the panels have a range of sizes and orbit the star in a range of orbital periods."But even if it's not aliens, the recent activity at Tabby's Star gave astronomers a rare opportunity.And whatever data they collect will go a long way toward explaining how and why it happens (comet activity is another hypothesis).No matter what scientists figure out, it's going to be pretty mind-blowing. And it will undoubtedly expand our knowledge of the cosmos.
But here's what I really love about stories like this: However briefly, we put aside all the stuff that divides us and turn our collective gaze upward, pausing from our arguments to collectively marvel at the enormity and magnificence of creation and our own, relatively minor place within it.I have this friend who lives in a tucked away corner of central Pennsylvania, where there's hardly any houses and no development for miles and miles. He has, by far, one of the best views of the heavens that I've ever seen.It stops me in my tracks every time.And on clear and depthless night, you can look up and see this blanket of stars blinking back at you. You can watch as the planets make their transit across the sky. And you can remember that they've done this for millennia and will continue to do so long after you and I and everything else is dust.The light that's reaching us now from Tabby's Star is a message from our own past.It took 1,300 years for those fluctuations in starlight to travel from Cygnus. And if it came from an alien source, they, too, might be long gone.And, whoever they were, maybe they paused to look up and gaze at their own starry sky, wondering if someone, somewhere might be gazing back at them and what they might be like and what they might be thinking.There's time enough for quarrels. Time enough for fighting. But those moments when you can pause and look up, and give thanks for all those slender and fragile threads that tie us together?Those are a blessing.

From 'I alone can fix it,' to 'I won't own it,' in just two moves: John L. Micek

A year ago this week, newly anointed his party's candidate for president, Donald J. Trump capped the Republican National Convention in Cleveland by ascending the podium in the Quicken Loans Arena, and offering these words:
"Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it."
A year later, as the latest iteration of an Obamacare repeal lay in smoking ruins, Trump said this:
"I think we're probably in that position where we'll let Obamacare fail. We're not going to own it. I'm not going to own it," he said Tuesday. "I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it. We'll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us."
But Trump, along with Congressional Republicans, does own the healthcare bill's failure for this simple reason: His party controls the White House and Capitol Hill.
Trump cut Democrats out of the process, and neither House Speaker Paul J. Ryan, R-Wisc., nor Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., made any meaningful attempt to include them in talks.
"This White House, like the last one, has outsourced healthcare to Congress," U.S. Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., told MSNBC last month. "That's what happened with this bill. Congress is largely writing this bill."
Lest you think Dent, who hails from the moderate 15th District in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, here's Tiana Lowe, writing in The National Review, which can hardly be confused for liberal:
"Rather than begin his tenure with legislation set to gain bipartisan, or at least Republican, approval, Trump dived into the most complex cornerstones of GOP dogma without a real plan or the discipline to sell it to the American people," Lowe wrote. "After publicly pressuring Paul Ryan to ram through a notoriously unpopular bill in the House, Trump slammed it as "mean." The Senate then had to rewrite major aspects of it -- while navigating even more difficult political terrain, because Republicans have a smaller majority in the upper chamber than they do in the House."
On Wednesday, as it became clear that McConnell faced consistent and steady opposition to repealing Obamacare without a replacement in hand, pundits faulted Trump for failing to do the hard work of selling the bill to voters.
"The fact is Donald Trump did a terrible job selling healthcare because he didn't really try to sell healthcare," Joe Scarborough, the former GOP congressman from Florida who hosts the daily "Morning Joe" gabfest on MSNBC, observed Wednesday.
In fact, Trump did the exact opposite of trying to sell the bill to the public - let alone to the Congressional Republicans with whom he allegedly works in common.
At various times, Trump threatened to primary Republican holdouts in the House. Then he said he hoped the Senate would come up with a better bill than the "mean" one passed by the House.
With that lack of message discipline, coupled with the fact that, despite seven years of big talk, Republicans failed to do much else than cobble together a set of unworkable talking points into legislation, it's no wonder the bill failed.
"Constantly distracted, never really focused. A lot of them complained that he didn't even understand what was inside the bill, so he really couldn't rally the base to support it. And you know, he can talk about 48 and 4, but the fact is he is 0 and 1," Scarborough observed.
Trump's greatest selling point in Cleveland - that he was a political outsider, a pragmatist and consummate deal-maker who could cure what ailed Washington has now become his greatest liability.
He has thus far demonstrated he is none of those things.

Six months into his presidency, Trump has vacillated between pushing healthcare and tax reform, ending up with neither. Away from Capitol Hill, questions about his campaign's ties to Vladimir Putin's Russia linger and seemingly get worse by the day. Pathological tweeting has distracted attention away from his legislative agenda.
In fact, here is little evidence that Trump has the knowledge or patience to spend the long hours it takes getting a piece of legislation from to get a bill from the conception stage to the finish line. Nor is there any evidence that he has surrounded himself with those who can.
Passing legislation is a pain-staking and deliberative process. Some members of Congress spend years working to get their bills onto the president's desk.
Sticktoitedness is part of the job description.
And for those who say, give Trump a chance, it is worth pointing out that, at similar points in their respective presidencies, Trump has signed fewer bills into his law than his predecessors. And those he has signed are remarkable for being mostly unremarkable.
Right now, Trump, the president, looks more like Trump the real estate developer, walking away from ruinous deals, abdicating responsibility, and leaving others holding the bag. 
That's a long way from "I alone can fix it."

t's time to own it, Republicans: You've had seven years to come up with a credible alternative to Obamacare. And when your clutch moment came, you choked.Again.The House's first crack at a repeal-and-replace bill was so bad that Speaker Paul Ryan had to yank it or risk a humiliating defeat. The second was slightly less awful, but still sufficiently offensive as to be declared dead-on-arrival in the Senate.
Now, after days of closed-door meetings where the very sharpest minds in Washington met to hammer out an alternative, we get a legless version of the mean-spirited Obamacare repeal bill the House passed.How bad is it? So bad that liberals and conservatives each found reasons not to like it.In a statement, the left-leaning advocacy group Families USA called the Senate bill "more harmful and equally heartless" than the House-passed bill. Meanwhile, four conservative Republicans announced they found it so unpalatable that they couldn't vote for it either.The Senate bill rolls back the Medicaid expansion that's extended coverage to millions of low-income Americans. It makes health insurance more expensive, offering inferior plans with higher deductibles, and spikes Obamacare's individual mandate. It hands a tax break to the wealthiest Americans, and, just for good measure, it eliminates federal funding for Planned Parenthood.The bill was so bad, in fact, that even President Donald Trump apparently felt like he needed to change the subject to something less politically radioactive: former FBI Director James Comey and the Russia scandal.On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that "Democrats would do much better as a party if they got together with Republicans on Healthcare,Tax Cuts,Security. Obstruction doesn't work!"By Thursday, any reference at all to healthcare evaporated, and Trump pulled a classic "Don't look here, look there," tweeting, among other things, that "I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings," of any meeting with Comey.Nonetheless, the White House, still in search of its first major legislative victory, says it's open to negotiation.
"The president is pleased to see the process moving forward swiftly in Congress, and he looks forward to seeing a finalized bill on his desk," White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said told The Washington Post."I don't think we're as focused on the timeline as we are on the final product."Which may be good news, because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has his work cut out for him.Thanks to some procedural arcana, McConnell needed 50 votes to send the bill back to the House. The Post reported Thursday that McConnell wants to do that before Congress' July 4 recess, regardless of whether he has the votes or not.
At this writing, it doesn't look like he does. And, as expected, there are zero Democratic votes.McConnell's fellow Kentuckyian, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul; Ted Cruz of Texas; Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mike Lee of Utah, have all said they can't vote for the bill in its current form."Currently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor. There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current health care system, but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs," the four lawmakers said in a joint statement.Yet Republicans continue to plug away, even as a growing number of Americans, finally realizing that they'll miss Obamcare if and and when it's gone, say they oppose the House-authored alternative.Forty-eight percent of respondents to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Thursday said the House-passed repeal bill was a bad idea. They were more narrowly split in their affection for Obamacare, saying 41-38 percent that it was a good idea.But Republicans, struggling to make good on a more than half-decade old pledge to dismantle Obama's signature piece of public policy, are plunging forward nonetheless.They might pass finally pass a repeal bill and maybe even send it to Trump. But it will be a terrible replacement.And it will be all theirs.
