Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Higher soybean plantings in the U.S. this spring boosted biotech seed giant Monsanto Co.' s quarterly profit, despite the broader slump in agricultural commodity prices. Farmers this year have dedicated more acres to soybeans after a string of record-breaking harvests have eroded the price of widely grown crops like corn and wheat.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Crop damage from a powerful herbicide is spreading across the southern U.S., spurring a flood of complaints to agricultural agencies and sowing division among farmers. Hundreds of farms in Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri and Mississippi have reported crops shriveled by dicamba. For farmers, lower crop yields due to herbicide damage could add to financial pressures after several years of low crop prices.

Missouri joined Arkansas on Friday in banning the use and sale of the weed killer dicamba after a rise in complaints that the agricultural chemical is drifting into neighboring fields and damaging crops, the states agriculture departments said on Friday. Dicamba use and complaints about its use have spiked in the past two years in the United States.

BASF will consider buying seed assets that rivals are putting on the block to win antitrust approval for tie-ups, saying bargain prices could persuade BASF to overcome its traditional reluctance to expand into the seeds industry.

Higher soybean plantings in the U.S. this spring boosted biotech seed giant Monsanto Co.' s quarterly profit, despite the broader slump in agricultural commodity prices. Farmers this year have dedicated more acres to soybeans after a string of record-breaking harvests have eroded the price of widely grown crops like corn and wheat. Soybean prices had fared better due to strong demand from China and elsewhere, though prices have declined as farmers ramped up planting.

Influence & Lobbying
The primary goal of much of the money that flows through U.S. politics is this: Influence. 
	    Corporations and industry groups, labor unions, single-issue organizations - together, they 
	    spend billions of dollars each year to gain access to decision-makers in government, all in 
	    an attempt to influence their thinking.

Use these resources in OpenSecrets.org's Influence & Lobbying section, which are also 
    found at the left, to learn more about Washington's influence industry and its most powerful players. 
Interest Groups
Just about any interest group you can think of has a presence in Washington-and spends 
    money to maintain that presence. Here we've totaled all the campaign contributions over the
	years from more than 100 interest groups, so that you can see patterns that might 
    have affected policies with an impact on your life. We also track how much interest groups 
    have been spending on lobbying, which is the other side of the influence coin.
Lobbying
Professional advocates make big bucks to lobby members of Congress and government 
    officials on the issues their clients care about. But the money that industries, companies, 
    unions and issue groups spend on lobbying is often just a drop in the bucket compared to 
    what they can reap in return if their lobbyists are successful. Here you can see who 
    spends what on federal lobbying and where they focus their resources. 
Revolving Door
You've heard it before - it's not what you know, it's who you know. In our nation's capital, 
    success comes with a combination of knowledge and personal connections. This database tracks 
    thousands of individuals who've spun through Washington's "revolving door", employing professional 
    relationships and know-how accumulated through public service to advance the goals of their private 
    employers.
PACs
In a campaign finance system where all the money originates from individuals, political action 
	committees, or PACs, control the most "corporate" of money. Controlled by companies, trade 
	associations, unions, issue groups and even politicians (a subset called "leadership PACs"), these 
	committees pool contributions from individuals and distribute them to candidates, political parties 
	and other PACs. PACs can also spend money independently on political activities, including advertising 
	and other efforts to support or oppose candidates in an election.
Organizations
Influence in Washington is created from many ingredients. Here we give you at-a-glance profiles of the 
	political donations, outside spending and lobbying expenditures of more than 20,000 labor unions, corporations 
	and trade groups, as well as the number of lawmakers who have personally invested in them. More detailed 
	profiles are available for the 150 or so biggest all-time contributors since 1989.
527s
For the longest time, campaign ads were almost exclusively produced by candidates and political 
    parties, but in recent years outside issue groups have been getting in on the action. They often 
    operate as so-called 527 committees (taking their name from the relevant section of the IRS tax 
    code). Sometimes mysteriously named, these advocacy groups frequently have ties to labor, 
    big business and super-wealthy individuals. Unlike political committees, they can accept 
    unlimited contributions from just about anyone, and they deploy that money in various ways to 
    influence elections. Keep an eye on these shadowy groups here.

Also, for ease of identification, the names used in this section are those of the organization connected
            with the PAC, rather than the official PAC name. For example, the "Coca-Cola Company Nonpartisan Committee for Good Government"
            is simply listed as "Coca-Cola Co."
