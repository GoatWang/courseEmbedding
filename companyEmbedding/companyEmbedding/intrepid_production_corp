ABOUT INTREPID
No matter what stage you are in— from startup to enterprise— Intrepid has a solution. Whether you're looking for end-to-end digital product services or augmenting your existing team, Intrepid has the capabilities to customize a solution that fits your needs. 
WORK WITH US
















WHO WE ARE
Intrepid is an end-to-end digital product strategy, design and development company founded in 2010, with offices in Cambridge, MA and Union Square, NYC.
With expertise in product strategy, design thinking, user-experience design/research, and impeccable development for iOS, Android, Back-end, Web, and embedded systems, we will help bring clarity to any omni-channel product vision.
With over 135 people across our two locations, Intrepid brings a diverse breadth of knowledge and insight to every solution we devise. Find out more about our team. 

















WHAT WE DO
Intrepid specializes in bringing digital products to market, especially those with a consumer end-user focus. We believe that creating successful products requires understanding both the business aims as well as the market context. Over the past seven years, we have developed and refined our processes to build the best digital products for our partners, while building lasting relationships. 
DIGITAL PRODUCT LIFECYCLE
The first step in working together is comprehending the digital product lifecycle and understanding where you are. 


 
CONCEPT
Every great product starts as a problem to be solved. At Intrepid, we have a dedicated team of Product Strategists who work closely with clients in early product development stages. We always begin with defining the problem to ensure concept ideation revolves around a smart and appropriate solution.








DESIGN SPRINTS
Design Sprints are typically two-week engagements that leverage a structured ideation process originally devised by Google Ventures. Design Sprints focus on a specific problem or idea, then iterate on the best possible ways to solve it. Our strategists work with your stakeholders to visualize and validate the ideas generated, so you can move forward confident in your product decisions. 



























DISCOVERY & DESIGN
At Intrepid, many of our engagements begin by defining a core problem and then articulating the solution with a bold and unique app concept. Our proprietary Discovery and Design engagement will take you from problem to prototype in six weeks. You’ll come away with the app concept, user stories, app flow, wireframes, visual design and an estimate for development— everything you need to tell the why, what, and how of your app to gather buy-in from key stakeholders and start to make it a reality.




























 
DESIGN
Once all requirements have been gathered, the next step is to create detailed designs. Intrepid’s team of designers is highly trained in both user experience and user interface design. We pride ourselves on creating applications that are not just highly functional, but beautiful.
Additionally, Intrepid offers services to help redesign existing products, as well as create new brands using our best-in-class Design Sprint processes. 








PRODUCT BRANDING SPRINTS
Our two-week branding sprint leverages our Design Sprint methodology, exploring the context of your company, your audience, and your criteria for success. We’ll generate several concepts to complement your identity. Those concepts are combined into deliverables which can then be used to enhance your future product.




























 
DEVELOP








Intrepid’s development expertise spans several functional areas. Our front-end mobile teams specialize in native iOS and Android development, while our web team excels in backend systems, front-end web development with Javascript frameworks, hybrid mobile development in React native, and systems integrations. We also have dedicated experts in IoT technologies, firmware, VR/AR technology, AI virtual assistants, and security.




























 
REFINE
Our delivery teams have Quality Assurance analysts at every stage of the process, because we believe quality is central to a successful product, and that a high-quality product is not optional. We set aside time for testing, polishing, and refining for every product developed in-house. 
Intrepid also offers code audits and ad-hoc design and development services for clients who approach us in later stages of their product lifecycle. 









 
MAINTAIN
Intrepid’s clients know they can count on our team, even after product launch. We have dedicated maintenance to ensure your products are secure and bug-free. We also recognize the importance of being technologically relevant; Intrepid can help you utilize the latest frameworks and platform advances so your product stays up-to-date. 
We also offer maintenance for products that Intrepid did not create, for clients who need that higher level of service.
