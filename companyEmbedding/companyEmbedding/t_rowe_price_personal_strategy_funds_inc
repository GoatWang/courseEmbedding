The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

				Personal Strategy Growth Fund

Investor Class
TRSGX

Invests in a diversified portfolio typically consisting of approximately 80% stocks, 16% bonds, money market securities, and cash reserves; and 4% alternative investments. The manager can rebalance the investment mix, within defined ranges, based on the economic outlook, interest rates, and financial markets. Effective October 1, 2016, Blackstone Partners Offshore Fund was added as an underlying investment of the T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Growth Fund.
Stock prices can fall because of weakness in the broad market, a particular industry, or specific holdings. The bonds in the fund are subject to interest rate, credit and liquidity risks.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

The bonds in the fund are subject to interest rate, credit and liquidity risks.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Personal Strategy Income Fund among 
400,
400,
348
and 
240
Allocation--30% to 50% Equity
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						

Combined Index Portfolio - Personal Strategy Income is a blended index portfolio 
consisting of 40% stocks (32%-28% Russell 3000 Index, 8%-12% MSCI All 
Country World ex-U.S. Index), 40% bonds (Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index), 
and 20% money market securities (Citigroup 3-Month Treasury Bill Index). 
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
	

^ T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a 
portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient 
to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments 
in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will 
vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other 
T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

How to Invest



Testing 123!
Shares of the Variable Insurance Portfolios are designed to be offered to insurance company separate accounts established for the purpose of funding variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. The annuity and life contract holders or participants are not the shareholders of the funds. Rather, the separate account of the insurance company is the shareholder. The variable annuity and variable life contracts are described in separate prospectuses issued by the insurance companies. The funds assume no responsibility for such prospectuses, or variable annuity or variable life contracts.
Shares of the funds are sold and redeemed without the imposition of any sales commissions or redemption charges. However, certain other charges may apply to annuity or life contracts. Those charges are disclosed in the insurance contract prospectus. Your ability to exchange from these funds into any other T. Rowe Price fund that serves as an investment option under your insurance contract is governed by the terms of that contract and the insurance contract prospectus, as well as the funds’ excessive and short-term trading policy described in this section.













Benefits & Risks
Common stock portion has the potential to grow faster than inflation over the long term to help protect purchasing power, while the income provided by the bond portion can help cushion changes in stock prices.Primary risk is declining share prices; the bond portion will be subject to interest rate and credit risk.



Investor Profile

For Investors seeking a middle-of-the-road approach that emphasizes stocks for potential capital appreciation but also produces significant income to temper volatility.
Appropriate for intermediate- to long-term investment goals.
The portfolio should be used as an investment option for variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts.

*Ratings displayed with hollow stars represent Morningstar Extended Performance Ratings.  Morningstar provides adjusted historical returns and an Extended Performance Rating for some mutual fund share class that don't have a 1, 3-, 5-, or 10-year performance history.  These hypothetical Morningstar Ratings are based on the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted for fees and expenses.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







In addition, through April 30, 2018, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. has agreed to pay the operating expenses of the fund’s I Class excluding management fees; interest; expenses related to borrowings, taxes and brokerage; nonrecurring, extraordinary expenses; and acquired fund fees and expenses (“I Class Operating Expenses”), to the extent the I Class Operating Expenses exceed 0.05% of the class’ average daily net assets.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

*The T. Rowe Price Funds-I share Class the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date.  Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, The I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.

U.S. government agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency and may include conventional pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Unlike Treasuries, government agency securities are not issued directly by the U.S. government and are generally unrated but may have credit support from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., FHLMC and FNMA issues) or a direct government guarantee (e.g., GNMA issues). Therefore, this category may include rated and unrated securities.







U.S. Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The ratings of U.S. Treasury securities are derived from the ratings on the U.S. government.

Investment Objective
The fund seeks the highest total return over time consistent with a primary emphasis on income and a secondary emphasis on capital growth.
Strategy
Invests in a diversified portfolio typically consisting of about 40% stocks, 55% bonds, money market securities, and cash reserves; and 5% alternative investments. The manager can rebalance the investment mix, within defined ranges, based on the economic outlook, interest rates, and financial markets. Effective October 1, 2016, Blackstone Partners Offshore Fund was added as an underlying investment of the T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Income Fund.







							Risk/Reward Potential**
						


						Click on the risk/reward spectrum below to view the funds in that category
					









Higher
Moderate
Lower






















The fund focuses primarily on income and, secondarily, on capital growth; it offers the lowest risk/reward ratio of the Personal Strategy Funds. The common stock portion of the portfolio has the potential to grow faster than inflation over the long term to help protect purchasing power, while the bond portion can help cushion changes in stock prices. The manager can rebalance the investment mix, within defined ranges, based on the economic outlook, interest rates, and financial markets. Investing equally in stocks and bonds, the fund carries the same risks as its counterparts, albeit to a lesser degree, while money-market securities help provide stability.

					**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.

Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis.  A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. 
If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. 
When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.


Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.

When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.

All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.  Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk.  Please consult the funds' prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds' risks.

		This compare function provides pertinent data to help you make your investment decisions. But there are other factors you will want to consider in your decision, such as the length of time you wish to maintain your investment and the amount of risk you are willing to take in pursuit of your goals.   This compare function allows you to compare funds based on performance history, risk statistics, etc.  Please be aware that funds within the same category may differ in investment strategy, portfolio holdings and risk level.  For this reason, you should not make your investment decision based solely on a comparison of funds' past performance.

			Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, yield, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. 
For up-to-date standardized total returns, please click here.

 
			The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of redemption fees, if it did, the performance would be lower.
		

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
		

^ T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a 
portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient 
to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments 
in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will 
vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other 
T. Rowe Price mutual funds.
			
			

 
			*Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. 
		

			Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
		

1 The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market fund than the total return.
		

2 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

		

3 The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing 
fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) 
and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date.  Because the 
I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I 
Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher.  

				The since inception performance returns are calculated from the investor class inception date indicated above.
				 
			

			    Morningstar rated the Personal Strategy Growth Fund among 
334,
334,
291
and 
210
Allocation--70% to 85% Equity 

funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable)
ending 06/30/2017, respectively. 

The Personal Strategy Growth Fund received 
5,
5 
and
4
stars for the 3, 5, and 10 year periods (as applicable) respectively.

					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation.

If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
