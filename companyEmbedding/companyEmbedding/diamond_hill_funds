Value

We believe market price and
intrinsic value are independent in the
short-term but tend to converge over time.









Long-Term

We maintain a long-term focus
both in investment analysis and
management of our business.









Discipline

We invest with discipline to
increase potential return and
protect capital.









Partnership

We align our interests with those
of our clients through significant
personal investment in our strategies.














Our Mission
At Diamond Hill, we serve our clients by providing investment strategies that deliver lasting value through a shared commitment to our intrinsic value-based investment philosophy, long-term perspective, disciplined approach and alignment with our clients’ interests.

Investment Philosophy

We believe competitive long-term returns can be achieved by identifying meaningful differences between market price and intrinsic value. We rely on our proprietary Investment Model to arrive at a first approximation of intrinsic value and then further refine our estimate through our independent research and experience.

About Us 





Home > About Us

Founded in 2000, we are an independent investment management firm headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. We provide investment management services to institutions and individuals through mutual funds, separate accounts, exchange traded funds, and private investment funds.
We place our fiduciary duty to our clients at the top of our corporate objectives, and we invest the capital you entrust to us with the same care that we invest our own capital. All of our portfolio managers are significant investors in the same portfolios in which our clients invest, and Diamond Hill employees and affiliates are collectively one of the largest investors in our strategies, ensuring that our interests are aligned with those of our clients.
We have not only grown assets under management in strong markets but have also retained a loyal client base through challenging economic periods. We are committed to achieving excellent long-term results and providing outstanding client service to existing and new clients.
Interview with Our Founder
VIDEO: Ric Dillon, CFA


Our Mission
At Diamond Hill, we serve our clients by providing investment strategies that deliver lasting value through a shared commitment to our intrinsic value-based investment philosophy, long-term perspective, disciplined approach and alignment with our clients’ interest.
Value
We believe market price and intrinsic value are independent in the short-term but tend to converge over time.
Long-Term
We maintain a long-term focus both in investment analysis and management of our business.
Discipline
We invest with discipline to increase potential return and protect capital.
Partnership
We align our interests with those of our clients through significant personal investment in our strategies.
Our Competitive Advantages

As an independent investment management firm, our primary goal and our culture center on achieving the best value-added investment results for our clients.
Our interests are firmly aligned with those of our clients through significant personal investment in our strategies and well-defined compensation practices.
In implementing our investment process, we are rigorous in:

applying our shared intrinsic value-based investment philosophy across all strategies;
adhering to a long-term investment temperament; and
insisting on a margin of safety in every investment we make.

Diamond Hill Large Cap Fund Class I


Symbol: DHLRX











































Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1091 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.





3 Yrs





                         Out of
1,091
 funds
                     	




5 Yrs





                         Out of
936
 funds
                       




10 Yrs





                         Out of
681
 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category







How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets in U.S. equity securities with large market capitalizations that the Adviser believes are undervalued. Large cap companies are defined as companies with market capitalizations at the time of purchase of $5 billion or greater, or in the range of those market capitalizations of companies included in the Russell 1000 Index at the time of purchase. The Adviser focuses on estimating a company's value independent of its current stock price.


Risk



Value stocks can perform differently than other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.



Short Term Redemption Fee
None



Who May Want To Invest

Someone who is seeking the potential for long-term share-price appreciation and, secondarily, dividend income.
Someone who is comfortable with the volatility of large-cap stocks and value-style investments.

Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The Russell 1000® Index is an unmanaged market capitalization-weighted index measuring the performance of the 1,000 largest companies in the Russell 3000® Index and is an appropriate index for broad-based large-cap funds.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 01/31/2005.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 06/29/2001, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 1/31/2005.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 6/29/2001, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
2. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
3. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
4. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
5. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
6. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 1/31/2005.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 6/29/2001, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
7. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
8. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, the issuer of a mutual fund is the fund or trust which issues the shares; the issuer of collective investment trusts is the underlying trust or investment vehicle which issues the units; the issuer of a stock fund is the company which issues the shares; the issuer of options such as separate accounts and strategies is the plan which makes them available; the issuer of a fixed return option is the insurance company or other company which offers the investment; the issuer of an annuity contract is the insurance company and/or the insurance company separate account.

Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Bitcoin surges as miners avert split for now
              
               Bitcoin continues to rise Saturday after miners back a software upgrade in a move that appears to avert a potential split of the digital currency into multiple versions.

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Sept. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Diamond Hill Capital Management, Inc., a subsidiary of Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:   DHIL), announced the launch of the Diamond Hill Short Duration Total Return Fund and the Diamond Hill Core Bond Fund. Managed by Henry Song, CFA and Mark Jackson, CFA, both strategies are also available as institutional separate accounts.  








"Henry and Mark have worked side-by-side for the last 10 years, applying a consistent, bottom up, intrinsic value-based investment philosophy and process to a style-pure core fixed income strategy. They will apply this same philosophy and process to the two new funds. Diamond Hill provides the right environment for them to successfully navigate the constantly changing fixed income markets as they seek to provide value-added returns for our clients," said Bill Zox, Chief Investment Officer – Fixed Income, Diamond Hill. 
Zox said, "The Short Duration Total Return Fund is a unique offering in the investment grade short-duration space that emphasizes structured products and targets a total return materially higher than the benchmark while seeking to maintain a higher average credit quality than a typical corporate focused, short duration strategy. This Fund is an option for those clients looking for additional yield in a low-rate environment."    
The Diamond Hill Short Duration Total Return Fund will primarily focus on investing in a diversified portfolio of investment grade fixed income securities and may invest a significant portion or all of its assets in asset-backed, mortgage-related, and mortgage-backed securities. The Fund will typically maintain an average portfolio duration of less than three.
The Diamond Hill Core Bond Fund will primarily focus on investing in a diversified portfolio of investment grade fixed income securities and may invest a significant portion in mortgage-related and mortgage-backed securities. The Fund will typically maintain an average portfolio duration within 10% of the duration of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index.
The Short Duration Total Return and Core Bond Funds are currently available through Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and SEI. We expect them to be available soon on additional intermediary platforms.
Chris Bingaman, CEO and Portfolio Manager, Diamond Hill, said "Henry and Mark have added a new dimension to our investment team and the extension of our fixed income strategies will allow us to better serve our clients."

Risk Disclosure: The value of fixed-income securities varies inversely with interest rates; that is, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed-income securities will decline. Lower quality debt (i.e.: "High Yield") securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the issuer's credit quality. The value of investments in mortgage-related and asset-backed securities will be influenced by the factors affecting the housing market and the assets underlying such securities. The securities may decline in value, face valuation difficulties, become more volatile and/or become illiquid. They are also subject to prepayment risk, which occurs when mortgage holders refinance or otherwise repay their loans sooner than expected, creating an early return of principal to holders of the loans.
The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 1-3 Year Government/Credit Index is an unmanaged index of investment grade government and corporate bonds with maturities of one to three years. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index is an unmanaged index representing U.S. investment grade fixed rate bond market, with index components for government and corporate securities, mortgage pass-through, and asset-backed securities. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Index is comprised of U.S. dollar denominated investment grade and below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Index tracks the performance of U.S. dollar denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market.

Diamond Hill Funds are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and have no bank guarantee.
Investment Grade is a Bond Quality Rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB. Security quality ratings are derived from underlying portfolio securities as rated by Standard & Poor's. For securities that are not rated by Standard & Poor's, but are rated by Moody's, the Moody's rating will be used. Diamond Hill does not calculate a rating for securities that are not rated by Standard & Poor's or Moody's. The Standard & Poor's and Moody's ratings represent an opinion only, not a recommendation to buy or sell. Unrated securities by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's will show in the "NR" or "Not Rated" category. CCC credit exposure includes the ratings CCC+, CCC, CCC- by Standard & Poor's; Caa1, Caa2, Caa3 by Moody's; and CCC by Fitch.
Duration measures the interest rate risk of the Fund. It is an estimate of the approximate percentage change in the Fund's net asset value resulting from a one percentage point change in yield.

(DHIL), announced the reduction of the management fee for the Diamond Hill Mid Cap Fund by five basis points to 60 basis points effective January 1, 2017. With a three-year track record as of December 31, 2016, the Mid Cap Fund also received its first star rating from Morningstar, earning four stars*. Diamond Hill Investment Group logoMore"Adding value for our clients is always our first priority, and we are mindful that our clients have alternative investment options, both passive and active," said Chris Bingaman, CEO and Portfolio Manager, Diamond Hill. "One of our primary goals is to achieve net of fee returns that exceed passive alternatives over time."Diamond Hill believes management fees should be reasonable and competitive. With this fee reduction, the Mid Cap Fund's total expense ratio for Class I shares (DHPIX) is in the lowest-cost quintile1. Diamond Hill Funds has also reduced its administration fees across its mutual fund family in nine of the past 12 years.   "After completing our value-add analysis, we believe this lower fee and the implied net outperformance goal will better align with our goal of top quartile peer group returns over rolling five-year periods," said Chris Welch, Mid Cap Fund Portfolio Manager and Co-Chief Investment Officer, Diamond Hill. For more information about our fee philosophy, please see our 2011 investment letter titled "Active Management Fees & Alignment of Interests" on our website, www.diamond-hill.com.   1 Source: Morningstar Direct as of January 5, 2017. Total Expense Ratio or "Prospectus Net Expense Ratio" is relative to all share classes in the Morningstar Mid Cap Value category.About Diamond Hill:We are an independent investment management firm with significant employee ownership and $19.4 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2016.

Diamond Hill Capital Management, Inc., a registered investment adviser, serves as Investment Adviser to the Diamond Hill Funds and is paid a fee for its services. Diamond Hill Funds are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and have no bank guarantee.*The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for the Mid Cap Fund is based on 337 mid-cap value funds as of 12/31/16. The Fund's Class I rating was 4 stars among 337 mid-cap value funds for the 3-year period ended 12/31/16.Read MoreTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/diamond-hill-announces-lower-fee-for-mid-cap-fund-300388054.htmlReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWho is Anthony Scaramucci?
