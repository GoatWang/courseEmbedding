Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Sungevity Appoints Peter Graf as Chief Product Officer; New Position Designed to Grow Leading E-Commerce Solar Brand, Taking Online Platform to Next Level
 


 

 




 





 


OAKLAND, Calif., April 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Sungevity, Inc., a recognized leader in the global solar market, today announced that it has appointed Peter Graf as Chief Product Officer, a new position for the company. As CPO, Graf will be responsible for leading the company's online platform strategy and execution. Specifically, he will lead product management, software development and IT, solar system design, as well as corporate marketing and communications. 
"Peter is very well-respected for his industry-leading experience in taking innovative software platforms to scale," said Andrew Birch, CEO, Sungevity. "I am excited to have him join our management team, and I look forward to him playing the central role in our plan to be the leading online platform company in the solar industry."
Before joining Sungevity, Graf served as the general manager of the sustainability business at SAP, a multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations. During his tenure he successfully built the sustainability vision of the company and drove its execution across SAP's worldwide organization – building a new growth business for the company from scratch. During his 20-year career in enterprise software, he served in a wide variety of senior leadership positions in strategy, marketing and development. Graf holds a Ph.D. in computer science.
Sungevity is well known in the solar industry for its leading software innovations, including the company's proprietary iQuote technology, introduced in 2008 as an easy and efficient solution to solar adoption. The iQuote process enables the use of satellite imagery and aerial photography to assess roofs remotely and accurately determine the feasibility of solar installations, eliminating time-consuming and capital-intensive home visits. In July of 2014, the company launched its Instant iQuote software that combines LIDAR, aerial photography and real estate parcel data to produce a 3D model of the property at a given address. It also can be used to rapidly assess the solar potential of entire cities, counties and countries for retailers, utilities and other partners.
"Sungevity was founded on the premise of using the Internet to make solar power an accessible and affordable source of energy for everyone," said Graf. "With only one-percent of U.S. homes equipped with a solar system today, more innovation is required to enable more people to go solar, and at lower costs. I passionately believe in this purpose, and am invigorated to help propel Sungevity's ability to deliver on it."  
For more information on Sungevity and its proprietary iQuote technology, visit www.sungevity.com. 
ABOUT SUNGEVITYSungevity is a global solar energy provider focused on making it easy and affordable for homeowners to benefit from solar power. Leveraging proprietary remote solar design technology, Sungevity can deliver a quote without a home visit and provide homeowners with visibility to potential savings on their electricity bills. The company continues to grow its global customer base and now services 12 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the Netherlands. Sungevity is also the residential solar partner to Lowe's, and was recognized in 2013 by B Corp as one of the "Best for the World" companies for overall social and environmental impact.
