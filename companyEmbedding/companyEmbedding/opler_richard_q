                                    Patents by Inventor Richard Q. Opler
                                




                    Richard Q. Opler has filed for patents to protect the following inventions. This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
                







Battery jumper cable clamp



Patent number:  5030106
                                            

Abstract:  A clamp for mounting a jumper cable to a terminal of a storage battery. The clamp comprises first and second movably mounted jaws having opposed gripping faces which define a gap for receiving the terminal. At least one of the gripping faces has an electrical conductor portion thereon for establishing electrical contact with the terminal. The first jaw has a gear rack mounted thereto, which is engaged by a pinion gear which is rotatably mounted to the second jaw. A worm wheel is mounted coaxially to the pinion gear, and is engaged by a drive worm. A handwheel is provided for manual rotation of the drive worm. The resulting movement of the first jaw relative to the second jaw adjusts the gap so that the battery terminal can be received and gripped therein. The clamp may have a bore which penetrates into the electrical conductor portion of the jaw for receiving an end of the jumper cable in electrical contact therewith, and a setscrew for securing the end of the jumper cable in the bore.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        February 8, 1990
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        July 9, 1991
                        

Inventors:

Patricia Ann Opler, 60 - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



Patricia Ann Opler, 60August 07, 2002Patricia Ann Opler, 60, a devotee of fly-fishing and a chef who taught others her passion for Northern Italian cuisine, died of a pulmonary artery embolism Tuesday, July 30, while returning to Chicago from South Africa. Born in Chicago, Mrs. Opler graduated from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale in 1964. She was married for 33 years to Edmond Opler, Jr., chairman and CEO of Chicago-based World's Finest Chocolate Inc. Trained in cooking at The Bakery in Chicago and restaurants in Milan, Italy, Mrs. Opler published a cookbook, "At Home on the Range," which also was the name of a cooking school she opened in Wilson, Wyo. One of her trademark recipes for gatherings of family and friends was game bird in red wine with Italian sausage, her husband said. In a 1985 Tribune article on a deli-style luncheon party where Mrs. Opler was the chef, she explained the advantages of cooking for a women-only event: "When men are present, you have to concentrate on having enough to eat," which means meat and potatoes, she said. Mrs. Opler split her time between Burr Ridge and Wyoming, where she once landed the largest trout in the annual Jackson Hole One Fly Fishing Contest. With her husband, Mrs. Opler was a founder of the Snake River Institute for art and education in Wilson. She also served as director of public relations and corporate communications for her husband's company. In addition to her husband, Mrs. Opler is survived by her mother, Olivia Tatro; a daughter, Julia T. Asbury; two sons, Clifford B. McGillivray and Edmond F. Opler; two stepchildren, Richard Q. Opler and Kim Opler; and nine grandchildren. Memorial services will be held Sunday in Jackson, Wyo.
