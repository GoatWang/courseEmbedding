Terms of Use
Please read these Terms of Use carefully before you access this website.  By accessing this website and any materials presented on it (the “Site”), you acknowledge and agree to be bound by all of the following terms and conditions pertaining to the Site.  If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, then you must not access the Site. 
 
HBK Investments L.P. and its affiliates ("HBK," "we," "us" or "our") reserve the right to limit or deny access to this Site to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction at any time without prior notice.  In addition, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Use at any time without providing any notice.  Any such changes shall be effective immediately.  By using this Site after we have posted changes to these Terms of Use, you are acknowledging such changes and are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Use as amended.  Your access and continued use of the Site is at your own initiative.  Accordingly, we suggest that you review these Terms of Use periodically for changes.  
 
Important Disclaimers
Interests in HBK’s funds may only be purchased pursuant to the applicable fund’s confidential memorandum, subscription agreement, organizational documents and audited financial statements (the "Fund Documents"). You must review the applicable Fund Documents in their entirety, including the risk factors, conflicts of interest and other cautionary disclosures contained therein, before making any investment decision. The Fund Documents supersede all other documents or disclosures in all respects, and you should rely only on the information contained in the Fund Documents.
 
In these various reports, and also in due diligence meetings, telephone conversations, email exchanges and other communications, we provide a range of information to investors and prospective investors.  In every case, such information is qualified by the Fund Documents.  In particular, all such information is qualified by all of the risk factors, conflicts of interest and other cautionary disclosures contained in the Fund Documents.  None of our reports or other communications is intended to, and no one has been authorized to, make any representation or statement regarding any HBK fund that is inconsistent with the applicable Fund Documents or that qualifies, limits or contradicts any of the risk factors, conflicts of interest or other cautionary disclosures contained in the Fund Documents.
 
The information on this Site is not intended to provide, and should not be relied upon for, accounting, legal, tax or investment advice or recommendations.  Investors must be willing and able to evaluate an investment in any HBK fund for themselves and to review and understand the applicable Fund Documents in their entirety.  HBK is not making any investment recommendation or giving any investment advice to any existing or prospective investor.  Investors must make their own decisions regarding any investment in any HBK fund, and each investor is responsible for engaging its own legal, tax, accounting, investment, and financial advisors and other consultants to whatever extent it deems necessary in connection therewith.
 
All of our investment programs involve substantial risk, and there can be no assurance that our investment, risk management or other objectives will be achieved.  Past performance is not an indication of future performance.  The investment objectives and strategies of the funds have varied over time and may, in the future, vary materially from those used in generating past results.  The funds are permitted to invest in an unlimited range of instruments and may pursue an unlimited range of investment strategies, including strategies not previously pursued or described to investors. Investment losses may occur, and investors could lose some or all of their investment. Our portfolio is not subject to any fixed limits on concentration by industry, company, geographic region, asset type, degree of leverage, liquidity, exposure to market risk, or otherwise.  We are not required to hedge any particular risk or type of risk, and our Funds may accept exposure to any risk or hold any position on an unhedged basis. Nothing herein is intended to imply that an investment in any HBK fund may be considered "conservative," "safe," or "risk-free.”  No regulatory authority has passed upon or endorsed this document or the merits of an investment in any HBK fund.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
