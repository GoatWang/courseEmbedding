What are analysts saying about DexCom stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about DexCom stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "In the past one year, DexCom has underperformed the broader industry in terms of price. Furthermore, a disappointing estimate revision trend indicates looming concerns ahead. DexCom reported narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter. We believe the company’s margins will continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters owing to high product development costs and rising expenditures on research & development. Specifically, the company is expected to have lower margins on transmitter sales (in spite of the cost reduction initiatives). Additionally, cutthroat competition in the market for blood glucose monitoring devices is a major headwind. On the positive side, the glucose monitoring market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom. The company has also signed collaborative agreements with several companies, which should not only bring in cash but also help expand its product portfolio." (7/18/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "DXCM reported 4Q sales $3mn ahead of its pre-announcement. Guidance for 2017 remained +25-30% ($710-740mn); importantly, this considers competitive entries by MDT (670G) and ABT (Libre), but does not factor in any contribution from DXCM patients covered by Medicare. With this low bar set for 2017, the next-gen G6 and the Verily Type 2 system coming in 2018, DXCM remains well positioned to succeed in an evolving diabetes landscape. The stock remains a top idea." (3/1/2017)
3. BTIG Research analysts commented, "Most Important; But The Report Was Not Clean; Buy As we previewed, revenue of $137.3M was in-line with our estimate and well above the street. We think this is most important. GMs disappointed and the $10M guidance raise was likely less than some hoped. With the stock having run from the $60s to the $90s, it is not surprising to see it pull back to the mid $80s afterhours. We would opportunistically buy shares on dips and would become aggressive around $80.   Top-line growth continues to beat expectations, thesis remains the same though in the $80s, upside has moderated. Having crushed both Q1 and Q2 sales expectations, we see DXCM as meeting our growth thesis. We believe some expected a raise beyond the new $550-$575M FY16 guidance. While this may pressure shares tomorrow we note during Q&A, mgmt did discuss how they would be pleased to come in above this when asked about $575-$600M. We model above guidance with $581M for Fy16." (8/4/2016)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 15 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.83)Consensus Price Target: $89.47 (34.56% upside)
