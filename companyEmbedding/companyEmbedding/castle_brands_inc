Castle Brands Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results
Jefferson's Bourbon named a "Hot Prospect" Brand by Impact Newsletter


NEW YORK, Aug. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Castle Brands Inc. (NYSE MKT: ROX), a developer and international marketer of premium and super-premium branded spirits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Operating highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2016:

Net sales increased 1.4% to $16.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, as compared to $16.5 million in the comparable prior-year period. 

Total gross profit increased 1.3% to $6.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, as compared to $6.6 million in the comparable prior-year period. 

Jefferson's was named a "Hot Prospect" brand by Impact, a prominent industry newsletter, based on accelerated sales growth in recent years and was ranked by IWSR as the number three selling super-premium American whiskey. 

U.S. Goslings Rum revenues increased 7.6% from the prior-year period. 

Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer revenues increased 27.6% from the comparable prior-year period. 
"While sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, typically our slowest period, were impacted by the timing of introductions of various line extensions and wholesale shipments, we anticipate accelerating sales growth over the balance of fiscal 2017. We are planning several additional releases for Jefferson's, including Ocean Cask Strength and other wine finishes, to build on the success of Jefferson's and Jefferson's Reserve. We expect sales of Goslings Black Seal to accelerate both in the U.S. and internationally and be augmented by the launch of Goslings Gold Seal, while we continue to see increasing sales of Goslings Stormy Ginger 
Beer," stated Richard J. Lampen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Castle Brands.  
"Based on the growing strength of depletions (sales from our wholesalers to retail outlets) during the quarter, we expect that accelerating sales growth will produce increased revenue, gross margin and EBITDA, as adjusted. Improved bottom line and substantial unused debt capacity position us to continue to add to our bourbon reserves to support Jefferson's as opportunities arise," Mr. Lampen added.    
"We are very pleased that Impact, a leading industry newsletter, has named Jefferson's a "Hot Prospect" brand based on accelerated sales growth in recent years. In addition, Goslings' sponsorship of the 35th America's Cup Challenge continues to expose Goslings Rum and the "Dark 'n Stormy"® cocktail on a global scale, and should provide for continued growth in the brand's core markets as well as the opportunity to expand to new markets. With the addition of new Goslings distributors in Canada and the Caribbean and launches in France, Sweden, 
Norway and Italy, we expect U.S. and international sales to increase over the balance of the year," said John Glover, Chief Operating Officer of Castle Brands. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company had net sales of $16.8 million, a 1.4% increase from net sales of $16.5 million in the comparable prior-year period. Net loss attributable to common shareholders was ($0.8) million, or ($0.00) per basic and diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, as compared to a loss of ($1.1) million, or ($0.01) per basic and diluted share, in the prior-year period. 
EBITDA, as adjusted, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $0.5 million as compared to $0.6 million for the comparable prior-year period. 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, adjusted for allowances for doubtful accounts and obsolete inventory, stock-based compensation expense, other (income) expense, net, income from equity investment in non-consolidated affiliate, foreign exchange (gain) loss and net income attributable to noncontrolling is a key metric the Company uses in evaluating its financial performance on a consistent basis across various periods. EBITDA, as adjusted, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Due to the significance of non-cash and non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables the Company's Board of Directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. The Company uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among 
others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and allocation of capital resources. The Company believes that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not indicative of its core operating performance or are based on management's estimates, such as allowance accounts, are due to changes in valuation, such as the effects of changes in foreign exchange or fair value of warrant liability, or do not involve a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income from operations, net income and cash flows from operating activities. A reconciliation of net loss attributable to common shareholders to EBITDA, as adjusted, is presented below.
