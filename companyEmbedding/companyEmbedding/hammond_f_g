		The Sound  The Hammond Organ Sound has been a basic building block for nearly every genre of music since its inception in 1935. Majestic, evocative, unmistakable, and timeless-only a true HAMMOND can provide it. Accept no substitutes.

Explore the Hammond Sound Library   
 The Soul  The Hammond Organ is soul personified. Those who play a Hammond share a fellowship that unites them. From the legendary Superstars to the most casual hobbyist, the Hammond Family is all-inclusive. Here are a few of our brightest Brothers and Sisters.
Browse the Hammond Artist Roster   
 The One  Only a genuine HAMMOND organ can provide the inspiration, confidence, and versatility for these modern musical times. There is a Hammond model for every player's need and desire; with the right size and weight, and at the right price. Beware of imitations; you can't clone soul, and you can't clone feel. Play the real thing.

Hammond News
We Get Fan Mail!! We get Fan Mail! It’s always nice to check the social media here at Hammond USA HQ and see happy posts from any of our nearly 300 Official HamFam Artists. We thought we’d share one from John W.F. Goode who writes: “Hi Scott – still getting rave comments on the sound of the XK5 at our June 24th festival show. The “sound” is indescribably wonderful, miles above anything including my trusty ol 58 C3! Love that XK5 — like a new top O the line Cadillac – simply glorious.” Thanks for those kind words, John! It’s that kind of energy which informs the Hammond Family-from the Pros like John to the folks who play for just the Love of it. Doesn’t matter if you’re playing a brand new Xk-5, an Sk-1 or a vintage B-3, if you’re playing a HAMMOND, […]

While you’re at the NAMM ORAL HISTORY site, check out some of the other entries; chances are your favorite artist has done one. #hamfam all the way! Follow This Link

Mark Stein’s Autobiography “You Keep Me Hangin’ On” The Legendary MARK STEIN of The VANILLA FUDGE has released his autobiography, and the Hammond Artist has tales to tell! It has been said by many The Vanilla Fudge is the seminal “Prog” band, and Mark’s incredible voice and incendiary Hammond playing was at the center of it.
