Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.


Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.



Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



          1. Fidelity's goal is to make financial expertise broadly accessible and effective in helping people live the lives they want. With assets under administration of $6.2 trillion, including managed assets of $2.2 trillion as of May 31, 2017, we focus on meeting the unique needs of a diverse set of customers: helping more than 26 million people invest their own life savings, nearly 23,000 businesses manage employee benefit programs, as well as providing nearly 12,500 advisory firms with technology solutions to invest their own clients' money.
	
    

          2. RMDs do not apply to investments in Roth IRAs or taxable accounts.
	
    

          3.
	
	
	       Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Fidelity reserves the right to change the funds available without transaction fees and reinstate the fees on any funds. Fidelity will charge a short term trading fee each time you sell or exchange shares of FundsNetwork No Transaction Fee (NTF) funds held less than 60 days (short-term trade).


          4. The Fund Evaluator is provided to help self-directed investors evaluate mutual funds based on their own needs and circumstances. The criteria entered is at the sole discretion of the user and any information obtained should not be considered an offer to buy or sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any securities. You acknowledge that your requests for information are unsolicited and shall neither constitute, nor be considered as investment advice by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC., Fidelity Distributors Corporation, or their affiliates (collectively, "Fidelity").
	
    

          Please note: When comparing funds, please consider all important factors, including information pertaining to fund fees, fund features, and fund objectives. While funds may track an index, the indices and strategies employed in seeking to achieve an investment goal may be different. Each fund’s investment object and strategy and index tracked to achieve investment goals may differ. For new investors, funding investment minimums may be different.

Fidelity® Contrafund®: Quarterly Fund Review

JUNE 30, 2017
View as PDF


Performance Review

For the second quarter, the fund's share classes gained about 6%, handily topping the 3.09% advance of the benchmark S&P 500® index. The investment environment this quarter generally supported the faster-growing, "best of breed" companies we prefer. Continued synchronized expansion in global activity provided a steady backdrop for equities, with flagging oil prices and muted inflation mitigating any concerns about potential overheating. For a second consecutive quarter, growth-oriented and large-cap stocks outpaced other U.S. equity categories. Most U.S. equity sectors posted a positive return this quarter. Several cyclical sectors outperformed – including industrials, financials, information technology and materials – but the best performer was the health care sector, a typically defensive group. Energy stocks continued to struggle amid declining crude oil prices, while price competition weighed on telecommunication services stocks.
Against this backdrop, the fund's outperformance of the benchmark was primarily driven by stock picks and a considerable overweighting in technology, where we had a sizable, long-term commitment that represented 42% of assets at quarter end. Notable contributors from tech included Google parent Alphabet, the fund's largest holding (combining its Class A and Class C shares). The stock gained about 10% the past three months, reaching a series of new highs after the internet search leader's April announcement of strong quarterly financial results that were driven by revenue from search ads, display ads and advertising on YouTube videos.
Also within tech, shares of gaming and entertainment company Activision Blizzard gained roughly 15% this quarter. Activision is best known for its video game franchises "Call of Duty," "World of Warcraft" and "Candy Crush Saga," among others. In early May, the firm announced that it topped its targets for quarterly sales and earnings, and also raised its financial forecast for the full year. Activision Blizzard specifically cited the success of its new franchise "Overwatch," reporting that it has more than 30 million users globally. It remained a sizable holding, reflecting our view that the company has improved monetization of its franchises. 
The fund's top individual contributor was a non-benchmark stake in Tesla, as the maker of electric cars saw its stock rise 30% the past three months. The soon-to-be-released mass-market Model 3 – with a starting price of $35,000 – enjoyed phenomenal attention and demand, with a reported 400,000-plus pre-orders, well beyond comparable models from BMW or Mercedes-Benz. Indeed, some investors worried whether the Model 3 electric vehicle was "too good," with potential to cannibalize sales from Tesla's more-expensive models. Also, Tesla's auto business continued to suffer production delays related to battery-production bottlenecks.
Elsewhere, online retailer Amazon.com was a notable contributor. While the firm is categorized as a retailer, it, too, is exactly the type of "tech" company we seek, and was a sizable holding. The stock gained 9% this quarter, rising steadily until cooling off beginning in early June as part of a broader sell-off among technology stocks.
Conversely, our largest detractor was TJX Companies. Shares of the owner/operator of discount chains T.J. Maxx and Marshalls returned about -8% this quarter. The stock began to fall in anticipation of the firm's mid-May quarterly earnings report – which disappointed overall, including comparable-store sales – and trended lower through June 30.
In industrials, the fund's non-benchmark stake in HD Supply Holdings returned about -25% this quarter. The construction and industrial equipment provider missed profits estimates for the first quarter and announced earnings guidance for the second quarter that fell considerably below some analysts' estimates, which hurt the stock price and prompted us to reduce our position.
Lastly, untimely ownership of fast-food retailer McDonald's hurt, as we decided to establish an underweighted position in April. Serving breakfast all day has been good for the firm, apparently, as this change, along with a focus on better ingredients and remodeling its restaurants, helped shares climb 19% the past three months. In the U.S., same-store sales rose 1.7%, beating analysts' estimates for the fiscal first quarter. ■

Outlook and Positioning

Most asset markets experienced unusually low volatility during the second quarter, even compared with the relatively calm levels of the past five years. The steady economic backdrop combined with ample global monetary accommodation supported a relatively tranquil environment.
The U.S. economy remains in mature expansion, but it has continued to exhibit some healthy flavors of mid-cycle growth on the back of the synchronized global expansion. Manufacturing activity has reaccelerated and become more broad-based over the past year, boosted by strengthening global demand and improved sales activity in the foreign sector.
Corporate earnings are still inflecting positively in 2017, as the continued global expansion supports manufacturing sectors and higher year-over-year oil prices drive renewed energy sector profitability. Firming inflation and global growth have given the U.S. Federal Reserve confidence to continue gradually hiking its short-term policy rate, although the environment remains weaker than during prior periods of Fed tightening.
In this environment, we plan to continue to focus on firms with improving growth prospects that seem overlooked by the market. We prefer faster growers, and the portfolio is positioned for an environment in which earnings growth is a prominent driver of stock performance.
Our exposure to tech was largely unchanged this quarter, and it remained by far the fund's largest sector allocation in both absolute and relative terms. We continue to believe many top companies here have the potential for significant growth. 
The fund emphasizes what we consider to be franchise companies in technology. These include Alphabet and Amazon, both mentioned earlier, along with consumer electronics maker Apple and social-media company Facebook, the latter of which was a top contributor the past three months. We believe these firms could continue to grow revenues from online advertising as consumers search the web more often from their smartphones.
If economic growth continues under a pro-business Trump administration, interest rates should continue to rise. Higher rates could increase profit margins for banks, which are likely to benefit further if Congress eases the regulatory environment. As a result, we have greater-than-index exposure to financials at quarter end.
We continued to avoid the utilities sector due to its persistent capital-intensive business models, regulatory pressure and historically slow growth. This positioning did not materially influence relative performance this quarter. At period end, our view was that utilities stocks traded at high price-to-earnings premiums relative to their history. Similarly, we largely avoided telecom companies, as they are capital-intensive, regulated and commodity-like. This stance modestly boosted relative results.
Energy remained among the fund's largest underweightings. We will continue to closely monitor developments here, looking for companies with improving fundamentals. Other notable quarter-end underweightings include consumer staples, health care, industrials and real estate.
The fund's exposure to international markets was minimal as of quarter end, as we prefer U.S.-centric companies, believing the U.S. economy should remain strong. ■

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. No Transaction Fee Fidelity funds are available without paying a trading fee to Fidelity or a sales load to the fund. However, the fund may charge a short-term trading or redemption fee to protect the interests of long-term shareholders of the fund. Shares are subject to the fund's management and operating expenses. See Expenses & Fees for more information.
2. The funds on the Fund Picks From Fidelity® list are selected based on certain selection criteria. Fund Picks From Fidelity is not a personalized recommendation or endorsement of any fund for an investor's individual circumstances.
3. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
4. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
5. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
6. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
7. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

This fee will not be deducted from fund positions opened after January 1 of that calendar year if those positions use regular investment plans.  Refer to the fund prospectus for details.
4. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. There is no minimum for additional investments in any type of Fidelity fund you already own.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
2. Daily return information, including YTD (Daily) returns are calculated by Fidelity, using NAV and distribution information provided by third party providers, including, but not limited to: Investment Managers, Morningstar LLC, Plan Fiduciaries, Third party Trustees, Issuers and other outside entities.  The daily returns calculated by Fidelity may vary slightly from the non-daily returns calculated by the third party providers for similar time periods.  The official returns offered by the third party providers shall constitute the final returns for the investment option.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later). Some products do not have monthly performance data available back to inception date. The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
6. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
7. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
8. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
9. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
10. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.

Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category.

Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
2. Daily return information, including YTD (Daily) returns are calculated by Fidelity, using NAV and distribution information provided by third party providers, including, but not limited to: Investment Managers, Morningstar LLC, Plan Fiduciaries, Third party Trustees, Issuers and other outside entities.  The daily returns calculated by Fidelity may vary slightly from the non-daily returns calculated by the third party providers for similar time periods.  The official returns offered by the third party providers shall constitute the final returns for the investment option.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later). Some products do not have monthly performance data available back to inception date. The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
6. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
7. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
8. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
9. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
10. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
