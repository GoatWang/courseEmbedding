Company Overview

Finore Mining Corp has completed the 100% acquisition of the LK (Lantinen Koillismaa) Advanced Stage Exploration Project in Finland from Nortec Minerals Corp. The acquisition is subject to a 2% NSR at production which can be reduced to 1% on payment of two million Euros. A recently completed NI 43-101 compliant technical report by MP Consultants Canada, outlined a significant 46 Million Tonne combined indicated and inferred resource containing Palladium-Platinum-Gold (PGE+Gold)Copper-Nickel grades.
A total of 33,486.4 metres of core resource drilling has been completed to date over 3 kilometers of strike length within the host Koillismaa ultramafic layered complex on the Kaukua and Haukiaho target areas. Greater than 40 kilometers of the exposed host Koillismaa formation are covered by 45 claim titles covering more than 3,750 hectares.
The Geological survey of Finland (GTK) outlined many anomalous areas with prospect drilling that need to be explored in the next round of proposed drilling. The next phase of exploration work on the LK Project is designed to drill areas with the potential to increase the average grade of Pd, Pt, Au, Ni, Cu resource and also increase the total resource of the area.

LK Project
Location: North central Finland
Target: Palladium-Platinum-Gold (PGE+Gold) -Copper-Nickel
Area: Area: 3,750 hectares (claims)
The LK Property is located in north central Finland, 660km north of the capital Helsinki, 65km south of the Arctic Circle. It is well serviced by power, roads and water allowing all season access and drilling. The Property consists of the Kaukua, Lipeävaara, Murtolampi and Haukiaho Zones. Prior to Finore’s acquisition of LK, Nortec Minerals carried out over 10,000 metres of diamond core drilling on the Kaukua Zone from 2007 - 2009 and over 7,000 metres of historical diamond drilling was performed on the Haukiaho Zone since the 1960's. In 2011 and 2012 Finore completed an additional 10,000 m of drilling around the Haukiaho and Kaukua Zones and 33,486.4 metres of core drilling has been completed in total. The Property has a combined surface area of over 3,750 hectares and covers a palladium-platinum–gold–copper-nickel ("PGE+Au-Cu-Ni") mineralized zone hosted within a sequence of mafic and ultramafic layered intrusions.
Finore now owns 100% of the LK Project in North Central Finland, subject to a 2% NSR on the Haukiaho claims and a 2% NSR on the Kaukua, Lipeavaara, Murtolampi claims. Both projects have a 1% buyout for €1M Euros.
Information to date shows that the Property has the potential to host PGE+Au-Cu-Ni deposits amenable to low cost open pit methods. The geology and the modes of to the West - Northwest.
Finore filed an independent Technical Report ("Technical Report") on Sedar on September 19, 2013, detailing the results on the updated resources on the LK Project. The Technical Report, entitled "A Technical Report on the Läntinen Koillismaa Project, Finland For Finore Mining Inc.", was prepared by Mining Plus Canada Consulting Ltd. ("MP Consulting"), an accredited international mining consulting corporation. The report complies with the NI 43-101 guidelines. This report has shown an indicated and interred resource of 46Mtonnes with Pd, Pt, Au, Ni, and Cu resources.
Finore Mining’s goal is to develop a quality, large tonnage PGE+Au-Cu-Ni resource that will underpin a long term mining operation. Based on higher-grade assays from recent drilling, Finore’s management is confident that further exploration will have a significant positive impact on the volume, and potentially the overall grade, of the current mineral resource.
