A Jetpack Company Is Coming Out With Flying Cars










































































 













































			Advanced Transport		
A Jetpack Company Is Coming Out With Flying Cars




													Google Play						
						
						
					









In Brief
As battery technology increases with the ever-growing use of electric cars, a flying vehicle will become more and more possibleWhile Jetpack Aviation is making huge leaps forward in flying car design and technology, they are not the only ones. There is actually competition in the flying car market 

Flying Cars on the Horizon
The guys who brought the world its first working jetpack are now looking to get into the flying car business. David Mayman of Jetpack Aviation (JPA) took some time to discuss his new concept designs with New Atlas.
The concept vehicle would be a manned multirotor vehicle with a dozen propellers arrayed coaxially. The vehicle would be capable of speeds up to 145 km/h (90 mph) and vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). One of the drawbacks of this technology at this point in development is how limited fly times are given the current state of battery capacity. However, as more traditional car companies go electric, the technology will catch up rapidly. According to Mayman, “…the beauty of distributed electric propulsion is that it’s very, very scalable. The way that electric motors work, it’s hey, you wanna make something for two people? OK, you just add power to the electric motors.”
 
Image credit: JPA                                                                
Closer Than You Think
The rapid pace of current technological innovation is actually making the first flying cars relatively easy to develop. Drone technology can be thanked for much of the advancement. “Drone technology has advanced all of that stuff – the autopilot, the stabilization – to the point where we nearly don’t have to do any R&D for that. We can just about start from off-the-shelf products and customize it for our use,” says Mayman.
There is actually plenty of competition in this burgeoning field. Some of the biggest names in both tech and aviation are throwing their concepts into the race. A Skype co-founder is investing millions in a super-fast flying car concept that reaches speeds up to 250 km/h (155 mph), a Google co-founder was even spotted coming out of a flying car in October of last year, and perhaps the most exciting prospect comes from Airbus’s plans to develop an autonomous flying car sometime this year.

Jetpack Aviation
A Real-World Jetpack.


Company Information

Website:
http://jetpackaviation.com/ 
Sector:
Other Transportation
Location:
Van Nuys, CA



JetPack Aviation is the first company to design and manufacture a jet-powered personal flight machine that can be easily carried by the pilot. 
This is the creation of a new market for individuals, corporations, and the military. Applications might include rapid organ transportation, high rise fire escape, and rescue missions behind enemy lines.
For over 100 years, writers, technologists, and futurists have promised the advent of personal flight with jetpacks. 
From its inception, this idea has captured the publicâs imagination. Now, Jetpack Aviation has finally created the technology solution to enable personal flight with its model JB10.
KEY FACTS
- Retail price of $250,000
- Up to 18,000 feet in altitude - 68 Miles per hour
- Over 10 minutes of flight time (varies with pilot weight)
- Built-in stabilization
- Uses ordinary jet or car diesel fuel
- Easy to use flight controls
Jetpack Aviation has conducted several demonstration flights for the U.S. military and has been awarded a CRADA (Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) by USSOCOM (U.S. Special Operations Command). 
This agreement gives the company access to the U.S. military's personnel, engineers, experts, and facilities. The CRADA agreement also opens up an opportunity to sell directly to U.S. armed services in the future.
It's worth taking a look at the demonstration videos of this device on StartEngine.

Here’s Your (Real) Jetpack.David Z. MorrisNov 12, 2015Even if all the hoverboards, self-driving cars, and hand-held communication gizmos haven't convinced you, there’s no more denying that we live in a mind-bending science fiction dreamland.The jetpack is here.The JB-9, which Van Nuys-based maker JetPack Aviation calls the “World’s Only True Jetpack,” had its coming-out party last week during a flight around the Statue of Liberty.There have, of course, been many other claimants to the jetpack name. But the JB-9 is “different to anything else being flown, or [that] has been flown historically,” says David Mayman, JetPack Aviation’s CEO and test pilot.The JB-9 is the product of ten years of collaboration between Mayman and Nelson Tyler, a process chronicled in a forthcoming documentary to be titled Own the Sky. Tyler is best known, appropriately enough, as an inventor for Hollywood, where his advanced camera tools have earned him three Oscars for technical achievement.Tyler was also the brains behind a so-called “rocket belt” developed in the 1970s. Inspired by the Bell rocket belt that appeared in the 1965 James Bond movie Thunderball, Tyler’s version had a long career in the movies and TV.Relatedbrainstorm techHow Technology Is Creating Major Upheaval in the Workplacebrainstorm techHow Technology Is Creating Major Upheaval in the WorkplaceBut, just like most other almost-jetpacks, the rocket belt had serious limitations. Flight times were under 30 seconds, which is why their main application has been in Hollywood. The JB-9 has flight times of ten minutes or more.Then there’s Yves Rossy and his Jetman Dubai team, who fly jet-powered wingsuits. But those deploy from a helicopter, while the JB-9 offers true vertical takeoff and landing. According to Mayman, he can almost land on a dime.Finally, the Martin Jetpack is perhaps the least convincing contender for the title—it’s neither a jet, nor a pack. “They called it a jetpack because it’s a sexy marketing term,” says Mayman, in his genial Aussie burr. “But it’s actually a gasoline powered piston engine that drives ducted fans.”It’s also the size of a large motorcycle, and impossible for a wearer to carry. “Effectively it’s a drone,” says Mayman, “and then they put a man inside it.”The only proper jetpack previously produced, at least by Mayman's standards, was the Bell Aerosystems and Williams International “Jet Belt” of the late 1960s. But it was extremely heavy, and barely got past the R&D phase.The JB-9, in contrast to the Martin, runs scaled-down versions of the same kind of jet engines that drive a 747 or F-16. Unlike the old Bell-Williams device, it’s light enough to be carried by a wearer on foot, and small enough to fit into the back seat of a car. The JB-9 also runs on a range of fuels, including diesel and kerosene. Mayman says most of the JB-9’s performance advantages are thanks to recent advances in jet engine technology.There is still that eternal question of the jetpack—how do you not burn your legs? “It’s really not hot,” insists Mayman. “I could fly in shorts.” That’s because the exhaust mixes with ambient air almost immediately.Another advantage of the 'pure' jetpack is its performance in high winds and turbulence. “We have no wings, so when we fly into 30 or 40 mile per hour winds, we hardly feel it.”All of that makes the JB-9, at the very least, the first jetpack with potential practical applications. Mayman is particularly keen to see it in the hands of emergency responders, who could travel several miles over rough terrain much more easily than in a helicopter. Mayman says he's fielded inquiries from Hollywood (no surprise), individual collectors, and marketers who are curious about setting up a jetpack race series (cross your fingers).There are caveats. Even if the design is ready for prime time, the JB-9 is a prototype, and production at any scale is still in the future. Mayman wouldn’t speculate on the units' eventual price.Mayman is also the only person who has ever flown the JB-9. His swing around the Statue of Liberty came after what he admits was a sometimes-rocky learning curve, including dozens of practice flights on a safety tether over two years. Quicker training would be essential to real-world adoption.Legally, Mayman says JB-9s could be sold tomorrow, under the Federal Aviation Administration’s Ultralight aircraft classification. But, acknowledging that this is a particularly risky form of flight, JetPack Aviation wants to carefully select and train prospective pilots. Even Mayman hasn't taken the machine to its altitude limits, since the planned parachute assembly isn't complete.For all the market demand for a true jet pack, Mayman says the JB-9 has always been mainly a passion project. He’s a dedicated pilot of planes and helicopters, but he says nothing compares with the jetpack experience.“Ah, it’s extraordinary," Mayman gushes. "It’s like riding a motorcycle in the sky. It’s so maneuverable, all you have to do is think—I want to go left. And really you don’t do anything, it just goes left.“It becomes part of your body.”For more about the futuristic present, watch this Hyperloop video: Subscribe to Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

JetPack Aviation: See the 'world's only true jetpack' fly

            The 'world's only true jetpack'   
			                        Tuesday, 10 Nov 2015 |  8:00  AM ET |  00:32 




  JetPack Aviation calls itself the maker of the world's only real jetpack — a jet turbine-powered backpack powerful enough to lift a person into the air, but small enough to fit into the trunk of the car. 
  As they say on their website: 
  "We believe a JetPack should be just that — a jet turbine powered backpack that is capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), is extremely light and small and can easily be carried around by the pilot. It should be powerful enough to lift the pilot quickly to thousands of feet above the ground but small enough to fit into the trunk of a car."

In contrast, most "jetpacks" are actually powered by rockets, streams of water, or other means — not jets.  
The company's JB-9 can fly more than 100 miles per hour, can soar above 10,000 feet, and can last 10 minutes, according to Popular Science. The founders of Jetpack Aviation have been working on their product for 40 years, according to the company's website.
