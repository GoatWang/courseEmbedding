PokerTek, Inc. Announces Appointment of Joseph J. Lahti, former President, CEO and Chairman of Shuffle Master, Inc., as Director






March 06, 2006 09:05 AM Eastern Standard Time



				MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 6, 2006--PokerTek, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTEK) today announced the appointment of Joseph J. Lahti to its Board of Directors effective March 2, 2006. Mr. Lahti has been appointed by the Board to serve on the Board's Audit and Compensation Committees.  "We are honored to welcome Joe Lahti to the PokerTek Board," stated Lou White, Chief Executive Officer of PokerTek. "Mr. Lahti's experience and leadership in helping Shuffle Master grow from a start-up company to an industry leader will be of considerable value to PokerTek. More importantly, Joe is a phenomenal business executive who, along with our other Board members, will keep PokerTek's management team accountable and focused on the execution of our strategic plan." 

 "After meeting with the team at PokerTek, I was very impressed with the PokerPro(TM) product, their business model and management team," noted Joe Lahti. "PokerTek is a young company with enormous potential. I am excited about the opportunity to join their Board and hope that my prior gaming experience and current business experiences will allow me to assist PokerTek in achieving their ambitious goals."  About Mr. Lahti  Mr. Lahti served as President, CEO and Chairman of Shuffle Master, Inc. (NASDAQ: SHFL), a gaming supply company for the casino industry, from December 1993 to February 2002. Since leaving Shuffle Master, Joe has remained active as both a shareholder and member of the Boards and executive committees of several companies in industries ranging from software, manufacturing, asset management (equities), real estate development and commercial furniture distribution. His educational credentials include a bachelor of science degree from Harvard University, with an emphasis in economics.  About PokerTek, Inc.  PokerTek, Inc. was formed to develop and market the PokerPro(TM) system, an electronic poker table designed to provide a fully-automated poker room environment, to tribal casinos, commercial casinos, and card clubs. The PokerPro(TM) system was developed to increase casino revenue by increasing hands per hour, while helping to reduce the labor costs within poker rooms. The PokerPro(TM) system is also designed to increase players' gaming experience by eliminating dealer and player mistakes, and eliminating the need for dealer tipping.  Statements made in this press release, other than those containing historical information, are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward looking statements herein include, but are not limited to, the expected adoption of the PokerPro(TM) tables by casinos and card clubs, the expected acceptance of the PokerPro(TM) system by players, the expected increase in profitability of poker rooms that install PokerPro(TM) tables, the expected receipt of regulatory approvals and the expected growth opportunities of PokerTek. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause PokerTek's actual results in future periods to differ materially from those set forth herein. These risks include: casinos and card clubs may not adopt and install the PokerPro(TM) tables at the rate currently expected by management, players may not recognize the benefits offered by the PokerPro(TM) tables and may not prefer the electronic tables over manual tables, and casinos and card clubs may not realize increased profits as a result of installation of the PokerPro(TM) tables. There are additional risks related to PokerTek's products and business identified in PokerTek's final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on October 14, 2005. Copies of PokerTek's filings with the SEC are available from the SEC or may be obtained upon request from PokerTek. PokerTek does not undertake any obligation to update the information contained herein, which speaks only as of this date.

The Company is in the business of developing, manufacturing,                   distributing and otherwise commercializing gaming equipment,                   games, and operating systems for gaming equipment and related                   products and services throughout the United States and in                   Canada and other countries (the "Business").            B.       Company and Employee want to create an at-will employment                   relationship that protects the Company and potential                   successors with appropriate confidentiality and non-compete                   covenants and rewards the Employee with appropriate                   consideration therefore, including a severance package, and                   incentivizes him to remain in the employment of the Company.            C.       The Company and employee desire that Employee be employed by                   the Company on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.                                       AGREEMENT            In consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, Employee and the Company agree as follows:            1. EMPLOYMENT.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
