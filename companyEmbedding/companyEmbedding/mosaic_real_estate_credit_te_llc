OAKLAND, Calif., April 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mosaic, the leading provider of affordable solar financing solutions for homeowners, today announced the closing of an up to $200 million warehouse facility with Germany's DZ BANK acting as administrative agent and lead lender. NY Green Bank is participating in the syndicate to further expand residential solar opportunities within New York State.  Guggenheim Securities, LLC acted as sole arranger of the facility. This agreement represents an evolution of Mosaic's business model to align with the industry's shift toward broad access to institutional capital providers. 








"Both DZ BANK and NY Green Bank have extensive experience as leading renewable energy financiers," said Billy Parish, founder and chief executive officer at Mosaic. "DZ BANK and NY Green Bank's committed, relationship-driven approach was a natural fit for Mosaic as we looked to build our largest warehouse credit facility to date.  With 40 percent consecutive monthly growth for over a year, we needed partners who could take us to the next level and help us grow as we continue to see the inevitable and rapid transition from fossil-fuel based electricity to rooftop generation of solar energy.  Guggenheim was instrumental in helping us to find the right lending partners to support our business plan.  The partnership with DZ BANK and NY Green Bank moves us towards our goal of having the ability to originate $1 billion in residential solar loans by the end of year to meet growing consumer demand for a simple, affordable, solar finance solution."
Mosaic's mission is to empower homeowners by providing the financial support needed to be able to fully benefit from owning their own solar system, saving tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the system. For solar installers, the Mosaic platform delivers the simplest and easiest financing experience in the industry. A fully integrated portal makes it possible for homeowners to get instantly prequalified, and seamlessly manage workflow from the initial meeting to installation day. More than sixteen thousand people have transacted with Mosaic to date.
"DZ BANK has been thoroughly impressed with Mosaic's operations, loan product and traction in the marketplace as they have gone from startup to leader in the market," said Frank Schehl, Managing Director and Head of Asset Securitization at DZ BANK.  "We identified this unique opportunity to leverage our experience in financing renewable energy solutions in the US. We are confident that between Mosaic's history of industry leadership and future aspirations, our partnership will continue to grow."

Honored by Fast Company as a Top Ten Most Innovative Company in Energy for two consecutive years, Mosaic is also a U.S. Department of Energy SunShot award recipient, a Sierra Club Trailblazer Company of the year, and was the Sustainability category winner of Verizon's Powerful Answers Award.

Fed Intervention: A View from Ethan Penner, Founder of Mosaic Real Estate Credit, LLC

October 24, 2016




By: Ethan Penner, Founder Mosaic Real Estate Credit, LLC
I read with great amusement that Janet Yellen feels that she must move to raise rates soon as she feared that failing to do so could undermine the credibility of the Fed (and of herself as well, I presume).  This amusement I felt is more the tragic-comic amusement rather than the joyful type.
First, the global economy remains weak.  China has just recently released statistics, which are very concerning about the health of their economy – which most point to as having been the engine of growth in the world for the past decade or more.  And, importantly, China is not known for honest admissions of its failings, so one might assume that things there may be even worse than these numbers imply.  The current “recovery” which one might characterize even graciously as having been a weak one, is long in the tooth and expected by most to be nearing its end.  Is this the time to raise rates, which traditionally has the effect of stifling economic vibrancy, one might rightly wonder?

Second, I wonder what credibility Ms. Yellen thinks that she or the Fed still have.  They have been wrong nearly 100% of the time when forecasting economic growth, and they’ve incorrectly telegraphed rate increases for years now.
It seems to me that Ms. Yellen ought to stop talking and stop wondering about Fed credibility.  She ought to stand down and let markets find ways to fund credit needs and let rates, which is the cost of credit, be determined naturally by the forces of supply and demand.  When rates rise, and asset prices fall, and the government deficit rises to both fund an increasing social safety net and higher cost of debt service she ought to do nothing except tell the government that it is not within her authority to bail them out of their fiscal stupidity.  This non-action would shift the focus to fiscal policy and impose the discipline that is needed and warranted upon government to right itself, and reveal to the public the gross incompetence of our current government – thus allowing more people to make informed decisions at the ballots.  Fed intervention has occurred out of a fear of the harsh disciplining nature of market forces, but the fantasy distortions that this has brought about has only allowed for the perpetuation of bad policies and bad decisions on every level.

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
