Alliance Data








































 













Making data actionable









Data — it’s what drives our business. We analyze millions of pieces of data and translate them into meaningful insights for our clients. That means bigger sales, stronger customer relationships, and sustained brand loyalty.










Doing good things that matter









We’re more than just our business results. We are equally committed to our associates, our communities, the environment, and the secure and responsible use of data. These responsibilities are not just important — they’re essential to who we are.










Using technology to save lives









Every second counts when lives are at stake. When a child is reported missing, or when there’s a severe weather warning, it is our brands’ technology that helps push millions of messages directly to people who need to know.










Strengthening our clients’ brands









With 300 million loyalty members worldwide, we like to think of ourselves as the ultimate matchmaker. We connect our clients’ brands with the right customer, at the right time, with the right message through the right device.








 







Who We Are






Harnessing the  power  of data to deliver business results 

You might not know our name, but you’ve seen what we do. Alliance Data is the engine behind loyalty and marketing campaigns for more than 1,000 consumer-facing companies worldwide across all industries: retail, travel, pharmaceutical, financial services, auto, and more.
In its own unique way, each of our three businesses better connects consumers with the brands they already love. And, we don’t do it through guesswork. We truly understand millions of individual consumers and their habits through our data analysis expertise. We understand where people like to shop, what device they like to use, the time of day they prefer to shop, what they’re shopping for, and the specific message that will interest them in a purchase.
That data-driven insight enables us to build dynamic and creative loyalty marketing programs and strengthen and deepen relationships between our clients and their customers. In today’s changing-by-the-minute digital landscape, that’s more crucial than ever.







Our Businesses







Card Services
Epsilon
LoyaltyOne







At Alliance Data’s card services business, we know 40 million consumers. How? They carry one (or more) of our clients’ branded credit cards, either in their wallet or on their mobile device. We manage more than 160 branded credit programs — private label, co-brand, and commercial — for the world’s most recognizable brands.
So, what does that mean exactly? When you use your Caesars Entertainment, Pottery Barn, J. Crew, or Victoria’s Secret credit card (just to name a few), that’s actually us. We capture transactional data, then use it to better understand consumer behavior and strengthen the ties between our clients and their customers. We also talk directly to consumers, providing outstanding and industry-leading customer care as part of the branded credit program. This combination translates to highly effective, multi-channel marketing communications for our clients. We also create incentives that drive sales, engage cardholders, and foster long-term brand loyalty.







Epsilon is a next generation marketing agency. We take a unique approach to managing the entire customer marketing lifecycle, as well as some of the world’s largest consumer databases for Fortune 1000 companies. By harnessing the power of rich data, world-leading technologies, creativity, and transformative ideas, our teams create multi-channel, tailored marketing solutions for our clients.
We play across every industry, from automotive and telecommunications to healthcare, travel, and entertainment. Our clients include nine of the top 10 banks, eight of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, and the largest automakers.
With the science fueled by our Conversant business, a global leader in cross-device matching technology and user-to-device accuracy, we’re able to connect our clients and brands to 263 million consumers across computers, smartphones, tablets, and connected TVs.
Technology + Creative = Epsilon, the #1-ranked U.S. agency across all disciplines by  Ad Age  five years in a row.







LoyaltyOne is an expert in creating coalition loyalty programs and stand-alone loyalty rewards. We built our expertise through one of the most successful coalition loyalty programs on the planet — Canada’s AIR MILES® Reward Program. We bring together your grocer, your pharmacy, your gas station, and other retailers under one coalition loyalty program, which allows consumers to earn points and rewards for their everyday purchases. With approximately two-thirds of Canadian households actively participating, the AIR MILES Reward Program has been named one of the most influential brands in Canada.
We’ve also helped grow Latin America’s largest and fastest growing coalition program, dotz.  Under our leadership, dotz has evolved into a full-scale retail coalition, partnering with some of Brazil’s top brands and more than 14 million collectors to date.
Finally, Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty transforms casual shoppers into loyal customers through tailor-made, stand-alone loyalty programs. These programs are designed to generate immediate changes in consumer behavior and are offered through leading grocers around the world.

Ed Heffernan  /  President & CEO, Alliance DataEd Heffernan has been responsible for growing Alliance Data into an S&P 500 and Fortune 500 company that has ranked in the top 1% of corporations in terms of shareholder return since he led its initial public offering in 2001. He joined Alliance Data in May 1998 as vice president of mergers and acquisitions, after holding similar positions with First Data and Citicorp, and in corporate finance with CS First Boston (now Credit Suisse). In 2000, he assumed the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Alliance Data. His promotion to President and CEO in 2009 occurred in the midst of the Great Recession, a period during which he not only guided the company through the economic storm but delivered growth despite the macroeconomic downturn. Ed is the architect of the Company’s unique business model, which, through its three businesses, offers a full suite of data-driven, targeted marketing solutions through three primary lines of business balanced to navigate through economic cycles, delivering consistent strong financial performance.
As he continues to grow the business, Ed is also committed to continuously raising the company’s corporate responsibility goals, with the belief that Alliance Data must deliver beyond financial performance to maintain its reputation as a responsible corporate citizen.

By Judy Dempsey, Strategic Europe, August 21, 2014
A three-page letter that was sent to German parliamentarians on August 18 makes sober reading.
Ostensibly, the letter is about how Europe’s sanctions against Russia and vice versa might affect the German economy. But the real message that Sigmar Gabriel, Social Democrat leader and minister for economic affairs and energy, Wolfgang Schäuble, federal minister of finance, and Christian Schmidt, food and agriculture minister, want to get across is that Germany’s special relationship with Russia is all but over… (more)

MOSCOW — On Thursday night a caravan of about 270 Russian military trucks, all freshly painted white, parked in a field outside the small town of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Ukrainian border. But long after dark, according to a report by a correspondent for The Guardian who happened on the scene, 23 Russian armored personnel carriers crossed through a gap in the barbed wire fence onto a dirt track in an area no longer guarded by Ukrainian troops… (More)

Questionable constitutional changes to gain and retain power, using armed thugs to suppress opposition and critical press, using hate speech against a minority group to divert attention from national problems, and now invading a neighboring sovereign nation to “protect” citizens who claim ethnic ties to his country from their own government – Vladimir Putin has often been compared to Adolf Hitler. 
With his current occupation of sovereign Ukraine territory in the Crimean and his likely expansion into the the rest of eastern Ukraine, Putin is inviting more comparisons. Will his own people begin to se him that way? Or will they continue to support him, or at least tolerate him, while he takes pages from the playbook of their most hated enemy of all time?
Is Putin this century’s Hitler?
Here are a couple of recent articles.

By The Baltic Times, Oct 19, 2013
Former Warsaw Pact countries are steadily adopting NATO standards despite fiscal and industrial constraints, reports news agency Stratfor…
…NATO standardization is important for both new and old members of NATO for two key reasons. Operationally, NATO forces benefit from having interchangeable infrastructure and a network of supplies and logistics, from small arms ammunition to lighting systems. Utilizing the same communication and procedural doctrine means NATO members can better operate together, whether calling in naval gunfire support or interrogating prisoners of war.
Strategically, NATO standardization enables member states to deploy together in missions such as Operation Odyssey Dawn (the intervention in Libya) while minimizing the challenges that usually accompany multilateral campaigns. This serves to bring the alliance closer through consistent combined service and training…(more)

Zapad-2009 military exercises. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
By Karlis Neretnieks (Ret MG, Swedish Army) , Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences, October 14, 2013
Russia´s military capabilities are rising fast. The exercise Zapad 2013 clearly shows that the Russian Armed Forces have left the deplorable state they were in some ten years ago, and that the lessons learned from the Georgia conflict in 2008 are being implemented. The new command structure with Strategic Commands and leaner tactical units is being tested. It is not yet perfect, but Zapad 2013 will give valuable lessons…
…Altogether we see a rapidly increasing Russian capability to mount large scale, complex, military operations in its neighbourhood, coordinated with operations in other areas. It would be a mistake to see this just a problem for the Baltic States. It should have implications for most of Russia´s neighbours, and also for other parties interested in the security and stability in the Baltic Sea region…(more)

By Alexander Shaparov, European Dialogue, October 14, 2013
The Arctic region is turning into an area of protracted geopolitical rivalry. This rivalry will not necessarily be expressed in any military confrontation, but rather will take the form of economic, technological and political competition. In this context, the states involved will be ever less prepared to opt for compromise in upholding their national interests within international organizations. NATO’s increasing activity in the Arctic will lead to transfiguration in relations in the area of international security, with new challenges and opportunities emerging for Russia.
The Arctic is becoming a new area of NATO’s influence, an area where security is closely associated with crucially important interests of its member states… (more)

By Andrzej Wilk, Centre for Eastern Studies (OSW), Sept. 25, 2013
On 20-26 September, the active (military) phase of the strategic-level exercises held by the armed forces of Russia and Belarus, entitled ‘West 2013’, were held. This was the largest joint exercise both armies had ever carried out; including the ranges in the western part of Belarus, Kaliningrad and the Baltic Sea, over 22,000 soldiers took part in it. For the Russian army, ‘West 2013’ did not constitute a particular challenge, coming as it did as part of the larger series of exercises arranged in parallel in the Murmansk oblast and the Barents Sea. For the Belarusian army, however, this year’s joint exercises are the biggest undertaking in military training it has carried out for two decades. Above all, ‘West 2013’ was a test of the integration of the Belarusian and Russian armies, and particularly of the former’s ability to act within the norms and structures of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.
The scenario and nature of the ‘West 2013’ exercises leave no doubt that the Russian/Belarusian forces are training to conduct regular military operations, and their potential opponent is the NATO countries bordering with Russia and Belarus. In political terms, however, we can observe a certain duality in Russia’s approach to NATO. On the one hand – thanks to the information about the exercises reported in media – we see that Moscow is aiming to provoke a negative reaction from its western neighbours. But on the other – from its joint non-military exercises (the ‘Vigilant Sky 2013’ anti-terrorist exercises held in parallel with ‘West 2013’) – it has tried to allay NATO’s concerns regarding the objectives of Russia’s military policy towards Europe… (more)

The European Union and Ukraine (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
By Adam Reichardt, The National Interest, Sept. 26, 2013
It is hard to believe that the election and events that set into motion Ukraine’s Orange Revolution took place nearly nine years ago. The scenes of young Ukrainians camping out on Kiev’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), demanding that their voice be heard and the will of the people not be ignored, was a moment which many believed was not only an awakening for Ukraine, but also a significant change in the whole of the former Soviet Union. One of the largest of the former Soviet states (excluding Russia) had finally begun to make its first strides towards Europe.
The energy and hope that arose out of the Orange Revolution was one of the main drivers behind a movement to bring a final end to the already tattered Iron Curtain. This initiative, which was launched in 2009 under the leadership of Sweden and Poland, became known as the Eastern Partnership (EaP). The goal was to create conditions that would enable greater political association and further economic integration between the European Union and the partnership countries. The belief then was that this project would speed up democratic, economic, institutional and civil-society reforms to bring these states closer to Europe. Membership in the Eastern Partnership was opened to the remaining “European” states that were once members of the Soviet Union—Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The 2008 war between Russia and Georgia further emphasized the need to create a stronger engagement with these countries, especially if they have aspirations to join the European community…
…The biggest Elephant in the East remains Ukraine, the largest of these countries. For both Europe and Russia, Ukraine is still considered to be the big prize. With a population of over forty-five million people (more than its western neighbor Poland) Ukraine’s potential as a consumer society is quite large. Opening up European markets to Ukraine and vice versa could be potentially a game-changer in the Eastern European region. A large section of Ukraine’s population is Russian-speaking, which can be advantageous to European companies who want to eventually do more business in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union… (more)
