Crowell Prize



Supporting academic research that furthers the field of quantitative management is a core tenet of PanAgora. Since 2001, we have sponsored the annual Crowell Prize, providing a forum for new and cutting-edge research that connects theory and practice. We believe this interaction contributes to the continued development of the science of economics and is a vital part of the development of optimal investment strategies. Each year, PanAgora solicits submissions from dissertation-stage graduate students and faculty at accredited academic institutions, as well as from practitioners working in the field.
PanAgora’s founder, the late Dr. Richard A. Crowell, was a pioneer in the field of quantitative investing. The concepts of asset allocation, risk management and portfolio selection models were in their infancy when Dr. Crowell began his career in the early 1960s. He was one of the first investment professionals to create an asset allocation model and one of the first to show how beta could be used to evaluate risk and control portfolios. Dr. Crowell earned a Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967, and in 1973 won the Graham and Dodd award for his paper, “Five Uses of Beta.”

Every secure page on PanAgora’s Web sites has been secured with a digital certificate by RSA Data Security, Inc. This is shown via the “site certificate” that sits on all secure pages. To view this certificate, click on the image of the “closed lock” on the bottom bar of your browser window. A small frame displaying site security information will appear. If you use Internet Explorer, click on the word “Subject” to verify the Web site. Click on “Issuer” to verify the site certification authority. If you use Netscape, click on the “View Certificate” button to see information on the subject and issuer.
User identification, where necessary
You can establish an on-line account on each of PanAgora’s secure sites by contacting your client service manager.
How to re-establish your identity with the site
If you have forgotten your password, or your password is not working for some reason, PanAgora helps you to re-establish your identity. Please call your client service manager for assistance.
Protection of stored information
All information collected on all PanAgora’s Web sites is moved off the Web site and stored on PanAgora’s internal computers. PanAgora takes many measures to protect your information while it is stored, including: Storing information on highly secure internal computer systems, and ensuring that information is not accessible via the Internet, using multiple levels of firewall protection to permit only required personnel to have access to stored information.
The PanAgora Web site only allows secure browsers access to the secure areas of our site. The browser’s “secure mode” is in place only when it is needed — when you are viewing or submitting personal financial information. You will be able to tell if you are in a secure mode when your browser displays a special icon on the screen. Specifically:

On Netscape Navigator 1.x, 2.x and 3.x, you will see a picture of a solid key
On Netscape Communicator or Navigator 4.x and MS Internet Explorer, you will see a picture of a closed lock
The Web site address will start with “https”, instead of “http”.

PanAgora’s Privacy Policy
In order to conduct business with our clients, we must obtain certain personal information such as account holders’ addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, and the names of their financial advisors. Using this information, we are able to maintain accurate records of transactions and account balances.
It is our policy to protect the confidentiality of our client information, whether or not PanAgora currently manages assets for a client. In particular, it is our policy not to sell information about you or your accounts to outside marketing firms. We have safeguards in place designed to prevent unauthorized access to our computer systems and procedures to protect personal information from unauthorized use.
Under certain circumstances, we do share information with our affiliates and outside vendors who provide services to us. In those cases, the firms with whom we do business enter into confidentiality agreements with us, and we limit the information we provide them to only what is necessary to process transaction and perform other services related to your account. We may also share information with our PanAgora affiliates to service your account or to provide you with information about other PanAgora products or services that may be of interest to you. It is also our policy to share account information with your financial advisor, if you’ve provided us with information about your advisor and that person is listed on your PanAgora account.
If you would like clarification about our confidentiality policies or have any question of concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us at 1-800-423-6041, Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

How to re-establish your identity with the site

Protection of stored information
All information collected on all PanAgora’s Web sites is moved off the Web site and stored on PanAgora’s internal computers.

The PanAgora Web site only allows secure browsers access to the secure areas of our site. The browser’s “secure mode” is in place only when it is needed — when you are viewing or submitting personal financial information.

On Netscape Navigator 1.x, 2.x and 3.x, you will see a picture of a solid key
On Netscape Communicator or Navigator 4.x and MS Internet Explorer, you will see a picture of a closed lock
The Web site address will start with “https”, instead of “http”.
