Alan Howard Said to Create Brevan Fund Managed Only by Him

                Fund to begin March 1, capped at $1 billion for outside money
            



                Brevan Howard’s assets down to $15.6 billion from $40 billion
            



Billionaire Alan Howard, co-founder of the $15.6 billion Brevan Howard Asset Management, is creating a new hedge fund that will be overseen solely by him, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The Brevan Howard AH Master Fund will manage a combination of new, outside capital as well as money from Brevan Howard’s flagship fund, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. The outside money will be capped at $1 billion, and the fund will begin trading March 1, said one of the people. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.The fund will cater to investors who want direct exposure to Howard, 53, as well as -- or instead of -- Brevan Howard’s Master Fund, which is overseen by 34 traders, in addition to Howard. He joins Moore Capital Management’s Louis Bacon in creating a vehicle that’s just run by a firm founder.




“It is sometimes difficult for investors to understand the source of risk and return in a fund managed by multiple portfolio managers," said Nicolas Roth, co-head of alternative assets at Geneva-based investment firm Reyl & Cie, which invests in hedge funds. “The new fund surely addresses this problem by having only one risk taker."

The move comes as Brevan Howard and other macro hedge funds are under pressure to boost returns in an environment of low interest rates, central bank interventions and high fees. The flagship fund suffered almost three years of losses before a reversal of fortune toward the end of 2016 led to a gain of 3 percent for the year. Even so, investors lost patience with the fund, withdrawing $7 billion and bringing assets to $11.9 billion at the end of December.Brevan Howard’s rough patch follows a decade of outperforming the market. The Master Fund gained more than 200 percent from its start in 2003 through the end of last year, beating the Eurekahedge macro index’s 173 percent advance. The hedge-fund firm has seen its overall assets shrink from $40 billion in 2013 to less than $16 billion at the end of December.The outflows from the Master Fund continued in January as the money pool started the new year with a loss of 1.5 percent. The fund’s assets declined by about $888 million to $11 billion during the month, according to an investor letter.Howard founded the firm in 2002 with four other traders from Credit Suisse Group AG’s proprietary fixed-income trading desk.

History[edit]
Brevan Howard was co-founded in 2002 by former Credit Suisse traders Alan Howard,[3] Jean-Philippe Blochet, Chris Rokos, James Vernon, and Trifon Natsis.[4][11][12] The company name was created by utilizing portions of the last names of the co-founders.[13] Blochet took a "sabbatical" in 2008, returned and left the firm again in November 2009.[14] Vernon left his position as chief executive officer (CEO) in 2011 but returned to the company as group chief operating officer (COO) in September 2013.[15][16] Another co-founder, Rokos, retired from the company in 2012.[15][17] The company received $2 billion to manage in the global macro fund from Credit Suisse Private Bank. Under the leadership of Brevan Howard's founding partner, assets grew to $10.5 billion in 2006.[18] The company generated a 25% return in 2007 and returns from their global macro fund continued to perform well during the financial crisis of 2008.[18]
In 2010, the company moved its headquarters from London to Geneva.[12] In July 2012, the firm opened an affiliate firm in New York called Brevan Howard U.S. Investment Management LP which had about $800 million in assets under management.[12] By 2013 the company had established Brevan Howard Capital Management LP on the island of Jersey.[19] As of June 2013 it was reported to be the largest European hedge fund management firm based on its total AUM.[5][19] An April 2013 article in the Financial News described the company as "the biggest and best-performing [hedge fund management] firm in Europe".[4] In 2015, The company reduced its workforce by about 10% due to reduced management assets and diminishing returns.[20] The fund had further losses in 2014 and 2015 and had only $14.5 billion in assets as of October 2016.[10] By 2016, the firm had reduced it's assets under management (AUM) from $41 billion spread across nine funds in 2013 to an $18 billion AUM spread over three funds.[10]
Investment funds history[edit]
In 2012, a founding partner, said the firm's overall strategy is focusing on "near-term opportunities" and establishing investment positions that are maintained for one to six months.[18]As a macro hedge fund, in 2013, the company aspires to profit as a result of "broad economic trends" and trades many types of assets including commodities and currencies.[19]
The firm set up 11 funds [21] including the Brevan Howard Master Fund (BHMF) 2003, Brevan Howard Multi-Strategy Master Fund Limited (BHMS) 2008, Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Strategies Master Fund Limited (BHEMS) 2007, Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Master Fund Limited (BHCC) 2009, the Brevan Howard Asia Master Fund Limited (BHA) 2004,[5] the Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Local Fixed Income Fund (BHEML),[22] Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Master Fund Limited ("BHCC"),[23] Brevan Howard Commodities Strategies Master Fund Limited ("BHCS"),[24] Brevan Howard Systematic Trading Master Fund Limited ("BHST"),[25] Brevan Howard Credit Value Master Fund Limited ("BHCV"),[26] Brevan Howard CMBS Master Fund Limited ("BHCMBS"),[27] Brevan Howard Investment Fund II - Macro FX Fund Limited ("BHMFX"),[28] The company also manages three closed-ended feeder funds, listed on the London Stock Exchange. They are: BH Global Limited (BHMG), BH Macro Limited (BHGG)[29] and Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Limited (BHCC).[30]
Its flagship fund, the Brevan Howard Master Fund Ltd. was capped at $25 billion AUM and closed to new investors in 2012.[18] It had a $28 billion AUM as of October 2013 and was reported to be the 11th most popular hedge fund among institutional investors in the U.S.[9] As of 2013, the Master Fund had averaged a 12 percent annual gain since its inception in 2003.[9][19][31] After 10 years the fund reported its first annual loss of 0.8% in 2014. [32][33]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Brevan Howard describes itself as a "global alternative asset manager" and maintains offices in London, Geneva, St. Helier, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Washington and New York.[34] The company employs more than 430 people worldwide with 28 employees in its New York office[9] and more than 40 employees at its offices located on the island of Jersey.[15][18][35] Eighty of its employees are traders[21] that receive commissions equal to "11% to 17% of gains."[4] This segment of the employee base includes 15 traders who work at the company's Ramat Gan, Israel office[36] with 38 traders being added to the "global team" of employees in 2012.[4] According to one of the company's founding partner's, "high turnover is part of the business model" and traders are "cut" if they do not perform up to the company's standards for success.[13][18] According to one investment consultant, "It's a very mercenary [corporate] culture.” [5] Brevan Howard's standards for success in trading are so high that some traders who have been dismissed from Brevan Howard "have become stars at other firms."[13] Geraldine Sundstrom, joined the company in 2007 and was the portfolio manager for the Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Strategies Master Fund Limited.[9][37] Sundstrom left the company in 2014 when the fund she managed was shut down.[38]
The company operated offices in Singapore from 2007 to 2014.[2]
Brevan Howard has made a variety of philanthropic contributions to the Imperial College Business School (ICBS). The company donated £20.1m over eight years to fund a financial economics research centre.[39] As of 2013 the firm had donated £1.5m to ICBS's, Alan Howard Scholarships for Energy Futures.[39] In 2012, BrevanHoward pledged a £250,000 donation to the ARK Bentworth PrimaryAcademy.[40]
British finance professionals consider the company to be their first choice for employment.[41] The company is noted for hiring ex-investment bank traders and highly qualified quantitative analysts.[42]

History[edit]
Brevan Howard was co-founded in 2002 by former Credit Suisse traders Alan Howard,[3] Jean-Philippe Blochet, Chris Rokos, James Vernon, and Trifon Natsis.[4][11][12] The company name was created by utilizing portions of the last names of the co-founders.[13] Blochet took a "sabbatical" in 2008, returned and left the firm again in November 2009.[14] Vernon left his position as chief executive officer (CEO) in 2011 but returned to the company as group chief operating officer (COO) in September 2013.[15][16] Another co-founder, Rokos, retired from the company in 2012.[15][17] The company received $2 billion to manage in the global macro fund from Credit Suisse Private Bank. Under the leadership of Brevan Howard's founding partner, assets grew to $10.5 billion in 2006.[18] The company generated a 25% return in 2007 and returns from their global macro fund continued to perform well during the financial crisis of 2008.[18]
In 2010, the company moved its headquarters from London to Geneva.[12] In July 2012, the firm opened an affiliate firm in New York called Brevan Howard U.S. Investment Management LP which had about $800 million in assets under management.[12] By 2013 the company had established Brevan Howard Capital Management LP on the island of Jersey.[19] As of June 2013 it was reported to be the largest European hedge fund management firm based on its total AUM.[5][19] An April 2013 article in the Financial News described the company as "the biggest and best-performing [hedge fund management] firm in Europe".[4] In 2015, The company reduced its workforce by about 10% due to reduced management assets and diminishing returns.[20] The fund had further losses in 2014 and 2015 and had only $14.5 billion in assets as of October 2016.[10] By 2016, the firm had reduced it's assets under management (AUM) from $41 billion spread across nine funds in 2013 to an $18 billion AUM spread over three funds.[10]
Investment funds history[edit]
In 2012, a founding partner, said the firm's overall strategy is focusing on "near-term opportunities" and establishing investment positions that are maintained for one to six months.[18]As a macro hedge fund, in 2013, the company aspires to profit as a result of "broad economic trends" and trades many types of assets including commodities and currencies.[19]
The firm set up 11 funds [21] including the Brevan Howard Master Fund (BHMF) 2003, Brevan Howard Multi-Strategy Master Fund Limited (BHMS) 2008, Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Strategies Master Fund Limited (BHEMS) 2007, Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Master Fund Limited (BHCC) 2009, the Brevan Howard Asia Master Fund Limited (BHA) 2004,[5] the Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Local Fixed Income Fund (BHEML),[22] Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Master Fund Limited ("BHCC"),[23] Brevan Howard Commodities Strategies Master Fund Limited ("BHCS"),[24] Brevan Howard Systematic Trading Master Fund Limited ("BHST"),[25] Brevan Howard Credit Value Master Fund Limited ("BHCV"),[26] Brevan Howard CMBS Master Fund Limited ("BHCMBS"),[27] Brevan Howard Investment Fund II - Macro FX Fund Limited ("BHMFX"),[28] The company also manages three closed-ended feeder funds, listed on the London Stock Exchange. They are: BH Global Limited (BHMG), BH Macro Limited (BHGG)[29] and Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Limited (BHCC).[30]
Its flagship fund, the Brevan Howard Master Fund Ltd. was capped at $25 billion AUM and closed to new investors in 2012.[18] It had a $28 billion AUM as of October 2013 and was reported to be the 11th most popular hedge fund among institutional investors in the U.S.[9] As of 2013, the Master Fund had averaged a 12 percent annual gain since its inception in 2003.[9][19][31] After 10 years the fund reported its first annual loss of 0.8% in 2014. [32][33]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Brevan Howard describes itself as a "global alternative asset manager" and maintains offices in London, Geneva, St. Helier, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Washington and New York.[34] The company employs more than 430 people worldwide with 28 employees in its New York office[9] and more than 40 employees at its offices located on the island of Jersey.[15][18][35] Eighty of its employees are traders[21] that receive commissions equal to "11% to 17% of gains."[4] This segment of the employee base includes 15 traders who work at the company's Ramat Gan, Israel office[36] with 38 traders being added to the "global team" of employees in 2012.[4] According to one of the company's founding partner's, "high turnover is part of the business model" and traders are "cut" if they do not perform up to the company's standards for success.[13][18] According to one investment consultant, "It's a very mercenary [corporate] culture.” [5] Brevan Howard's standards for success in trading are so high that some traders who have been dismissed from Brevan Howard "have become stars at other firms."[13] Geraldine Sundstrom, joined the company in 2007 and was the portfolio manager for the Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Strategies Master Fund Limited.[9][37] Sundstrom left the company in 2014 when the fund she managed was shut down.[38]
The company operated offices in Singapore from 2007 to 2014.[2]
Brevan Howard has made a variety of philanthropic contributions to the Imperial College Business School (ICBS). The company donated £20.1m over eight years to fund a financial economics research centre.[39] As of 2013 the firm had donated £1.5m to ICBS's, Alan Howard Scholarships for Energy Futures.[39] In 2012, BrevanHoward pledged a £250,000 donation to the ARK Bentworth PrimaryAcademy.[40]
British finance professionals consider the company to be their first choice for employment.[41] The company is noted for hiring ex-investment bank traders and highly qualified quantitative analysts.[42]
