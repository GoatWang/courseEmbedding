Career[edit]
Vines received his BS Degree in Chemistry from the University of Alabama and his MA Degree in National Security and Strategy from the Naval War College.
He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Infantry in 1971 through the ROTC program at the University of Alabama.
His previous assignments include the 3rd Infantry Division; U.S. Army Europe and Seventh U.S. Army; Ranger Department, US Army Infantry Center; Company Commander and S3 in the 1st Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment; and the original Executive Officer of the 3rd Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment at its activation from 1984 until 1987.
As Lieutenant General, Vines has served in several command and staff assignments within the XVIII Airborne Corps to include joint duty with the Joint Special Operations Command. He served as Commander, 4th Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, during its combat parachute assault in Operation Just Cause and later when the unit was deployed as the first ground combat unit in Operation Desert Shield.
His second tour of joint duty with the Joint Special Operations Command included operations in Somalia; Commander, 2d Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault); Assistant Division Commander for Operations, 82d Airborne Division; Chief of Staff, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg; Chief of Office of Military Cooperation, Cairo, Egypt; Commander, 82d Airborne Division from August 2000 until October 2002; Commander, Coalition Task Force 82, in Afghanistan from 1 September 2002 until 1 May 2003; and then Commander, Combined Joint Task Force 180, Bagram, Afghanistan, until October 2003; Commander, Multi-National Corps – Iraq in Baghdad from January 2005 until January 2006.
After retirement, Vines spent a few months on the board of USFalcon, an information technology and systems engineering firm specializing in defense. He had consulted for the Department of Defense, but does not now have any industry ties. "One of the reasons I chose not to do that is that I felt like I would be taking advantage of a revolving door," he said. "There is a lot of hypocrisy there."

Career[edit]
Vines received his BS Degree in Chemistry from the University of Alabama and his MA Degree in National Security and Strategy from the Naval War College.
He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Infantry in 1971 through the ROTC program at the University of Alabama.
His previous assignments include the 3rd Infantry Division; U.S. Army Europe and Seventh U.S. Army; Ranger Department, US Army Infantry Center; Company Commander and S3 in the 1st Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment; and the original Executive Officer of the 3rd Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment at its activation from 1984 until 1987.
As Lieutenant General, Vines has served in several command and staff assignments within the XVIII Airborne Corps to include joint duty with the Joint Special Operations Command. He served as Commander, 4th Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, during its combat parachute assault in Operation Just Cause and later when the unit was deployed as the first ground combat unit in Operation Desert Shield.
His second tour of joint duty with the Joint Special Operations Command included operations in Somalia; Commander, 2d Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault); Assistant Division Commander for Operations, 82d Airborne Division; Chief of Staff, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg; Chief of Office of Military Cooperation, Cairo, Egypt; Commander, 82d Airborne Division from August 2000 until October 2002; Commander, Coalition Task Force 82, in Afghanistan from 1 September 2002 until 1 May 2003; and then Commander, Combined Joint Task Force 180, Bagram, Afghanistan, until October 2003; Commander, Multi-National Corps – Iraq in Baghdad from January 2005 until January 2006.
After retirement, Vines spent a few months on the board of USFalcon, an information technology and systems engineering firm specializing in defense. He had consulted for the Department of Defense, but does not now have any industry ties. "One of the reasons I chose not to do that is that I felt like I would be taking advantage of a revolving door," he said. "There is a lot of hypocrisy there."

John R. Vines




John R. Vines Partner John R. Vines is a Partner and the Chief People Officer at McChrystal Group. He mentors client executives globally on leadership and strategy, as well as leads McChrystal Group’s human capital growth and development.
John retired from the United States Army in 2007, at the rank of Lieutenant General, after 35 years of active service. He was in continuous command for his last six years of service, including as Commander of the US Army’s XVIII Airborne Corps and of Multi-National Corps – Iraq during one of the most violent periods of the US presence in Iraq. In this latter position, he commanded a coalition force consisting of 178,000 soldiers from 27 nations, and oversaw two elections that ratified the Iraqi constitution and selected the permanent government.
Prior to his command of Multi-National Corps – Iraq, John commanded the Combined Joint Task Force 180 Afghanistan, where he commanded a task force of 10,000 US and coalition soldiers, deployed reconstruction teams, and worked closely with the President of Afghanistan. He also commanded the 18,000-strong 82nd Airborne Division. As well, John served as the Chief of the Office of Military Cooperation in Egypt, and served as the Senior Defense Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Following retirement, John was a Department of Defense senior mentor to military commanders prior to deployment to combat zones. At the time of his retirement, he was the oldest Soldier in the US Army on airborne jump status, and was considered a role model and a mentor for younger officers due to his numerous combat commands and hands-on leadership style. At his retirement ceremony, he was given the accolade, “For the next twenty years, the combat arms commanders will look, act and lead like John Vines."
