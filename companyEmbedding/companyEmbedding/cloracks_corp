We will not receive proceeds from the sale of the shares by selling 
shareholders.


We expect to face strong competition from well-established companies and small
independent companies that have established products with brand recognition and
greater financial resources than we have. We will be at a competitive
disadvantage in gaining brand recognition, employees, financing and other
resources required to provide product products demanded by prospective
customers. Our opportunity to obtain customers may be limited by our financial
resources and other assets. If we are unable to effectively compete with
other product providers our business will fail and you will lose your entire
investment.

We will not receive proceeds from the sale of the shares by selling 
shareholders.


We expect to face strong competition from well-established companies and small
independent companies that have established products with brand recognition and
greater financial resources than we have. We will be at a competitive
disadvantage in gaining brand recognition, employees, financing and other
resources required to provide product products demanded by prospective
customers. Our opportunity to obtain customers may be limited by our financial
resources and other assets. If we are unable to effectively compete with
other product providers our business will fail and you will lose your entire
investment.


Company Description
Cloracks Corporation is a Nevada corporation formed on November 1, 2012, to 
develop and distribute tray dishwasher racks for commercial applications. The 
tray dishwashing racks have, to date, not been marketed and have not produced

Our principal executive office is


 located at 3311 S. Rainbow Blvd., Suite 140,

Unfortunately, increasingly busy lifestyles make this a bit difficult at times, so it s important to create a nutritional safety net for yourself by consuming diet and nutritional supplements that can boost your health. The wide variety of diet and nutritional supplements can make it difficult to know what s right for you, so learning the basics of choosing nutritional supplements is the first step to getting the best supplements for your needs   along with talking to your doctor about what you might need to take. With the wide selection of diet and nutritional supplements available at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart, you can easily find all the vitamins and minerals that make it easier to lead a healthy lifestyle. Why should you use supplements? Nothing can replace a diet rich in minerals and vitamins, but when life gets busy and your stress levels rise, you may struggle to find the time to source and prepare nutritious dishes every day. By choosing nutrition supplements, you and your entire family can get the nutrition you need every day, no matter what life throws at you. Alternatively, if you're overweight and would like to lose weight, you may find it helpful to use dieting supplements such as appetite suppressants or fat inhibitors that can control your appetite and help you deal with the constant feeling of hunger. Vitamins and minerals Besides supporting general health, vitamins and mineral supplements may help head off chronic conditions, so it's important to make sure that your risk of dietary deficiencies is low by taking supplements. Before making your choice, ensure that you know what to look for in a multivitamin supplement.  Start by reading the label to identify the nutrients included as well as the amounts per serving.  If you're looking for a daily supplement that's suitable for most individuals, get a combination of basic vitamins and minerals. Some of the essential ingredients in such supplements include vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B6, A, folic acid, Vitamin E, iodine, zinc, magnesium, calcium and iron. Multiple types of multivitamins are targeted at helping individuals with specific conditions or nutritional needs. Women, for example, could take a supplement with folic acid when they're pregnant to help avoid some congenital disabilities. Middle-aged women can take calcium and vitamin D supplements to lower the risk of osteoporosis. Check the percentages to determine whether a certain supplement offers you 100 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for the vitamins and minerals included. You shouldn t take multivitamins that exceed the 100 percent recommended dose. Proteins and meal replacements Protein powders, protein bars and meal replacement supplements are a popular choice for those who engage in sports regularly. The human body needs large amounts of protein as part of a balanced diet, but just like in the case of vitamins and minerals, it may be difficult to get all the amount you need from food. protein shakes are available in multiple types, with the most common of them being protein concentrate, isolate and hydrolysate. Meal replacement shakes are often made with skim milk, and they're high in protein and fiber while being low in fat. They offer a high-energy meal, but they only have around 200 to 300 calories per serving. Protein bars are ideal for those moments you want a nutritious snack on the go. Diet supplements If losing weight is your goal, diet supplements can help you by curbing cravings and suppressing your appetite. Remember that these supplements aren't magic pills for losing weight and that they work well in combination with a nutritious, low-calorie diet and regular exercise. Chromium diet supplements are available in tablet form and they do a good job at reducing excess body fat while helping your body maintain normal sugar levels. Control your diet with an everyday weight loss kit that come complete with everything you need to embrace healthy eating, offering you a variety of breakfast options and snacks. Slimming powders combine appetite suppressants with protein and other nutrients to boost your metabolism. Diet-specific supplements are available at Walmart, so you can find options that are tailored to the specific phases of various diets.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863242, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more.
