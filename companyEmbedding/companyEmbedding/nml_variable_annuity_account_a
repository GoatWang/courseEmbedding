Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

                                            Your Retirement Big Picture: Where Do Annuities Fit?

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

What is a Select Variable Annuity?
When accumulating savings for your retirement, you know that saving in a tax-deferred account lets you save more over time and get the most benefit from the power of compounding. The Select Variable Annuity from Northwestern Mutual provides an additional way to save money for retirement and enjoy tax-deferred growth.1 You can start with a small balance and make additional payments over time or roll over funds from other retirement savings plans. Either way, the Select Variable Annuity offers investment choices that provide you the opportunity to engage a select team of investment professionals at Northwestern Mutual.
When you’re ready to retire, you can receive income through either withdrawals or as a lifetime income plan that you can’t outlive.
Is a Select Variable Annuity right for you?
This variable annuity may be right for you if you:

Have contributed the maximum allowed to your 401(k), 403(b), or IRA and would like the potential for additional tax-deferred growth with your savings or taxable investments.
Want to take advantage of the potential for tax-deferred growth for funds that don’t qualify for other retirement accounts.
Are looking for fee-free, tax-free transfers among a wide range of diverse, professionally managed investment funds including:
    
Fixed, bond, equity, international, emerging market and real estate funds
Hybrid and specialty funds
Active and passive (index) managed funds
Value, growth and blended styles
Small-, mid- and large-cap equities


Want the option to simplify your fund selection by choosing a prepackaged solution for an asset allocation model that matches your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
Are interested in automatic portfolio rebalancing to maintain your desired asset allocation and ensure that your investment best meets your overall financial objectives.

Our exclusive fee options save you money.
The Select Variable Annuity offers you two purchase options for maximum flexibility and cost savings:

With the front-load design, you pay the sales charge up front, but your annual expense charges will be lower and you’ll have access to your funds with no withdrawal charges.1
The back-load design lets you put 100 percent of your money to work for you right away, but it is subject to withdrawal charges and higher costs initially.
Northwestern Mutual is one of the few companies that provide a unique conversion feature. When you purchase the back-load plan, we’ll convert you to front-load pricing once we have covered our expenses — sometimes in as little as a few years, depending on the value of your annuity.2 This conversion feature helps you reduce your mortality and expense costs and may enhance the long-term value of your annuity.

Are you prepared to make your retirement dreams come true?
With longer life expectancies, fewer pension plans, doubts about Social Security, and market volatility, it’s harder than ever to feel secure about your retirement income. That’s why many people are turning to annuities.
An annuity is a contract with an insurance company that can help you put away money for retirement on a tax-deferred basis and provide an income stream during retirement that is guaranteed2 to last as long as you do. You can decide when that income stream starts—now or in the future—and you have options that will provide for your loved ones after your death.
There are many types of annuities to choose from, depending on your goals, time frame, risk tolerance and family situation. Find out more by clicking on the links below:

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

Earn Uncorrelated Returns of up to 5% In Shorter Term Maturities
Fixed annuity payment streams offer the opportunity for “yield alpha.” Because the periodic payments from annuities are unrated cashflows, they can be purchased at a discount. However, these same payment streams are backed by insurance companies rated A or better by A.M. Best Company.
Combined, these two features enable our clients to realize above average, risk adjusted returns of up to 5% annually.
Fixed annuities fund a variety of obligations including lotteries, personal injury settlements and investments. These secondary market annuities enable investors to capitalize on cashflows from a variety of diversified sources.
Structured Settlement Benefits

Higher Yields. Opportunities in structured settlements offer significantly higher yields than comparable fixed rate products.
Uncorrelated. Because structured settlement cashflows are long term insurance company obligations, they are generally considered to be uncorrelated to the economy at large.
Proven. Historically, defaults on annuity payments have been a fraction of the defaults typically associated with commercial loans.
Safer. Structured settlement cashflows are backed by insurance companies rated A or better. Even insurance companies that have merged, acquired or ceased operations are backed by runoff insurance which pays outstanding obligations such as payment streams.
Regulated. Insurance companies are subject to extensive regulation which includes federal oversight in addition to state-by-state insurance commissions.
Steady. Buyers of structured settlement payment streams receive regular, monthly payments following their initial investment.




"I became a Woodbridge Wealth client soon after I retired. I wanted an additional income stream and was willing to put some of my capital to work to accomplish that, if I could find the right fit. The Woodbridge team was patient, transparent, and honest with me. They directed me to the product that delivered what I needed in precisely the manner in which I needed it." – Sheldon Goldman

IN THIS REPORT:

Understanding the 3 types of annuities peddled by insurance salesmen
The 4 income traps (“retirement death traps”) hidden in the fine print
A little-known way to collect 14 payouts a year with the “Super 7 Annuity”


Hi, I’m Dr. Mark Skousen.
A word of caution: If you’re thinking of investing in an insurance annuity for its “guaranteed income”…
I urge you to think twice.
You see, annuities are often sold as one thing, but in reality turn out to be quite another thing altogether.
And you could end up making substantially less money than you counted on.
In my new report, I share the truth about annuities… the straight facts you’ll never hear from your annuity salesman.
So here’s what I suggest: Access your free copy of Annuity “Death Traps” by telling us where to send it in the box above or below.
Read it, and decide for yourself if annuities are right for you and your family.
Kind regards

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
