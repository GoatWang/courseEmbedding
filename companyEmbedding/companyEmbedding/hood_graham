Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,

Composite Score:





                        The Range Hood Store has received 4.34 out of 5 stars based on 4 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

 This Recovery Road Participants’ Guide is designed for use in conjunction with the Recovery Road Workbook. It is a very personal book that maintains a record of your own journey of recovery. The work book is packed with useful lessons and supporting quotes from acclaimed, inspirational authors.Recovery Road is a Christ-centred, 12-step, life-recovery program for all of life’s  hurts, habits and hang-ups. It is unique. Its approach to small group recovery unashamedly acknowledges Jesus Christ as the higher power. The program is structured around the eight principles of the Beatitudes as they came straight fromthe heart of Jesus in His famous Sermon on the Mount.Recovery Road does not just focus on one issue or addiction like other 12-step programs. It is a practical tool for recovery from many of life’s regrettable situations.There is now a hope for the future and we no longer need to remain stuck in our habitual behaviours that tie us down and hold us back.Graham and Michelle Hood have been involved in life recovery since 2007 and are highly sought after national and international guest speakers and presenters. Their own amazing testimonies speak cogently of successful recovery.Mission Serenity is a special, not-for-profit group dedicated to Restoring Broken Lives. Recovery Road is a powerful tool that has changed broken lives filled with despair into futures vibrant with hope and purpose.May God bless you on your very own Recovery Road journey.Graham and Michelle Hood,Mission Serenity cofounders.
