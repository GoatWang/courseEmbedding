Farmer Bros. Co. Announces Guenter W. Berger And Hamideh Assadi Will Not Seek Re-election To The Board Of Directors






GlobeNewswire



Apr 24, 2017 4:00 PM EDT













 


















































 NORTHLAKE, Texas, April 24, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farmer Bros. Co. (NASDAQ:FARM) (the "Company" or "Farmer Bros.") today announced that Guenter W. Berger and Hamideh Assadi have informed the Company that they will not seek re-election to the Board of Directors at the end of their current terms in December 2017, ending, for each, decades of distinguished service to the Company. After having immigrated to the United States in 1956, Mr. Berger was called to serve in the U.S. Army, and after two years of service, he accepted a job with the Company's Brewmatic division in Los Angeles. From there he was promoted several times and worked his way up to the position of General Manager, then to Vice President of Production at Brewmatic, as well as a Director of Farmer Bros.  In 1985 Mr. Roy F. Farmer requested that Mr. Berger relocate to the Company's corporate office in Torrance in order to manage all production and distribution.  Mr. Berger's loyalty and dedication to the business, as well as his steadfast belief in its core values, culminated in his appointment to President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors in 2005.  Following his retirement in 2007, Mr. Berger continued as Chairman and as a member of Farmer Bros.' Board of Directors, and his vast knowledge of the Company provided important vision and guidance as the Company expanded into specialty coffee and grew its geographic reach, ensuring that the Company was well-prepared for continued success for the Company's next era.  Mr. Berger served as Chairman of the Board from 2007 to 2015 and served as Chairman Emeritus since December 2015 and is currently a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. "I immigrated to the United States of America in pursuit of a better life, and it became the honor of a lifetime to work for Farmer Bros.," said Mr. Berger.  "After a 57 year career with Farmer Bros. and with the support of my family, exceptional employees, and, especially, the unwavering support from Mr. Roy F. Farmer, I can proudly say that I fulfilled my American Dream. It has been my honor to work for this company. Thank you and all the best in the future for Farmer Bros."
