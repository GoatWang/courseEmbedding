(WSM) Wappinger Capital Research Media, tech, dividend growth investing, small-capWappingerCapitalSummaryBottom-fishing is a dangerous stock picking strategy but Williams-Sonoma, Inc. now has fundamentals hard to ignore.The company seems relatively undervalued compared to its industry average financial ratios.Williams-Sonoma, Inc. has the potential to be both a value stock and a growth stock, as the projected EPS growth for next 3-5 years is 14.00%.By Stavros Georgiadis, CFA Bottom-fishing is a very dangerous investing strategy, but at the same time, it can be a very profitable stock-picking strategy if the conditions for perfect timing are met. A stock which has solid fundamentals, attractive growth prospects and a nice dividend yield plus is trading at very low financial ratios compared to the average ratios of its industry and has underperformed the general stock market in the first semester of the year is very hard to ignore. Williams-Sonoma Inc. (NYSE:WSM) stock has all the mentioned characteristics, and on Friday 21st July 2017 its closing price of $45.16 was only 2.73% above its 52-week low price of $43.96. While there are no guarantees that the stock cannot move lower, the arguments in our analysis favor strongly the scenario of an upside potential, and at current price levels, the stock is a very low-risk buying opportunity. The company is one of the largest United States e-commerce retailers, with a range of well-known brands in home furnishings, such as Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma, West Elm, Mark and Graham, Rejuvenation, having a global presence and a corporate strategy focused on e-commerce and online shopping. The company focuses on continuous internet offerings on its products, with incentives and discounts, and can benefit from its online presence as global e-commerce is estimated to reach 1 trillion U.S. dollar by 2020, having a rapid growth. One very important factor that can also help the sales of Williams-Sonoma Inc. is the weak U.S. Dollar, which makes the prices of its products cheaper on an international basis. This can have a positive impact on the number of future revenues for the company. The company offers worldwide shipping and it is forecast that about 900 million worldwide consumers or about 45% of online shoppers will purchase products online by the year of 2020. These numbers show the potential growth of online shopping, and Williams Sonoma Inc. follows a marketing and business strategy that takes well into consideration the global e-commerce growth in the future years and can benefit from it.
 The stock has a series of positive EPS surprises for the past 8 quarters, with 5 positive surprises, 2 flat or zero surprises, and only 1 negative surprise. The stock for a 5-year period of fundamental analysis from 1st January of 2013 to 1st January of 2017 has a consistent increase in its EPS (both basic and diluted) for all five years, and the same trend applies as well to its dividend policy. The company has increased its dividend on an annual basis for all the past 5 years of reference. While the increase of basic EPS for 2016 was only 0.87%, to $3.45 compared to the basic EPS of $3.42 for the twelve month trailing period of January 2017 to January 2016, the 5-year average EPS growth for the month of January 2017 is 8.96%. The company is expected to have a 3-5 years EPS growth of 14.00%. This shows a potential for higher future growth, which can have a positive impact on the profitability and the stock price. The analysts are optimistic about the future economic outlook of the stock, as out of 7 analysts, 5 have a hold recommendation 1 has an outperform recommendation, 1 has a buy recommendation and none has any underperform or sell recommendation. 

 

 Source The company has a very strong balance sheet, with zero debt, good liquidity with a current ratio of 1.42 for 2017, and a mixed efficiency in management as the receivables and the inventory turnover has declined in the 5-year period of analysis from 2013-2017, but the fixed assets and the asset turnover have increased. Maybe the efficiency is the weakest sector or economic performance for the company, as the cash conversion cycle has also increased during this 5-year period, meaning the company takes more time to convert inventories to cash.
 The valuation for the stock shows that it is relatively undervalued compared to the average financial ratios of price/earnings, price/sales, price/book value, and price/cash flow.        Price Ratios Company Industry   Current P/E 13.21 44.44   Price/Sales 0.79 2.61   Price/Book Value 3.23 9.14   Price Cash Flow 7.27 22.68   Source: MSN Money Another positive factor in favor of the valuation of the Williams-Sonoma Inc. stock is the positive and rising trend in its free cash flow, as in 2017 there was an increase of about 7.0% compared the free cash flow reading in 2016. The stock offers an attractive current dividend yield of 3.45%, which can add to the future holding period return for the investors who will decide to buy the stock at current low price levels. As a conclusion our investment thesis suggests that the stock is relatively undervalued, and having underperformed the general stock market strong performance of the first semester of the year, from a contrarian point of view, the stock looks also to have increased odds of closing its underperformance gap compared to the 1-year performance of major U.S. indices such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones. The stock has a 1-year performance at the closing date of Friday 21st July 2017 of -15.60%, while the Dow Jones is up +16.20%, and S&P 500 is up +13.68% for the same period. This underperformance gap is a very significant one to ignore, but the stock has a current beta of 0.79, and is less volatile than the general stock market. This makes the stock suitable for a defensive portfolio, as the major U.S indices are now near their all-time high prices, as the stock should present less volatility in the event of any severe selloff in the stock market. The current macroeconomic conditions with a weak U.S. Dollar is an additional fundamental factor which can help the sales growth of the company in a global environment. The company and its stock can be considered both a value and a moderate growth stock pick. The fundamentals of the stock make the bottom-fishing strategy, in this case, a low-risk investing strategy.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1947, Charles E. (Chuck) Williams settled in Sonoma, California, and opened his first shop as a hardware store. In 1953, Williams took his first trip to France. He quickly fell in love with French kitchenware such as copper cookware, and is quoted as saying, "I knew this was something that wasn’t found in America, but thought people would want."[11] Shortly after returning home, he formulated a plan to import French cooking and serving equipment into America and converted his store into a cookware shop in 1956.[12] Williams-Sonoma was founded, selling professional and restaurant-quality kitchenware for home use, leading to founder Chuck Williams being recognized as one of the titans of the American food revolution.[13]
In 1958, at the suggestion of customers,[14] Williams relocated the store to San Francisco. The store quickly became a destination with culinary figures such as Julia Child and James Beard becoming customers of the flagship location.[12] In 1972, along with—and at the suggestion of—regular customer Jackie Mallorca, Williams began publishing a mail order catalog to expand his business beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.[14] At the suggestion of customer and friend Edward Marcus, of Dallas-based Neiman Marcus, Williams decided to expand the company and formed the corporation, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in 1972.[15]
The second Williams-Sonoma store opened on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills in 1973.[16] The same year, Williams-Sonoma introduced the Cuisinart food processor to the American market through its stores and catalog.[17] Williams decided to sell his share of the company in 1978 to W. Howard Lester, an Oklahoma entrepreneur,[18] and businessman James McMahan. Williams maintained an ownership interest and guided the selection of merchandise and the production of the catalog. Lester took an active role as president and chief executive, while McMahan was the company director.[19] At the time, Williams-Sonoma had revenues of $4 million.[20]
1980 to 2000[edit]
Williams-Sonoma, Inc. had its initial public offering in July 1983. One million shares were offered on the OTC Market $23 a share.[21] At end of 1985, the company was generating over $51 million in sales.[21] In September 1986, Williams-Sonoma acquired Pottery Barn from Gap. The acquisition included Pottery Barn's 27 housewares stores located in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York for $6 million.[22] The company's expansion led to the opening of its first distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee in 1984. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is one of the largest proprietary distributors in the Memphis area with 3.5 million square feet of distribution space.[23]
From 1986 to 1989, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. grew by an average of 12 stores per year, bringing the total locations to over 100 stores in the U.S.[16] The company partnered with Time-Life Books in 1992 to release its first series of Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library cookbooks.[24] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange starting in 1998, while sales reached $1 billion for the first time.[16][25]
The following year, Williams-Sonoma Inc. launched its e-commerce website and bridal registry.[26][27] The company also launched Pottery Barn Kids, a spin-off of Pottery Barn that specializes in home furnishings for children.[28]
2001 to present[edit]
The West Elm brand was launched in 2002 with the release of a catalog;[29] the following year, the brand opened its first store.[30] The Pottery Barn brand further expanded with the launch of PBteen in early 2003.
In 2004, Williams-Sonoma entered into an agreement with the CBS News weekday program The Early Show to broadcast a segment, "The 5-Minute Cooking School," which presented cooking techniques, styles, and recipes. The special weekly series was televised from Williams-Sonoma's East Coast flagship store at The Shops at Columbus Circle in New York City's Time Warner Center.[31] This was followed by the debut of upscale Williams-Sonoma Home in 2005. Pottery Barn extended its merchandising with the introduction of the Pottery Barn Bed & Bath and Pottery Barn Kids in Manhattan.[32]
By 2009, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. was operating 610 stores with an annual revenue of over $3 billion.[20] In May 2010, Lester retired, and Laura Alber was named CEO of the umbrella organization. Previously, Alber joined the company in 1995. She was active in building the Pottery Barn catalog and the development and launch of Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen.[33] In November 2011, the company acquired Portland, Oregon-based Rejuvenation, Inc., a manufacturer and direct marketer of light fixtures and hardware with stores in Portland, Seattle, and Los Angeles.[34] The company launched a lifestyle brand offering personalized products, Mark and Graham, in November 2012.[35]
Williams-Sonoma opened a store at the site of its original location in Sonoma, California, in 2014. Williams-Sonoma founder Chuck Williams celebrated his 99th birthday on the store's opening on October 2, 2014.[36] The company's e-commerce sales were approximately 52 percent of Williams-Sonoma, Inc.'s revenue of the first quarter of 2015. The company maintains over 600 stores in North America, Australia, the Middle East, and the United Kingdom.[37]
West Elm Hotels[edit]

Through the West Elm brand, the company is launching West Elm Hotels.[38] The joint venture will be done with DDK, which is a hospitality management and development company. The joint venture is expected to launch properties in secondary markets such as Detroit, Minneapolis, Savannah, Georgia, Charlotte, and Indianapolis. The properties are projected to open in Q4 2018.[38]
The company is expanding into this new market in light of 26 consecutive quarters of double digit comparative growth.[38] The properties will reflect the local design elements and cuisine and culture from the region. Further, artwork for the common areas and rooms will be commissioned from local artists.[38] In a twist, hotel patrons will be able to buy the furniture used in the hotels online.[39] The West Elm Hotel brand will compete in the boutique hotel market, which the company says is what consumer are demanding. Customers want 'unique experiences' rather than 'standardization' from hotel operators.[39] Boutique hotel management is DDK’s specialty and core competency. DDK's founding and current principals have developed and currently operate more than 70 properties globally.[38] According to STR, a data and analytics company, there is room for growth in the boutique hotel market. Despite the market growing 24% over the past six years, the total number of boutique hotels only represent 2% of the total hotel room market supply.[39] Employees were able to test out the rooms that will be built in the hotels in a Brooklyn warehouse. Cigarette butts and soda as well as other substances were dumped and tested on the fabrics to check for quality. The company will choose to use dim lighting in the hallway, as it has shown that people are quieter when it’s dark.[39]
International presence[edit]
In October 2001, the company opened its first international stores in Toronto, Canada.[40] In 2008, the company opened Pottery Barn and West Elm stores at Plaza Las Americas in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, a district of the capital San Juan.[41]
In 2010, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. partnered with M.H. Alshaya Co. to launch Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids franchise operations in the Middle East.[9] The first Williams-Sonoma brand store outside of North America opened in Kuwait in 2012, along with West Elm at The Avenues Mall, the largest shopping center in Kuwait. The company also opened four stores (Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, and West Elm) in Australia as the first retail locations outside of North America owned and operated by Williams-Sonoma, Inc.[9]
The company opened its first store in the United Kingdom in 2014 with the launch of its West Elm location in London.[42] Williams-Sonoma signed a franchise agreement in 2014 to begin opening stores and operating its e-commerce sites for six of its brands in Mexico.[43] In the same year, the company also opened Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids stores with a franchise partner in the Philippines.[44]

In the film The Muse, all the kitchen supplies used to manufacture the wives' cookies were purchased at Williams-Sonoma. In the musical Dear Edwina, one song references "Williams" and "Sonoma" as being people that sing along with the Fairy Forkmother to teach a chef how to set a table.
In 2012, PBteen announced a collaboration with Burton Snowboards. The collection included bedding, lighting, and decor.[48]
The West Elm brand is active with the Clinton Global Initiative and in 2013 agreed to invest $35 million on hand made goods from U.S. and abroad to sell in its stores over the course of two years. The collaborations were aimed to positively impact over 4,000 artisan workers.[49] Former President Bill Clinton visited a West Elm showroom after the company spent nearly that amount in the first year of the agreement.[50] In 2015, the company made a pledge at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting to expand its Fair Trade Certified product offerings.[51]
In 2015, Pottery Barn collaborated with designer Ken Fulk to introduce the company's first major designer produced collection. The collection includes 60 pieces of furniture, accessories, and tableware.[52]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1947, Charles E. (Chuck) Williams settled in Sonoma, California, and opened his first shop as a hardware store. In 1953, Williams took his first trip to France. He quickly fell in love with French kitchenware such as copper cookware, and is quoted as saying, "I knew this was something that wasn’t found in America, but thought people would want."[11] Shortly after returning home, he formulated a plan to import French cooking and serving equipment into America and converted his store into a cookware shop in 1956.[12] Williams-Sonoma was founded, selling professional and restaurant-quality kitchenware for home use, leading to founder Chuck Williams being recognized as one of the titans of the American food revolution.[13]
In 1958, at the suggestion of customers,[14] Williams relocated the store to San Francisco. The store quickly became a destination with culinary figures such as Julia Child and James Beard becoming customers of the flagship location.[12] In 1972, along with—and at the suggestion of—regular customer Jackie Mallorca, Williams began publishing a mail order catalog to expand his business beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.[14] At the suggestion of customer and friend Edward Marcus, of Dallas-based Neiman Marcus, Williams decided to expand the company and formed the corporation, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in 1972.[15]
The second Williams-Sonoma store opened on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills in 1973.[16] The same year, Williams-Sonoma introduced the Cuisinart food processor to the American market through its stores and catalog.[17] Williams decided to sell his share of the company in 1978 to W. Howard Lester, an Oklahoma entrepreneur,[18] and businessman James McMahan. Williams maintained an ownership interest and guided the selection of merchandise and the production of the catalog. Lester took an active role as president and chief executive, while McMahan was the company director.[19] At the time, Williams-Sonoma had revenues of $4 million.[20]
1980 to 2000[edit]
Williams-Sonoma, Inc. had its initial public offering in July 1983. One million shares were offered on the OTC Market $23 a share.[21] At end of 1985, the company was generating over $51 million in sales.[21] In September 1986, Williams-Sonoma acquired Pottery Barn from Gap. The acquisition included Pottery Barn's 27 housewares stores located in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York for $6 million.[22] The company's expansion led to the opening of its first distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee in 1984. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is one of the largest proprietary distributors in the Memphis area with 3.5 million square feet of distribution space.[23]
From 1986 to 1989, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. grew by an average of 12 stores per year, bringing the total locations to over 100 stores in the U.S.[16] The company partnered with Time-Life Books in 1992 to release its first series of Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library cookbooks.[24] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange starting in 1998, while sales reached $1 billion for the first time.[16][25]
The following year, Williams-Sonoma Inc. launched its e-commerce website and bridal registry.[26][27] The company also launched Pottery Barn Kids, a spin-off of Pottery Barn that specializes in home furnishings for children.[28]
2001 to present[edit]
The West Elm brand was launched in 2002 with the release of a catalog;[29] the following year, the brand opened its first store.[30] The Pottery Barn brand further expanded with the launch of PBteen in early 2003.
In 2004, Williams-Sonoma entered into an agreement with the CBS News weekday program The Early Show to broadcast a segment, "The 5-Minute Cooking School," which presented cooking techniques, styles, and recipes. The special weekly series was televised from Williams-Sonoma's East Coast flagship store at The Shops at Columbus Circle in New York City's Time Warner Center.[31] This was followed by the debut of upscale Williams-Sonoma Home in 2005. Pottery Barn extended its merchandising with the introduction of the Pottery Barn Bed & Bath and Pottery Barn Kids in Manhattan.[32]
By 2009, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. was operating 610 stores with an annual revenue of over $3 billion.[20] In May 2010, Lester retired, and Laura Alber was named CEO of the umbrella organization. Previously, Alber joined the company in 1995. She was active in building the Pottery Barn catalog and the development and launch of Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen.[33] In November 2011, the company acquired Portland, Oregon-based Rejuvenation, Inc., a manufacturer and direct marketer of light fixtures and hardware with stores in Portland, Seattle, and Los Angeles.[34] The company launched a lifestyle brand offering personalized products, Mark and Graham, in November 2012.[35]
Williams-Sonoma opened a store at the site of its original location in Sonoma, California, in 2014. Williams-Sonoma founder Chuck Williams celebrated his 99th birthday on the store's opening on October 2, 2014.[36] The company's e-commerce sales were approximately 52 percent of Williams-Sonoma, Inc.'s revenue of the first quarter of 2015. The company maintains over 600 stores in North America, Australia, the Middle East, and the United Kingdom.[37]
West Elm Hotels[edit]

Through the West Elm brand, the company is launching West Elm Hotels.[38] The joint venture will be done with DDK, which is a hospitality management and development company. The joint venture is expected to launch properties in secondary markets such as Detroit, Minneapolis, Savannah, Georgia, Charlotte, and Indianapolis. The properties are projected to open in Q4 2018.[38]
The company is expanding into this new market in light of 26 consecutive quarters of double digit comparative growth.[38] The properties will reflect the local design elements and cuisine and culture from the region. Further, artwork for the common areas and rooms will be commissioned from local artists.[38] In a twist, hotel patrons will be able to buy the furniture used in the hotels online.[39] The West Elm Hotel brand will compete in the boutique hotel market, which the company says is what consumer are demanding. Customers want 'unique experiences' rather than 'standardization' from hotel operators.[39] Boutique hotel management is DDK’s specialty and core competency. DDK's founding and current principals have developed and currently operate more than 70 properties globally.[38] According to STR, a data and analytics company, there is room for growth in the boutique hotel market. Despite the market growing 24% over the past six years, the total number of boutique hotels only represent 2% of the total hotel room market supply.[39] Employees were able to test out the rooms that will be built in the hotels in a Brooklyn warehouse. Cigarette butts and soda as well as other substances were dumped and tested on the fabrics to check for quality. The company will choose to use dim lighting in the hallway, as it has shown that people are quieter when it’s dark.[39]
International presence[edit]
In October 2001, the company opened its first international stores in Toronto, Canada.[40] In 2008, the company opened Pottery Barn and West Elm stores at Plaza Las Americas in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, a district of the capital San Juan.[41]
In 2010, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. partnered with M.H. Alshaya Co. to launch Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids franchise operations in the Middle East.[9] The first Williams-Sonoma brand store outside of North America opened in Kuwait in 2012, along with West Elm at The Avenues Mall, the largest shopping center in Kuwait. The company also opened four stores (Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, and West Elm) in Australia as the first retail locations outside of North America owned and operated by Williams-Sonoma, Inc.[9]
The company opened its first store in the United Kingdom in 2014 with the launch of its West Elm location in London.[42] Williams-Sonoma signed a franchise agreement in 2014 to begin opening stores and operating its e-commerce sites for six of its brands in Mexico.[43] In the same year, the company also opened Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids stores with a franchise partner in the Philippines.[44]

Under the umbrella organization of Williams-Sonoma, Inc., the company's brands are:[10]

In popular culture[edit]
Williams-Sonoma's stores and gift registries have been referenced to on television shows including Sex and the City (Season 1, Episode 3: "Bay of Married Pigs"), American Dad! (Season 2, Episode 16: "When a Stan Loves a Woman"), Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist (Season 6, Episode 7: "Used Car"), Frasier, Mike Tyson Mysteries, and Friends.
Williams-Sonoma products have been featured numerous times on The Oprah Winfrey Show's Oprah's Favorite Things specials including Williams-Sonoma Home bedding (2004), Williams-Sonoma's croissants (2002, 2005, and 2010),[45] Williams-Sonoma's melamine mixing bowls, measuring cups, and measuring spoons (2007), Perfect Ending Cupcakes and Breville's Ikon Panini Press (sold by Williams-Sonoma) (2007),[46] and Williams-Sonoma's Waring Popcorn Maker (2014).[47]
In the film The Muse, all the kitchen supplies used to manufacture the wives' cookies were purchased at Williams-Sonoma. In the musical Dear Edwina, one song references "Williams" and "Sonoma" as being people that sing along with the Fairy Forkmother to teach a chef how to set a table.
In 2012, PBteen announced a collaboration with Burton Snowboards. The collection included bedding, lighting, and decor.[48]
The West Elm brand is active with the Clinton Global Initiative and in 2013 agreed to invest $35 million on hand made goods from U.S. and abroad to sell in its stores over the course of two years. The collaborations were aimed to positively impact over 4,000 artisan workers.[49] Former President Bill Clinton visited a West Elm showroom after the company spent nearly that amount in the first year of the agreement.[50] In 2015, the company made a pledge at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting to expand its Fair Trade Certified product offerings.[51]
In 2015, Pottery Barn collaborated with designer Ken Fulk to introduce the company's first major designer produced collection. The collection includes 60 pieces of furniture, accessories, and tableware.[52]
In August 2015, Williams-Sonoma hosted Kris Jenner at the grand re-opening of its store in The Commons at Calabasas. Jenner attended the event with daughter Khloe Kardashian and signed copies of her cookbook, In The Kitchen With Kris.[53]

Williams Sonoma (NYSE:WSM)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



Experienced Retail Executive to Drive Growth Strategies of 
      Company’s Emerging Brand

      Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE: WSM) announced today that it has named Ryan 
      Ross, an executive with more than 20 years of retail experience, to lead 
      the company’s Rejuvenation brand. Ross succeeds Alex Bellos, who 
      recently became President of the company’s West Elm brand.
    

      This is a return to Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for Ross, where from 2000-2008 
      he held positions of increasing responsibility in the company’s Pottery 
      Barn brand, culminating in the role of Vice President of e-commerce. In 
      addition to his tenure at Pottery Barn, Ross most recently served as 
      Executive Vice President of Marketing, Creative and Digital Commerce at 
      HSN, which he joined in 2013. Prior to HSN, he held strategic roles with 
      Harrods Limited and Stylus Media Group.
    

      As Executive Vice President, Ross will report directly to Laura Alber, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of Williams-Sonoma, Inc. He will 
      be responsible for driving the growth strategies of Rejuvenation, one of 
      the company’s emerging brands, which has delivered twelve consecutive 
      quarters of double-digit growth.
    

      Alber commented, “Ryan has deep expertise across all aspects of retail – 
      merchandising, product design, marketing, e-commerce and stores – with a 
      proven track record of delivering quality performance and results. His 
      extensive retail experience, his motivational and collaborative 
      leadership style, and his deep understanding of customer behavior make 
      him an exceptional choice.”
    

      Ross stated, “I’m thrilled to be a part of Williams-Sonoma, Inc. again, 
      and look forward to working alongside the Rejuvenation team to continue 
      to build this amazing brand steeped in history and founded on quality, 
      craftsmanship and wondrous discoveries.”

Williams-Sonoma - Get In On This Sale - Williams-Sonoma Inc. (NYSE:WSM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Williams-Sonoma - Get In On This SaleJul.24.17 | About: Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM) Wappinger Capital Research Media, tech, dividend growth investing, small-capWappingerCapitalSummaryBottom-fishing is a dangerous stock picking strategy but Williams-Sonoma, Inc. now has fundamentals hard to ignore.The company seems relatively undervalued compared to its industry average financial ratios.Williams-Sonoma, Inc. has the potential to be both a value stock and a growth stock, as the projected EPS growth for next 3-5 years is 14.00%.By Stavros Georgiadis, CFA Bottom-fishing is a very dangerous investing strategy, but at the same time, it can be a very profitable stock-picking strategy if the conditions for perfect timing are met. A stock which has solid fundamentals, attractive growth prospects and a nice dividend yield plus is trading at very low financial ratios compared to the average ratios of its industry and has underperformed the general stock market in the first semester of the year is very hard to ignore. Williams-Sonoma Inc. (NYSE:WSM) stock has all the mentioned characteristics, and on Friday 21st July 2017 its closing price of $45.16 was only 2.73% above its 52-week low price of $43.96. While there are no guarantees that the stock cannot move lower, the arguments in our analysis favor strongly the scenario of an upside potential, and at current price levels, the stock is a very low-risk buying opportunity. The company is one of the largest United States e-commerce retailers, with a range of well-known brands in home furnishings, such as Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma, West Elm, Mark and Graham, Rejuvenation, having a global presence and a corporate strategy focused on e-commerce and online shopping. The company focuses on continuous internet offerings on its products, with incentives and discounts, and can benefit from its online presence as global e-commerce is estimated to reach 1 trillion U.S. dollar by 2020, having a rapid growth. One very important factor that can also help the sales of Williams-Sonoma Inc. is the weak U.S. Dollar, which makes the prices of its products cheaper on an international basis. This can have a positive impact on the number of future revenues for the company. The company offers worldwide shipping and it is forecast that about 900 million worldwide consumers or about 45% of online shoppers will purchase products online by the year of 2020. These numbers show the potential growth of online shopping, and Williams Sonoma Inc. follows a marketing and business strategy that takes well into consideration the global e-commerce growth in the future years and can benefit from it.
 The stock has a series of positive EPS surprises for the past 8 quarters, with 5 positive surprises, 2 flat or zero surprises, and only 1 negative surprise. The stock for a 5-year period of fundamental analysis from 1st January of 2013 to 1st January of 2017 has a consistent increase in its EPS (both basic and diluted) for all five years, and the same trend applies as well to its dividend policy. The company has increased its dividend on an annual basis for all the past 5 years of reference. While the increase of basic EPS for 2016 was only 0.87%, to $3.45 compared to the basic EPS of $3.42 for the twelve month trailing period of January 2017 to January 2016, the 5-year average EPS growth for the month of January 2017 is 8.96%. The company is expected to have a 3-5 years EPS growth of 14.00%. This shows a potential for higher future growth, which can have a positive impact on the profitability and the stock price. The analysts are optimistic about the future economic outlook of the stock, as out of 7 analysts, 5 have a hold recommendation 1 has an outperform recommendation, 1 has a buy recommendation and none has any underperform or sell recommendation. 

 

 Source The company has a very strong balance sheet, with zero debt, good liquidity with a current ratio of 1.42 for 2017, and a mixed efficiency in management as the receivables and the inventory turnover has declined in the 5-year period of analysis from 2013-2017, but the fixed assets and the asset turnover have increased. Maybe the efficiency is the weakest sector or economic performance for the company, as the cash conversion cycle has also increased during this 5-year period, meaning the company takes more time to convert inventories to cash.
 The valuation for the stock shows that it is relatively undervalued compared to the average financial ratios of price/earnings, price/sales, price/book value, and price/cash flow.        Price Ratios Company Industry   Current P/E 13.21 44.44   Price/Sales 0.79 2.61   Price/Book Value 3.23 9.14   Price Cash Flow 7.27 22.68   Source: MSN Money Another positive factor in favor of the valuation of the Williams-Sonoma Inc. stock is the positive and rising trend in its free cash flow, as in 2017 there was an increase of about 7.0% compared the free cash flow reading in 2016. The stock offers an attractive current dividend yield of 3.45%, which can add to the future holding period return for the investors who will decide to buy the stock at current low price levels. As a conclusion our investment thesis suggests that the stock is relatively undervalued, and having underperformed the general stock market strong performance of the first semester of the year, from a contrarian point of view, the stock looks also to have increased odds of closing its underperformance gap compared to the 1-year performance of major U.S. indices such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones. The stock has a 1-year performance at the closing date of Friday 21st July 2017 of -15.60%, while the Dow Jones is up +16.20%, and S&P 500 is up +13.68% for the same period. This underperformance gap is a very significant one to ignore, but the stock has a current beta of 0.79, and is less volatile than the general stock market. This makes the stock suitable for a defensive portfolio, as the major U.S indices are now near their all-time high prices, as the stock should present less volatility in the event of any severe selloff in the stock market. The current macroeconomic conditions with a weak U.S. Dollar is an additional fundamental factor which can help the sales growth of the company in a global environment. The company and its stock can be considered both a value and a moderate growth stock pick. The fundamentals of the stock make the bottom-fishing strategy, in this case, a low-risk investing strategy.

Williams Sonoma (NYSE:WSM)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



Experienced Retail Executive to Drive Growth Strategies of 
      Company’s Emerging Brand

      Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE: WSM) announced today that it has named Ryan 
      Ross, an executive with more than 20 years of retail experience, to lead 
      the company’s Rejuvenation brand. Ross succeeds Alex Bellos, who 
      recently became President of the company’s West Elm brand.
    

      This is a return to Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for Ross, where from 2000-2008 
      he held positions of increasing responsibility in the company’s Pottery 
      Barn brand, culminating in the role of Vice President of e-commerce. In 
      addition to his tenure at Pottery Barn, Ross most recently served as 
      Executive Vice President of Marketing, Creative and Digital Commerce at 
      HSN, which he joined in 2013. Prior to HSN, he held strategic roles with 
      Harrods Limited and Stylus Media Group.
    

      As Executive Vice President, Ross will report directly to Laura Alber, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of Williams-Sonoma, Inc. He will 
      be responsible for driving the growth strategies of Rejuvenation, one of 
      the company’s emerging brands, which has delivered twelve consecutive 
      quarters of double-digit growth.
    

      Alber commented, “Ryan has deep expertise across all aspects of retail – 
      merchandising, product design, marketing, e-commerce and stores – with a 
      proven track record of delivering quality performance and results. His 
      extensive retail experience, his motivational and collaborative 
      leadership style, and his deep understanding of customer behavior make 
      him an exceptional choice.”
    

      Ross stated, “I’m thrilled to be a part of Williams-Sonoma, Inc. again, 
      and look forward to working alongside the Rejuvenation team to continue 
      to build this amazing brand steeped in history and founded on quality, 
      craftsmanship and wondrous discoveries.”

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1947, Charles E. (Chuck) Williams settled in Sonoma, California, and opened his first shop as a hardware store. In 1953, Williams took his first trip to France. He quickly fell in love with French kitchenware such as copper cookware, and is quoted as saying, "I knew this was something that wasn’t found in America, but thought people would want."[11] Shortly after returning home, he formulated a plan to import French cooking and serving equipment into America and converted his store into a cookware shop in 1956.[12] Williams-Sonoma was founded, selling professional and restaurant-quality kitchenware for home use, leading to founder Chuck Williams being recognized as one of the titans of the American food revolution.[13]
In 1958, at the suggestion of customers,[14] Williams relocated the store to San Francisco. The store quickly became a destination with culinary figures such as Julia Child and James Beard becoming customers of the flagship location.[12] In 1972, along with—and at the suggestion of—regular customer Jackie Mallorca, Williams began publishing a mail order catalog to expand his business beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.[14] At the suggestion of customer and friend Edward Marcus, of Dallas-based Neiman Marcus, Williams decided to expand the company and formed the corporation, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in 1972.[15]
The second Williams-Sonoma store opened on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills in 1973.[16] The same year, Williams-Sonoma introduced the Cuisinart food processor to the American market through its stores and catalog.[17] Williams decided to sell his share of the company in 1978 to W. Howard Lester, an Oklahoma entrepreneur,[18] and businessman James McMahan. Williams maintained an ownership interest and guided the selection of merchandise and the production of the catalog. Lester took an active role as president and chief executive, while McMahan was the company director.[19] At the time, Williams-Sonoma had revenues of $4 million.[20]
1980 to 2000[edit]
Williams-Sonoma, Inc. had its initial public offering in July 1983. One million shares were offered on the OTC Market $23 a share.[21] At end of 1985, the company was generating over $51 million in sales.[21] In September 1986, Williams-Sonoma acquired Pottery Barn from Gap. The acquisition included Pottery Barn's 27 housewares stores located in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York for $6 million.[22] The company's expansion led to the opening of its first distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee in 1984. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is one of the largest proprietary distributors in the Memphis area with 3.5 million square feet of distribution space.[23]
From 1986 to 1989, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. grew by an average of 12 stores per year, bringing the total locations to over 100 stores in the U.S.[16] The company partnered with Time-Life Books in 1992 to release its first series of Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library cookbooks.[24] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange starting in 1998, while sales reached $1 billion for the first time.[16][25]
The following year, Williams-Sonoma Inc. launched its e-commerce website and bridal registry.[26][27] The company also launched Pottery Barn Kids, a spin-off of Pottery Barn that specializes in home furnishings for children.[28]
2001 to present[edit]
The West Elm brand was launched in 2002 with the release of a catalog;[29] the following year, the brand opened its first store.[30] The Pottery Barn brand further expanded with the launch of PBteen in early 2003.
In 2004, Williams-Sonoma entered into an agreement with the CBS News weekday program The Early Show to broadcast a segment, "The 5-Minute Cooking School," which presented cooking techniques, styles, and recipes. The special weekly series was televised from Williams-Sonoma's East Coast flagship store at The Shops at Columbus Circle in New York City's Time Warner Center.[31] This was followed by the debut of upscale Williams-Sonoma Home in 2005. Pottery Barn extended its merchandising with the introduction of the Pottery Barn Bed & Bath and Pottery Barn Kids in Manhattan.[32]
By 2009, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. was operating 610 stores with an annual revenue of over $3 billion.[20] In May 2010, Lester retired, and Laura Alber was named CEO of the umbrella organization. Previously, Alber joined the company in 1995. She was active in building the Pottery Barn catalog and the development and launch of Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen.[33] In November 2011, the company acquired Portland, Oregon-based Rejuvenation, Inc., a manufacturer and direct marketer of light fixtures and hardware with stores in Portland, Seattle, and Los Angeles.[34] The company launched a lifestyle brand offering personalized products, Mark and Graham, in November 2012.[35]
Williams-Sonoma opened a store at the site of its original location in Sonoma, California, in 2014. Williams-Sonoma founder Chuck Williams celebrated his 99th birthday on the store's opening on October 2, 2014.[36] The company's e-commerce sales were approximately 52 percent of Williams-Sonoma, Inc.'s revenue of the first quarter of 2015. The company maintains over 600 stores in North America, Australia, the Middle East, and the United Kingdom.[37]
West Elm Hotels[edit]

Through the West Elm brand, the company is launching West Elm Hotels.[38] The joint venture will be done with DDK, which is a hospitality management and development company. The joint venture is expected to launch properties in secondary markets such as Detroit, Minneapolis, Savannah, Georgia, Charlotte, and Indianapolis. The properties are projected to open in Q4 2018.[38]
The company is expanding into this new market in light of 26 consecutive quarters of double digit comparative growth.[38] The properties will reflect the local design elements and cuisine and culture from the region. Further, artwork for the common areas and rooms will be commissioned from local artists.[38] In a twist, hotel patrons will be able to buy the furniture used in the hotels online.[39] The West Elm Hotel brand will compete in the boutique hotel market, which the company says is what consumer are demanding. Customers want 'unique experiences' rather than 'standardization' from hotel operators.[39] Boutique hotel management is DDK’s specialty and core competency. DDK's founding and current principals have developed and currently operate more than 70 properties globally.[38] According to STR, a data and analytics company, there is room for growth in the boutique hotel market. Despite the market growing 24% over the past six years, the total number of boutique hotels only represent 2% of the total hotel room market supply.[39] Employees were able to test out the rooms that will be built in the hotels in a Brooklyn warehouse. Cigarette butts and soda as well as other substances were dumped and tested on the fabrics to check for quality. The company will choose to use dim lighting in the hallway, as it has shown that people are quieter when it’s dark.[39]
International presence[edit]
In October 2001, the company opened its first international stores in Toronto, Canada.[40] In 2008, the company opened Pottery Barn and West Elm stores at Plaza Las Americas in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, a district of the capital San Juan.[41]
In 2010, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. partnered with M.H.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1947, Charles E. (Chuck) Williams settled in Sonoma, California, and opened his first shop as a hardware store. In 1953, Williams took his first trip to France. He quickly fell in love with French kitchenware such as copper cookware, and is quoted as saying, "I knew this was something that wasn’t found in America, but thought people would want."[11] Shortly after returning home, he formulated a plan to import French cooking and serving equipment into America and converted his store into a cookware shop in 1956.[12] Williams-Sonoma was founded, selling professional and restaurant-quality kitchenware for home use, leading to founder Chuck Williams being recognized as one of the titans of the American food revolution.[13]
In 1958, at the suggestion of customers,[14] Williams relocated the store to San Francisco. The store quickly became a destination with culinary figures such as Julia Child and James Beard becoming customers of the flagship location.[12] In 1972, along with—and at the suggestion of—regular customer Jackie Mallorca, Williams began publishing a mail order catalog to expand his business beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.[14] At the suggestion of customer and friend Edward Marcus, of Dallas-based Neiman Marcus, Williams decided to expand the company and formed the corporation, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in 1972.[15]
The second Williams-Sonoma store opened on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills in 1973.[16] The same year, Williams-Sonoma introduced the Cuisinart food processor to the American market through its stores and catalog.[17] Williams decided to sell his share of the company in 1978 to W. Howard Lester, an Oklahoma entrepreneur,[18] and businessman James McMahan. Williams maintained an ownership interest and guided the selection of merchandise and the production of the catalog. Lester took an active role as president and chief executive, while McMahan was the company director.[19] At the time, Williams-Sonoma had revenues of $4 million.[20]
1980 to 2000[edit]
Williams-Sonoma, Inc. had its initial public offering in July 1983. One million shares were offered on the OTC Market $23 a share.[21] At end of 1985, the company was generating over $51 million in sales.[21] In September 1986, Williams-Sonoma acquired Pottery Barn from Gap. The acquisition included Pottery Barn's 27 housewares stores located in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York for $6 million.[22] The company's expansion led to the opening of its first distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee in 1984. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is one of the largest proprietary distributors in the Memphis area with 3.5 million square feet of distribution space.[23]
From 1986 to 1989, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. grew by an average of 12 stores per year, bringing the total locations to over 100 stores in the U.S.[16] The company partnered with Time-Life Books in 1992 to release its first series of Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library cookbooks.[24] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange starting in 1998, while sales reached $1 billion for the first time.[16][25]
The following year, Williams-Sonoma Inc. launched its e-commerce website and bridal registry.[26][27] The company also launched Pottery Barn Kids, a spin-off of Pottery Barn that specializes in home furnishings for children.[28]
2001 to present[edit]
The West Elm brand was launched in 2002 with the release of a catalog;[29] the following year, the brand opened its first store.[30] The Pottery Barn brand further expanded with the launch of PBteen in early 2003.
In 2004, Williams-Sonoma entered into an agreement with the CBS News weekday program The Early Show to broadcast a segment, "The 5-Minute Cooking School," which presented cooking techniques, styles, and recipes. The special weekly series was televised from Williams-Sonoma's East Coast flagship store at The Shops at Columbus Circle in New York City's Time Warner Center.[31] This was followed by the debut of upscale Williams-Sonoma Home in 2005. Pottery Barn extended its merchandising with the introduction of the Pottery Barn Bed & Bath and Pottery Barn Kids in Manhattan.[32]
By 2009, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. was operating 610 stores with an annual revenue of over $3 billion.[20] In May 2010, Lester retired, and Laura Alber was named CEO of the umbrella organization. Previously, Alber joined the company in 1995. She was active in building the Pottery Barn catalog and the development and launch of Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen.[33] In November 2011, the company acquired Portland, Oregon-based Rejuvenation, Inc., a manufacturer and direct marketer of light fixtures and hardware with stores in Portland, Seattle, and Los Angeles.[34] The company launched a lifestyle brand offering personalized products, Mark and Graham, in November 2012.[35]
Williams-Sonoma opened a store at the site of its original location in Sonoma, California, in 2014. Williams-Sonoma founder Chuck Williams celebrated his 99th birthday on the store's opening on October 2, 2014.[36] The company's e-commerce sales were approximately 52 percent of Williams-Sonoma, Inc.'s revenue of the first quarter of 2015. The company maintains over 600 stores in North America, Australia, the Middle East, and the United Kingdom.[37]
West Elm Hotels[edit]

Through the West Elm brand, the company is launching West Elm Hotels.[38] The joint venture will be done with DDK, which is a hospitality management and development company. The joint venture is expected to launch properties in secondary markets such as Detroit, Minneapolis, Savannah, Georgia, Charlotte, and Indianapolis. The properties are projected to open in Q4 2018.[38]
The company is expanding into this new market in light of 26 consecutive quarters of double digit comparative growth.[38] The properties will reflect the local design elements and cuisine and culture from the region. Further, artwork for the common areas and rooms will be commissioned from local artists.[38] In a twist, hotel patrons will be able to buy the furniture used in the hotels online.[39] The West Elm Hotel brand will compete in the boutique hotel market, which the company says is what consumer are demanding. Customers want 'unique experiences' rather than 'standardization' from hotel operators.[39] Boutique hotel management is DDK’s specialty and core competency. DDK's founding and current principals have developed and currently operate more than 70 properties globally.[38] According to STR, a data and analytics company, there is room for growth in the boutique hotel market. Despite the market growing 24% over the past six years, the total number of boutique hotels only represent 2% of the total hotel room market supply.[39] Employees were able to test out the rooms that will be built in the hotels in a Brooklyn warehouse. Cigarette butts and soda as well as other substances were dumped and tested on the fabrics to check for quality. The company will choose to use dim lighting in the hallway, as it has shown that people are quieter when it’s dark.[39]
International presence[edit]
In October 2001, the company opened its first international stores in Toronto, Canada.[40] In 2008, the company opened Pottery Barn and West Elm stores at Plaza Las Americas in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, a district of the capital San Juan.[41]
In 2010, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. partnered with M.H. Alshaya Co. to launch Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids franchise operations in the Middle East.[9] The first Williams-Sonoma brand store outside of North America opened in Kuwait in 2012, along with West Elm at The Avenues Mall, the largest shopping center in Kuwait. The company also opened four stores (Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, and West Elm) in Australia as the first retail locations outside of North America owned and operated by Williams-Sonoma, Inc.[9]
The company opened its first store in the United Kingdom in 2014 with the launch of its West Elm location in London.[42] Williams-Sonoma signed a franchise agreement in 2014 to begin opening stores and operating its e-commerce sites for six of its brands in Mexico.[43] In the same year, the company also opened Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids stores with a franchise partner in the Philippines.[44]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1947, Charles E. (Chuck) Williams settled in Sonoma, California, and opened his first shop as a hardware store. In 1953, Williams took his first trip to France. He quickly fell in love with French kitchenware such as copper cookware, and is quoted as saying, "I knew this was something that wasn’t found in America, but thought people would want."[11] Shortly after returning home, he formulated a plan to import French cooking and serving equipment into America and converted his store into a cookware shop in 1956.[12] Williams-Sonoma was founded, selling professional and restaurant-quality kitchenware for home use, leading to founder Chuck Williams being recognized as one of the titans of the American food revolution.[13]
In 1958, at the suggestion of customers,[14] Williams relocated the store to San Francisco. The store quickly became a destination with culinary figures such as Julia Child and James Beard becoming customers of the flagship location.[12] In 1972, along with—and at the suggestion of—regular customer Jackie Mallorca, Williams began publishing a mail order catalog to expand his business beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.[14] At the suggestion of customer and friend Edward Marcus, of Dallas-based Neiman Marcus, Williams decided to expand the company and formed the corporation, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in 1972.[15]
The second Williams-Sonoma store opened on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills in 1973.[16] The same year, Williams-Sonoma introduced the Cuisinart food processor to the American market through its stores and catalog.[17] Williams decided to sell his share of the company in 1978 to W. Howard Lester, an Oklahoma entrepreneur,[18] and businessman James McMahan. Williams maintained an ownership interest and guided the selection of merchandise and the production of the catalog. Lester took an active role as president and chief executive, while McMahan was the company director.[19] At the time, Williams-Sonoma had revenues of $4 million.[20]
1980 to 2000[edit]
Williams-Sonoma, Inc. had its initial public offering in July 1983. One million shares were offered on the OTC Market $23 a share.[21] At end of 1985, the company was generating over $51 million in sales.[21] In September 1986, Williams-Sonoma acquired Pottery Barn from Gap. The acquisition included Pottery Barn's 27 housewares stores located in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York for $6 million.[22] The company's expansion led to the opening of its first distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee in 1984. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is one of the largest proprietary distributors in the Memphis area with 3.5 million square feet of distribution space.[23]
From 1986 to 1989, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. grew by an average of 12 stores per year, bringing the total locations to over 100 stores in the U.S.[16] The company partnered with Time-Life Books in 1992 to release its first series of Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library cookbooks.[24] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange starting in 1998, while sales reached $1 billion for the first time.[16][25]
The following year, Williams-Sonoma Inc. launched its e-commerce website and bridal registry.[26][27] The company also launched Pottery Barn Kids, a spin-off of Pottery Barn that specializes in home furnishings for children.[28]
2001 to present[edit]
The West Elm brand was launched in 2002 with the release of a catalog;[29] the following year, the brand opened its first store.[30] The Pottery Barn brand further expanded with the launch of PBteen in early 2003.
In 2004, Williams-Sonoma entered into an agreement with the CBS News weekday program The Early Show to broadcast a segment, "The 5-Minute Cooking School," which presented cooking techniques, styles, and recipes. The special weekly series was televised from Williams-Sonoma's East Coast flagship store at The Shops at Columbus Circle in New York City's Time Warner Center.[31] This was followed by the debut of upscale Williams-Sonoma Home in 2005. Pottery Barn extended its merchandising with the introduction of the Pottery Barn Bed & Bath and Pottery Barn Kids in Manhattan.[32]
By 2009, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. was operating 610 stores with an annual revenue of over $3 billion.[20] In May 2010, Lester retired, and Laura Alber was named CEO of the umbrella organization. Previously, Alber joined the company in 1995. She was active in building the Pottery Barn catalog and the development and launch of Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen.[33] In November 2011, the company acquired Portland, Oregon-based Rejuvenation, Inc., a manufacturer and direct marketer of light fixtures and hardware with stores in Portland, Seattle, and Los Angeles.[34] The company launched a lifestyle brand offering personalized products, Mark and Graham, in November 2012.[35]
Williams-Sonoma opened a store at the site of its original location in Sonoma, California, in 2014. Williams-Sonoma founder Chuck Williams celebrated his 99th birthday on the store's opening on October 2, 2014.[36] The company's e-commerce sales were approximately 52 percent of Williams-Sonoma, Inc.'s revenue of the first quarter of 2015. The company maintains over 600 stores in North America, Australia, the Middle East, and the United Kingdom.[37]
West Elm Hotels[edit]

Through the West Elm brand, the company is launching West Elm Hotels.[38] The joint venture will be done with DDK, which is a hospitality management and development company. The joint venture is expected to launch properties in secondary markets such as Detroit, Minneapolis, Savannah, Georgia, Charlotte, and Indianapolis. The properties are projected to open in Q4 2018.[38]
The company is expanding into this new market in light of 26 consecutive quarters of double digit comparative growth.[38] The properties will reflect the local design elements and cuisine and culture from the region. Further, artwork for the common areas and rooms will be commissioned from local artists.[38] In a twist, hotel patrons will be able to buy the furniture used in the hotels online.[39] The West Elm Hotel brand will compete in the boutique hotel market, which the company says is what consumer are demanding. Customers want 'unique experiences' rather than 'standardization' from hotel operators.[39] Boutique hotel management is DDK’s specialty and core competency. DDK's founding and current principals have developed and currently operate more than 70 properties globally.[38] According to STR, a data and analytics company, there is room for growth in the boutique hotel market. Despite the market growing 24% over the past six years, the total number of boutique hotels only represent 2% of the total hotel room market supply.[39] Employees were able to test out the rooms that will be built in the hotels in a Brooklyn warehouse. Cigarette butts and soda as well as other substances were dumped and tested on the fabrics to check for quality. The company will choose to use dim lighting in the hallway, as it has shown that people are quieter when it’s dark.[39]
International presence[edit]
In October 2001, the company opened its first international stores in Toronto, Canada.[40] In 2008, the company opened Pottery Barn and West Elm stores at Plaza Las Americas in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, a district of the capital San Juan.[41]
In 2010, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. partnered with M.H. Alshaya Co. to launch Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids franchise operations in the Middle East.[9] The first Williams-Sonoma brand store outside of North America opened in Kuwait in 2012, along with West Elm at The Avenues Mall, the largest shopping center in Kuwait. The company also opened four stores (Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, and West Elm) in Australia as the first retail locations outside of North America owned and operated by Williams-Sonoma, Inc.[9]
The company opened its first store in the United Kingdom in 2014 with the launch of its West Elm location in London.[42] Williams-Sonoma signed a franchise agreement in 2014 to begin opening stores and operating its e-commerce sites for six of its brands in Mexico.[43] In the same year, the company also opened Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids stores with a franchise partner in the Philippines.[44]

Under the umbrella organization of Williams-Sonoma, Inc., the company's brands are:[10]

In popular culture[edit]
Williams-Sonoma's stores and gift registries have been referenced to on television shows including Sex and the City (Season 1, Episode 3: "Bay of Married Pigs"), American Dad! (Season 2, Episode 16: "When a Stan Loves a Woman"), Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist (Season 6, Episode 7: "Used Car"), Frasier, Mike Tyson Mysteries, and Friends.
Williams-Sonoma products have been featured numerous times on The Oprah Winfrey Show's Oprah's Favorite Things specials including Williams-Sonoma Home bedding (2004), Williams-Sonoma's croissants (2002, 2005, and 2010),[45] Williams-Sonoma's melamine mixing bowls, measuring cups, and measuring spoons (2007), Perfect Ending Cupcakes and Breville's Ikon Panini Press (sold by Williams-Sonoma) (2007),[46] and Williams-Sonoma's Waring Popcorn Maker (2014).[47]
In the film The Muse, all the kitchen supplies used to manufacture the wives' cookies were purchased at Williams-Sonoma. In the musical Dear Edwina, one song references "Williams" and "Sonoma" as being people that sing along with the Fairy Forkmother to teach a chef how to set a table.
In 2012, PBteen announced a collaboration with Burton Snowboards. The collection included bedding, lighting, and decor.[48]
The West Elm brand is active with the Clinton Global Initiative and in 2013 agreed to invest $35 million on hand made goods from U.S. and abroad to sell in its stores over the course of two years. The collaborations were aimed to positively impact over 4,000 artisan workers.[49] Former President Bill Clinton visited a West Elm showroom after the company spent nearly that amount in the first year of the agreement.[50] In 2015, the company made a pledge at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting to expand its Fair Trade Certified product offerings.[51]
In 2015, Pottery Barn collaborated with designer Ken Fulk to introduce the company's first major designer produced collection. The collection includes 60 pieces of furniture, accessories, and tableware.[52]
In August 2015, Williams-Sonoma hosted Kris Jenner at the grand re-opening of its store in The Commons at Calabasas. Jenner attended the event with daughter Khloe Kardashian and signed copies of her cookbook, In The Kitchen With Kris.[53]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1947, Charles E. (Chuck) Williams settled in Sonoma, California, and opened his first shop as a hardware store. In 1953, Williams took his first trip to France. He quickly fell in love with French kitchenware such as copper cookware, and is quoted as saying, "I knew this was something that wasn’t found in America, but thought people would want."[11] Shortly after returning home, he formulated a plan to import French cooking and serving equipment into America and converted his store into a cookware shop in 1956.[12] Williams-Sonoma was founded, selling professional and restaurant-quality kitchenware for home use, leading to founder Chuck Williams being recognized as one of the titans of the American food revolution.[13]
In 1958, at the suggestion of customers,[14] Williams relocated the store to San Francisco. The store quickly became a destination with culinary figures such as Julia Child and James Beard becoming customers of the flagship location.[12] In 1972, along with—and at the suggestion of—regular customer Jackie Mallorca, Williams began publishing a mail order catalog to expand his business beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.[14] At the suggestion of customer and friend Edward Marcus, of Dallas-based Neiman Marcus, Williams decided to expand the company and formed the corporation, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in 1972.[15]
The second Williams-Sonoma store opened on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills in 1973.[16] The same year, Williams-Sonoma introduced the Cuisinart food processor to the American market through its stores and catalog.[17] Williams decided to sell his share of the company in 1978 to W. Howard Lester, an Oklahoma entrepreneur,[18] and businessman James McMahan. Williams maintained an ownership interest and guided the selection of merchandise and the production of the catalog. Lester took an active role as president and chief executive, while McMahan was the company director.[19] At the time, Williams-Sonoma had revenues of $4 million.[20]
1980 to 2000[edit]
Williams-Sonoma, Inc. had its initial public offering in July 1983. One million shares were offered on the OTC Market $23 a share.[21] At end of 1985, the company was generating over $51 million in sales.[21] In September 1986, Williams-Sonoma acquired Pottery Barn from Gap. The acquisition included Pottery Barn's 27 housewares stores located in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York for $6 million.[22] The company's expansion led to the opening of its first distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee in 1984. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is one of the largest proprietary distributors in the Memphis area with 3.5 million square feet of distribution space.[23]
From 1986 to 1989, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. grew by an average of 12 stores per year, bringing the total locations to over 100 stores in the U.S.[16] The company partnered with Time-Life Books in 1992 to release its first series of Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library cookbooks.[24] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange starting in 1998, while sales reached $1 billion for the first time.[16][25]
The following year, Williams-Sonoma Inc. launched its e-commerce website and bridal registry.[26][27] The company also launched Pottery Barn Kids, a spin-off of Pottery Barn that specializes in home furnishings for children.[28]
2001 to present[edit]
The West Elm brand was launched in 2002 with the release of a catalog;[29] the following year, the brand opened its first store.[30] The Pottery Barn brand further expanded with the launch of PBteen in early 2003.
In 2004, Williams-Sonoma entered into an agreement with the CBS News weekday program The Early Show to broadcast a segment, "The 5-Minute Cooking School," which presented cooking techniques, styles, and recipes. The special weekly series was televised from Williams-Sonoma's East Coast flagship store at The Shops at Columbus Circle in New York City's Time Warner Center.[31] This was followed by the debut of upscale Williams-Sonoma Home in 2005. Pottery Barn extended its merchandising with the introduction of the Pottery Barn Bed & Bath and Pottery Barn Kids in Manhattan.[32]
By 2009, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. was operating 610 stores with an annual revenue of over $3 billion.[20] In May 2010, Lester retired, and Laura Alber was named CEO of the umbrella organization. Previously, Alber joined the company in 1995. She was active in building the Pottery Barn catalog and the development and launch of Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen.[33] In November 2011, the company acquired Portland, Oregon-based Rejuvenation, Inc., a manufacturer and direct marketer of light fixtures and hardware with stores in Portland, Seattle, and Los Angeles.[34] The company launched a lifestyle brand offering personalized products, Mark and Graham, in November 2012.[35]
Williams-Sonoma opened a store at the site of its original location in Sonoma, California, in 2014. Williams-Sonoma founder Chuck Williams celebrated his 99th birthday on the store's opening on October 2, 2014.[36] The company's e-commerce sales were approximately 52 percent of Williams-Sonoma, Inc.'s revenue of the first quarter of 2015. The company maintains over 600 stores in North America, Australia, the Middle East, and the United Kingdom.[37]
West Elm Hotels[edit]

Through the West Elm brand, the company is launching West Elm Hotels.[38] The joint venture will be done with DDK, which is a hospitality management and development company. The joint venture is expected to launch properties in secondary markets such as Detroit, Minneapolis, Savannah, Georgia, Charlotte, and Indianapolis. The properties are projected to open in Q4 2018.[38]
The company is expanding into this new market in light of 26 consecutive quarters of double digit comparative growth.[38] The properties will reflect the local design elements and cuisine and culture from the region. Further, artwork for the common areas and rooms will be commissioned from local artists.[38] In a twist, hotel patrons will be able to buy the furniture used in the hotels online.[39] The West Elm Hotel brand will compete in the boutique hotel market, which the company says is what consumer are demanding. Customers want 'unique experiences' rather than 'standardization' from hotel operators.[39] Boutique hotel management is DDK’s specialty and core competency. DDK's founding and current principals have developed and currently operate more than 70 properties globally.[38] According to STR, a data and analytics company, there is room for growth in the boutique hotel market. Despite the market growing 24% over the past six years, the total number of boutique hotels only represent 2% of the total hotel room market supply.[39] Employees were able to test out the rooms that will be built in the hotels in a Brooklyn warehouse. Cigarette butts and soda as well as other substances were dumped and tested on the fabrics to check for quality. The company will choose to use dim lighting in the hallway, as it has shown that people are quieter when it’s dark.[39]
International presence[edit]
In October 2001, the company opened its first international stores in Toronto, Canada.[40] In 2008, the company opened Pottery Barn and West Elm stores at Plaza Las Americas in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, a district of the capital San Juan.[41]
In 2010, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. partnered with M.H. Alshaya Co. to launch Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids franchise operations in the Middle East.[9] The first Williams-Sonoma brand store outside of North America opened in Kuwait in 2012, along with West Elm at The Avenues Mall, the largest shopping center in Kuwait. The company also opened four stores (Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, and West Elm) in Australia as the first retail locations outside of North America owned and operated by Williams-Sonoma, Inc.[9]
The company opened its first store in the United Kingdom in 2014 with the launch of its West Elm location in London.[42] Williams-Sonoma signed a franchise agreement in 2014 to begin opening stores and operating its e-commerce sites for six of its brands in Mexico.[43] In the same year, the company also opened Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids stores with a franchise partner in the Philippines.[44]

Under the umbrella organization of Williams-Sonoma, Inc., the company's brands are:[10]

In popular culture[edit]
Williams-Sonoma's stores and gift registries have been referenced to on television shows including Sex and the City (Season 1, Episode 3: "Bay of Married Pigs"), American Dad! (Season 2, Episode 16: "When a Stan Loves a Woman"), Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist (Season 6, Episode 7: "Used Car"), Frasier, Mike Tyson Mysteries, and Friends.
Williams-Sonoma products have been featured numerous times on The Oprah Winfrey Show's Oprah's Favorite Things specials including Williams-Sonoma Home bedding (2004), Williams-Sonoma's croissants (2002, 2005, and 2010),[45] Williams-Sonoma's melamine mixing bowls, measuring cups, and measuring spoons (2007), Perfect Ending Cupcakes and Breville's Ikon Panini Press (sold by Williams-Sonoma) (2007),[46] and Williams-Sonoma's Waring Popcorn Maker (2014).[47]
In the film The Muse, all the kitchen supplies used to manufacture the wives' cookies were purchased at Williams-Sonoma. In the musical Dear Edwina, one song references "Williams" and "Sonoma" as being people that sing along with the Fairy Forkmother to teach a chef how to set a table.
In 2012, PBteen announced a collaboration with Burton Snowboards. The collection included bedding, lighting, and decor.[48]
The West Elm brand is active with the Clinton Global Initiative and in 2013 agreed to invest $35 million on hand made goods from U.S. and abroad to sell in its stores over the course of two years. The collaborations were aimed to positively impact over 4,000 artisan workers.[49] Former President Bill Clinton visited a West Elm showroom after the company spent nearly that amount in the first year of the agreement.[50] In 2015, the company made a pledge at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting to expand its Fair Trade Certified product offerings.[51]
In 2015, Pottery Barn collaborated with designer Ken Fulk to introduce the company's first major designer produced collection. The collection includes 60 pieces of furniture, accessories, and tableware.[52]
In August 2015, Williams-Sonoma hosted Kris Jenner at the grand re-opening of its store in The Commons at Calabasas. Jenner attended the event with daughter Khloe Kardashian and signed copies of her cookbook, In The Kitchen With Kris.[53]

Williams-Sonoma Expands to South Korea


 


			MCM Staff		

July 27, 2017

 

Williams-Sonoma, Inc. announced the opening of its brands’ first stores in Seoul, South Korea under its strategic franchise agreement with Hyundai Livart Furniture, a premier home goods retailer. Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids opened a combined store and West Elm opened a store at Hyundai City Mall Garden 5. Williams Sonoma opened at Hyundai Department store Mokdong. These openings are the first of 30 stores from the Williams-Sonoma, Inc. brand portfolio expected to open across South Korea over the next 10 years.
“This is an exciting milestone in our global expansion,” said Laura Alber, President and Chief Executive Officer of Williams-Sonoma, Inc. “We are proud to open our first stores in Seoul and introduce our distinctive brands, excellent customer service, and exceptional products to customers in South Korea.”
“We currently operate retail stores in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, and franchise our brands to third parties in a number of countries in the Middle East, the Philippines, and Mexico. By the end of this year Williams-Sonoma, Inc. will be represented at more than 145 international retail locations,” said Ronald Young, Executive Vice President, Global of Williams–Sonoma, Inc. “As we begin our partnership with Livart opening our first four stores of many to come in South Korea, we look forward to the tremendous opportunity of continuing our global expansion.”
“The first Williams-Sonoma, Inc. store openings bring a big change to the domestic home furnishings market in South Korea,” said Hwa-Eung Kim, Representative Director and Chief Executive Officer of Hyundai Livart Furniture Co. Ltd. “Our partnership with Williams-Sonoma, Inc. helps us bring the best quality and differentiated design offerings to customers, and we are looking forward to opening additional stores in Seoul and in other major cities across South Korea soon.”
This October, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. and Livart will open a five-story flagship store in Nonhyun-dong, Seoul. The superstore will include Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, and West Elm, and will represent the first time three Williams-Sonoma, Inc. brands are offered in a single standalone location. An additional Williams Sonoma store will be opened in the Hyundai City Mall Daegu branch in the latter half of this year.

Williams-Sonoma Expands to South Korea


 


			MCM Staff

Williams-Sonoma, Inc. announced the opening of its brands’ first stores in Seoul, South Korea under its strategic franchise agreement with Hyundai Livart Furniture, a premier home goods retailer. Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids opened a combined store and West Elm opened a store at Hyundai City Mall Garden 5. Williams Sonoma opened at Hyundai Department store Mokdong.

THE REGISTRY

                    If the Ring Finger Isn't a Green Thumb                
NOT every bride or bridegroom has a green thumb, the desire to maintain a garden or even the luxury of outdoor space. But a touch of green is within everyone's reach. Low-maintenance terrariums or indoor cactus gardens make cheerful, lasting gifts. And cooks who enjoy fresh ingredients can grow herbs or harvest a crop of mushrooms just an arm's length away in their own kitchen. For newlyweds who do have a yard, there is a sequoia sapling that will grow (one to three feet a year!) with the marriage, as well as new chairs to decorate a patio or terrace. For couples who prefer to sit indoors by their coffee table, a new book of photography by the New York landscape artist Paula Hayes will be available later this month.











                    Growth Opportunities                
WILLIAMS-SONOMA, the company that has lured every amateur Alice Waters into the kitchen with the promise of gleaming, chef-grade pots and pans and all manner of specialized countertop appliances, not only wants you to prepare your own food but also to grow it. It has introduced Agrarian, a collection of just about everything one might possibly need to make the leap from seed to table, including cedar garden beds, organic soil, heirloom seeds, copper gardening tools, even a chic dark denim gardening apron. For the more adventurous, there are portable chicken coops (above). Or for those who don't want to get their hands dirty there all the accouterments for ''putting up'' the fruits and vegetables you ''picked'' at your local farmers' market. In keeping with the locavore spirit, the emphasis is on small producers like Brooklyn Slate, which makes garden markers, and Fire Escape Farms, a company in Northern California whose leafy greens and seed packets are also part of the mix. ''It's about building community through food,'' said Daron Joffe (affectionately known as Farmer D), an organic farmer and advocate who produces the raised beds from sustainably harvested cedar in Atlanta. ''There is a lot of opportunity for growth.'' ALIX BROWNE














Possessed

                    The Mod Classicist in the Mirror                
A first trip to Europe at age 35 taught Gary Friedman, the chief executive of Restoration Hardware, that he had been a fan of symmetry in architecture and design all along.










Food Stuff

                    A Skillet Is a Basket Is a Grill                
Williams-Sonoma has introduced a perforated stainless-steel skillet that resembles a wire basket.











                    W. Howard Lester, Williams-Sonoma Owner, Dies at 75                
A millionaire seeking a challenge turned a small retailer into a home furnishings empire with 609 stores, a mail-order business and annual sales of $3.4 billion.










CURRENTS: TABLEWARE

                    These Bowls From Italy Say Oranges and Lemons                
The pattern looks retro. The colors also look period. Laura Cassell, a senior buyer for Williams-Sonoma, said she found these bowls and 100 percent cotton tablecloths in Italy. The tablecloth was available only in blue. She ordered it done over in citrusy colors. ''I think the really large-scale print makes it more casual and fun for breakfast,'' she said. Depending on size, the cloth is $62 to $89; four napkins, $36.










COMPANY NEWS

                    WILLIAMS-SONOMA EXPECTS TO MEET PROFIT ESTIMATES                
Williams-Sonoma Inc., owner of the Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma chains, expects to meet third-quarter and annual profit forecasts even as sales fall below previous estimates. Third-quarter earnings will be 5 cents to 7 cents a share and profit this year will be $1.17 to $1.24, the company said. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call expected the company to earn 5 cents in the third quarter, which ends Oct. 28, and $1.15 for the fiscal year, which ends Jan. 3. Sales are lower than forecast as consumers concerned about the economy buy fewer home accessories and kitchen goods after the terrorist attacks.

Shares of Williams-Sonoma Inc. rose 15 percent yesterday after the company, a retailer of kitchen goods and home furnishings, said that its most recent quarterly profit beat forecasts and that profit this year might exceed estimates. The company said it would report profit of 78 cents to 79 cents a share in the period, which ended Jan. 28 and was the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, more than the 75-cent estimate of analysts. While most retailers had their worst holiday season in at least five years, Williams-Sonoma increased profit by controlling inventory costs. Slowing consumer spending may lead to losses in the first half, the first deficit since fiscal 1997, but the company expects to rebound as new management redesigns catalogs and improves customer service. Shares of Williams-Sonoma rose $3.40, to $26.40.











                    Williams-Sonoma Warns on Profits as Catalog Sales Slacken                
Williams-Sonoma Inc., the kitchen goods and home furnishings chain, said today that its third-quarter profit would fall on lower-than-expected catalog sales and higher costs. The statement sent its shares down as much as 30 percent. The company also said that its chief financial officer, John Tate, would resign as of Nov. 1 after just 18 months.











                    Penny-Wise Classes In Cooking                
ENROLLING in a New York cooking school, or even just attending a workshop with a celebrity chef, can leave you on a noodles-only food budget for the rest of the year. But with a little resourcefulness -- and in some situations, elbow grease -- you can pursue your fantasy of becoming the next Julia Child (or just a better cook) at little cost, and sometimes at no cost at all. For example, you could become a kitchen assistant in the New School's Culinary Arts Program, which offers 170 classes each semester in the day and evening and on weekends. Students pay $90 for a three-hour course, and as much as $3,000 for a 24-week master class. Each class usually has two kitchen assistants, who can take in everything at no cost (and with no compensation).










COMPANY NEWS

                    STARBUCKS BID FOR WILLIAMS-SONOMA IS REPORTED                
The stock of the kitchenware retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc. jumped 17 percent yesterday after it was reported that the company had turned down a takeover offer earlier this month from the Starbucks Corporation. Shares of the San Francisco-based Williams-Sonoma closed at $34, up $5 each. The San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday that Starbucks, the Seattle-based coffeehouse chain, was named by people ''close to the company'' as the bidder. No price was given. Neither company would comment on the report, and analysts cautioned against assuming that a deal would happen.











                    Food Stuff                
A French Tradition For Epiphany One of France's most endearing traditions is the galette des rois, the cake served on Epiphany, the Feast of the Three Kings, on Jan. 6. Inserted in each is a trinket, a dry white bean or a small figurine, and according to one custom, the person who finds it is crowned king or queen. But another custom is somewhat less generous: the finder has to buy the next cake.

THE REGISTRY

                    If the Ring Finger Isn't a Green Thumb                
NOT every bride or bridegroom has a green thumb, the desire to maintain a garden or even the luxury of outdoor space. But a touch of green is within everyone's reach. Low-maintenance terrariums or indoor cactus gardens make cheerful, lasting gifts. And cooks who enjoy fresh ingredients can grow herbs or harvest a crop of mushrooms just an arm's length away in their own kitchen. For newlyweds who do have a yard, there is a sequoia sapling that will grow (one to three feet a year!) with the marriage, as well as new chairs to decorate a patio or terrace. For couples who prefer to sit indoors by their coffee table, a new book of photography by the New York landscape artist Paula Hayes will be available later this month.











                    Growth Opportunities                
WILLIAMS-SONOMA, the company that has lured every amateur Alice Waters into the kitchen with the promise of gleaming, chef-grade pots and pans and all manner of specialized countertop appliances, not only wants you to prepare your own food but also to grow it. It has introduced Agrarian, a collection of just about everything one might possibly need to make the leap from seed to table, including cedar garden beds, organic soil, heirloom seeds, copper gardening tools, even a chic dark denim gardening apron. For the more adventurous, there are portable chicken coops (above). Or for those who don't want to get their hands dirty there all the accouterments for ''putting up'' the fruits and vegetables you ''picked'' at your local farmers' market. In keeping with the locavore spirit, the emphasis is on small producers like Brooklyn Slate, which makes garden markers, and Fire Escape Farms, a company in Northern California whose leafy greens and seed packets are also part of the mix. ''It's about building community through food,'' said Daron Joffe (affectionately known as Farmer D), an organic farmer and advocate who produces the raised beds from sustainably harvested cedar in Atlanta. ''There is a lot of opportunity for growth.'' ALIX BROWNE

A first trip to Europe at age 35 taught Gary Friedman, the chief executive of Restoration Hardware, that he had been a fan of symmetry in architecture and design all along.










Food Stuff

                    A Skillet Is a Basket Is a Grill                
Williams-Sonoma has introduced a perforated stainless-steel skillet that resembles a wire basket.











                    W. Howard Lester, Williams-Sonoma Owner, Dies at 75                
A millionaire seeking a challenge turned a small retailer into a home furnishings empire with 609 stores, a mail-order business and annual sales of $3.4 billion.










CURRENTS: TABLEWARE

                    These Bowls From Italy Say Oranges and Lemons                
The pattern looks retro. The colors also look period. Laura Cassell, a senior buyer for Williams-Sonoma, said she found these bowls and 100 percent cotton tablecloths in Italy. The tablecloth was available only in blue. She ordered it done over in citrusy colors. ''I think the really large-scale print makes it more casual and fun for breakfast,'' she said. Depending on size, the cloth is $62 to $89; four napkins, $36.










COMPANY NEWS

                    WILLIAMS-SONOMA EXPECTS TO MEET PROFIT ESTIMATES                
Williams-Sonoma Inc., owner of the Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma chains, expects to meet third-quarter and annual profit forecasts even as sales fall below previous estimates. Third-quarter earnings will be 5 cents to 7 cents a share and profit this year will be $1.17 to $1.24, the company said. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call expected the company to earn 5 cents in the third quarter, which ends Oct. 28, and $1.15 for the fiscal year, which ends Jan. 3. Sales are lower than forecast as consumers concerned about the economy buy fewer home accessories and kitchen goods after the terrorist attacks.
