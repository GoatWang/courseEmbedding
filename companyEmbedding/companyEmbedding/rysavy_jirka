New World, Ordered


A profile of a 1995 Entrepreneur of the Year runner-up, and how he grew his company to a $1-billion business.






By Steve Solomon

 Jirka Rysavy came to America from Eastern Europe 11 years ago with no money, no understanding of capitalism, little knowledge of English, and no idea what to do next. Today, after bringing order and scale to a once-fragmented industry, he has a $1-billion business 
 FOUNDER: Jirka Rysavy, Czech immigrant with no business -- or even capitalist -- background, now 41
 MARKET ENTERED: Corporate office-products supply. Mature, fragmented industry with thousands of local suppliers
 STRATEGY: Acquire independents and consolidate and professionalize operations
 RESULT: Pretax profits of $5.2 million on sales of $621 million in fiscal year 1994; estimated sales of $1 billion in 1995. Largest company in industry* * * 
The company was for sale, and Jirka Rysavy was there to buy it. But he was not having an easy time.
It wasn't that the executives sitting around a table at Trick & Murray early in 1992 were unreasonably demanding about their company's sale. After all, Trick & Murray sold office supplies -- not the sexiest line of work. As merchants of clipboards and paper clips, the owners didn't expect to see Michael Eisner sweep into the boardroom, trailed by investment bankers bearing spreadsheets and cellular phones.
But neither had they expected someone like Jirka Rysavy (pronounced Yer-ka Ris-a-vee). He was tall, bearded, and as skinny as a scarecrow; his mumbled, halting English often made him difficult to understand. Just eight years earlier he had left his native Czechoslovakia for the United States, following an earlier visit in which he had bummed around the country, sleeping in bus stations and on park benches. It was hard at first to take him seriously. "He was not," says Ted Nark, then Trick & Murray's vice-president of sales, "a Fortune 500 kind of guy."
Nor did he run a Fortune 500 kind of company. At $31.6 million in sales, Rysavy's company, Corporate Express, was not much bigger than Trick & Murray itself, which had sales of about $15 million. "We were pretty skeptical," says Nark. "Corporate Express was by no means a major player in the industry. It all seemed a little improbable."
Not for long, it didn't. Where the Trick & Murray executives saw a marketplace offering only marginal profits, Rysavy saw a major growth opportunity. If Staples had grown large by selling office products to consumers and small companies, he would grow as quickly by becoming the dominant supplier of office products to larger companies. Already his merchandising strategy had revived an earlier acquisition in Denver. He also owned the industry's most powerfully computerized sales-and-inventory-tracking system, developed by a Czech friend, Pavel Bouska. Rysavy promised he would grow Corporate Express to $300 million in three years.
He proved to be wrong. In fact, he had promised too little. Today, three years after acquiring Trick & Murray, Corporate Express expects sales of more than $1 billion, up from $621 million (with a pretax net of $5.2 million) last year. It is the largest company in its industry. Chris Vroom, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons, expects Corporate Express, now a publicly owned company, to reach $3 billion in sales by the year 2000.
What Rysavy, who is 41, brought to Trick & Murray were lessons he had taught himself while running a tiny office-supply store in Boulder, Colo. -- a business not unlike millions of retail operations on Main Streets throughout America. But Rysavy never meant to stay small for long. He used that operation as a hothouse for testing ideas that could fix problems not only at his own business but also at dozens of other office-products suppliers around the country that he planned to acquire one day.
Rysavy sold the same staplers and steno pads as everyone else. What was different -- very different -- was that he figured out a far superior way of doing it.* * * 
Few paths to the kind of success Corporate Express has achieved are as unlikely as Rysavy's.
On September 21, 1982, Rysavy went to a downtown Prague bus depot to say good-bye to his boyhood chum Bouska, who was headed to West Germany to escape the Communist government that had detained him several times as a dissident. Friends since they enrolled in an experimental mathematics school in Prague at age 11, the two had become increasingly close over the years. Rysavy himself had been investigated three times by the secret police, suspected of dissident activities. He and Bouska had talked frequently about leaving for freedom in the West. Now Bouska was doing it, having managed to secure one of the hard-to-get exit visas that the government granted for travel abroad. In days Bouska would ask for political asylum, then sit in a West German refugee camp for six months, and finally settle into a software-development job in Munich.Unlike his friend, Rysavy had traveled outside the country, as a hurdler in international track and field events. In 1979 he used his sports connections to secure an exit visa that enabled him to take a six-month trip around the world. Half that time he spent in the United States. Although he spoke almost no English, he worked small jobs to earn a little cash. He lived on $3 a day. "I ate bread," says Rysavy. "I slept outside in parks or in airports or bus stations."
By then it was clear that Rysavy's sneakers took him in directions that few others traveled. He welcomed long stretches of time alone, practicing meditation. In 1982 he lived alone in a shed high in the mountains on the Czech-Polish border, seeing only a few people over the course of nearly a year. "I ran with the bighorn sheep," he says. He spent half of each day in meditation and the other half picking berries and other plants and attending to his basic needs.
"To learn to be alone without being lonely is very important," Rysavy says. "You realize what you're really about and what's there only as a facade. You can rethink all the rules of existence and exercise the choice of taking them as yours or not."
Rysavy left his homeland for good in 1984 after earning a master's degree in engineering. "I hated the system," he says. He did not officially defect, as had Bouska; he simply extended his visa and never returned. Rysavy headed to Boulder, a college town, to the mountains he loved and to a milieu that embraced nonconformists.
In Boulder Rysavy first worked in a print shop for $3.35 an hour. In three months he had saved the $600 he needed to start a company. Living in the mountains had given him a strong interest in the environment, so he began selling recycled paper. His company, Transformational Economy, or Transecon, made $100,000 in pretax profits in its first year. Rysavy invested $30,000 in a new enterprise, this time to satisfy another of his interests -- the strict vegetarian diet he follows. In its first year, he says, his health-food store reached profitability on $2.5 million in sales.
Rysavy had never had formal business training. In fact, even capitalism was new to him. "I knew nothing about business," he says. "In Czechoslovakia, private business was called 'illegal enrichment." To better understand the specific problems he would face as a manager, Rysavy pored over every relevant book and magazine article he could find. "It was Cornflake University -- I learned from business articles I read over breakfast," he says. "I clipped articles. I wanted to know what mistakes were made by CEOs of growing companies. So I read articles to find the relevant answers, to get ideas to think about."
He had planned to open additional health-food markets, but a touch of serendipity changed all that. One of his neighbors owned an office-supply store in downtown Boulder and wanted to sell it. The store was losing money on about $300,000 a year in sales. But when Rysavy took a look at the business, the problems seemed not at all difficult to fix. He bought the store cheaply, paying $100 and assuming $15,000 in overdue accounts payable.
When he took over, Rysavy installed a computer system to track customers and sales. It was obvious that sidewalk business could not pay the bills, but Rysavy was intrigued by a handful of successful accounts with local companies that bought office supplies in large quantities. To Rysavy the future of the operation seemed obvious: move away from retail sales and instead focus on the corporate side. Following that strategy, he says, he expanded sales nearly eightfold within a year, to $2 million, with a pretax margin of 14%. His quick success in one office-supply store made him think, Could he do the same thing in multiple locations? In the fall of 1987 Rysavy sought the answer. He hired a researcher to collect material on the office-supply industry. That December he packed a pile of documents two feet tall and went to Maui for two weeks of reading.
What Rysavy discovered in his reading was a huge industry riddled with inefficiencies. Thousands of office-supply dealers split a market worth more than $100 billion. Because almost all the dealers were small -- with less than $25 million in sales -- and served local markets, they did not enjoy the sales volume they needed to make direct purchases from manufacturers. Instead, dealers purchased most of their items from wholesalers at prices up to 30% higher than what manufacturers charged. In addition, with the number of office products exploding in recent years, most dealers carried large, slow-moving inventories.
A few savvy merchants -- Staples and Office Depot among them -- had already grasped the opportunity to bypass wholesalers. By 1987 they were just beginning to terrorize local dealers by opening superstores in which they sold office products at discounted prices. But superstores served mostly retail customers and small businesses. What Rysavy saw was an opportunity to do the same thing for midsize and large companies.Purchases by corporations with more than 100 employees accounted for $30 billion of the annual office-supplies market. And by selling directly to those customers instead of operating superstores catering to walk-ins, Rysavy was certain he could generate better returns on capital. "I figured I could cover all of the United States from 20 warehouses," he says. "Office Depot would need 2,000 superstores." He also figured that a big corporate supplier could cover the country with $40 million to $50 million in inventory, a small fraction of what a network of retail superstores would require. While merchants like Staples were opening bright new retail stores, Rysavy decided that it made more sense in the corporate side of the market to buy existing companies rather than start new operations from scratch. Corporate customers tended to remain loyal to their supplier for a number of years, so starting from scratch would require an extended period of building the business -- all the while accumulating losses. And because many local office-supply companies were doing poorly, Rysavy figured he could make the acquisitions inexpensively. After analyzing the market potential, he says, "I was astounded."
The opportunity to be first in the market would not last long, however. Rysavy knew it was time to move -- and quickly.* * * 
Rysavy found his first acquisition close to home. NBI, located in a suburb of Denver, had recorded a loss of about $1 million on sales of $20 million.
When he sold his health-food market, Rysavy had only $300,000 to invest. But this was the roaring '80s, and he managed to leverage the balance of the $12.8-million price. He seemed not at all concerned that he had put almost every dollar of his net worth into a troubled company. "I came here from Czechoslovakia a few years earlier with no money at all," he says. "What would be the worst that could happen? I'd simply go back to having no money again."
When he took over NBI's office-products division, in 1988, Rysavy began implementing the plans he had been devising for the past year. He did what had worked so successfully in his small storefront in Boulder, analyzing NBI's customer base to identify the unprofitable orders. About one out of every four orders lost money because it was too small to warrant the attendant costs -- picking the items from the warehouse, packaging them, and processing the invoices. "I cut out all the revenues that lost money," Rysavy says. As he cleared the underbrush that had ensnared NBI, work proceeded on what would become the company's most critical competitive weapon in the years ahead. An engineer by training, Rysavy understood better than anyone in the industry the importance of developing a software system that could embrace every aspect of the business. But what hotshot programmer would come to a small office-supply company run by a Czech Ã‰migrÃ‰? None, it appeared. Except maybe Pavel Bouska.
Bouska had recently come to America for the first time. He had stayed at Rysavy's 80-acre hideaway nestled 8,000 feet high in the Rocky Mountains above Boulder. Rysavy had showed him the office-supply storefront and shared his plans for the future. "He had only a few PCs at the time," says Bouska. "I was dubious. I was running a major software-development shop in Germany."
Bouska returned to Munich determined to stay where he was. "I had lost my country, everything that people consider home," he says. "All of that was gone, but I had rebuilt part of it in Germany."
But his thoughts returned again and again in the next few weeks to Rysavy and his struggle to build a company in America. On a weekend trip to the Alps, Bouska couldn't get his friend out of his mind. In 1988, with the Communists still in control of Czechoslovakia, Bouska could expect to be arrested if he returned home. But a reunion in America with a close friend with whom he had played on the streets of Prague? It tantalized him.
"That Sunday," says Bouska, "I called Jirka and said, 'I'm coming."* * * 
Bouska's software system was already in place when Rysavy made his pitch to buy Trick & Murray, in 1992. So, too, was a merchandising plan that enabled Rysavy's company to bypass the wholesaler middlemen and instead purchase office supplies directly from manufacturers.
Rysavy described to the Trick & Murray executives a strategy that was producing dramatic results. From $1 million in losses in 1988, the NBI operation was on its way to 10% operating margins. And it was enjoying much greater productivity: whereas it once took 340 employees to produce $20 million in sales, Rysavy's NBI acquisition by 1995 would employ 180 people producing sales of $65 million. In addition, by 1995 the operations would require half the inventory to support more than three times the sales.Rysavy completed the acquisition of Trick & Murray in the summer of 1992. He merged the company into two others he had acquired in the Seattle area. Eight of the nine former principals stayed on to run the combined operation, with Ted Nark taking the top job as president of the company's western region.
As he had done elsewhere, Rysavy pruned the Seattle operation both to remove withered branches and to expose the main trunk that held everything together. "We focused," says Nark, "on being the best supplier of office products to corporations." Snipped away were five retail stores as well as some services, such as the printing of business cards and letterhead. Gone, too, were redundant facilities. Rysavy also centralized many administrative responsibilities; for example, accounting functions previously done separately at the three different companies moved to headquarters in the Denver area.
By centralizing functions and eliminating redundant facilities, Corporate Express has improved operating margins by as much as 6%, according to Alex. Brown's analyst Chris Vroom. Such efficiencies are fairly common in corporate mergers across the broad landscape of American business, of course. For Rysavy, however, the most significant changes -- worth an additional 5% or so in improved operating margins -- went well beyond the standard fare. In fact, changes in the merchandising plan and in the computer system effected a complete metamorphosis of the Seattle operation.
Most office-supply companies, including Trick & Murray before it was merged into Corporate Express, give customers a catalog of 15,000 to 25,000 items from which to order. That requires the supplier to maintain a broad inventory, which is costly both because of that inventory's size and because it moves slowly. (The industry standard turnover is about four to eight times a year.) Because most suppliers are small, few of them have the scale to buy much more than half their items directly from manufacturers. Most of their inventory comes from wholesalers, who pass along a hefty markup.
Rysavy brought a far more focused merchandising strategy to the Seattle operation. What the company calls its "in-stock catalog" lists about 5,000 items, not the traditional 25,000. Customers can get everything they need, but the variety within any category is somewhat circumscribed -- perhaps the staplers do not come in emerald green, or you can't get them from every manufacturer that makes them. If a customer asks for a product that Corporate Express does not carry, the company's computer system automatically suggests a suitable alternative from the in-stock catalog. As a last resort, customers can still order from a larger, more traditional catalog, but the prices for those items typically run higher because the company obtains them from wholesalers. About 85% of Corporate Express's sales come from its in-stock catalog.
Many good things flow from that focused strategy. Corporate Express generates huge sales volumes from just 5,000 products, enabling it to negotiate bulk purchases directly from the manufacturers. According to Vroom, the company thereby gains about a 10% cost advantage -- even after passing savings on to customers -- against competitors who must buy primarily from wholesalers. With higher fill rates and lower prices than those of competitors, Corporate Express has grown not just through acquisitions but through double-digit increases in sales.
Corporate Express also gains several big advantages in its inventory. With most orders coming from its in-stock catalog, the company is able to deliver about 99% of all orders by the next business day, a percentage that's far higher than the industry norm and a key element in satisfying customers. At many companies, says Rysavy, "salespeople have to call customers and explain why the order isn't being filled quickly. That adds lots to costs, and it's a frustration for customers."
Rysavy's inventory doesn't stick around long. High volume on fewer products means faster inventory turnover. After it took over Trick & Murray, Corporate Express increased inventory turns from about 8 a year to 16. That produces fireworks on the bottom line: with inventory leaving the warehouse in about 23 days but Corporate Express paying for it in 40, the manufacturers finance not only the inventory but also much of the warehouse operations.
If Rysavy created the merchandising strategy, it was Pavel Bouska who brought the computer system to life. The system confers on Corporate Express a major advantage in the marketplace. Bo Cheadle, a senior analyst with Montgomery Securities, calls the company's inventory-control system the best in the industry. Why is that so important? "The items we sell are tiny in dollar value," says Bouska. "So we can't spend much money processing an order."Customers can order office products by traditional means -- by phone or by fax -- or through an on-line hookup with the company. In every instance, a computer checks the items in the order against the inventory in the warehouse. If the items are in inventory, as they usually are, the order goes electronically to the warehouse, indicating to employees the location of each item. Another copy moves electronically to the billing department. If any item is not in stock, the system automatically checks the on-line catalogs of two wholesalers, choosing the one with the lowest price. The wholesaler usually delivers the item to Corporate Express the same day.
In terms of sophistication, the company's customer purchasing setup pales in comparison with its inventory-control system. Corporate Express wants to fill orders from inventory. But too big a cushion in the warehouse erodes the bottom line; so, too, does too little inventory, which may require the company to fill gaps in customers' orders by paying top dollar to local wholesalers. "Every night," says Bouska, "the computers look at everything in inventory. They try to make sure we don't run out of things -- but not at any price. We stock only as deep as is cost-efficient."
To maintain an optimal level of inventory, the computer system analyzes past purchasing patterns and future demand in a fast-growing market. It must factor in a large number of variables, including seasonality of orders, discounts offered by manufacturers, and free freight granted by manufacturers as part of special promotions. "Maybe we should overstock in some cases," says Bouska, "because the free freight will more than make up for the overstocking." The computer system figures out the answer and then acts on it, perhaps ordering 10 gross of pencils for delivery to the warehouse at exactly the time inventory is projected to reach perilously low levels.
In a business of pencils and pens -- no less than in a business of selling jet aircraft, as Boeing does in the same city -- managing the details well makes all the difference. In three years, sales for the Seattle operation of Corporate Express have almost doubled, and its operating margin has gone from just above breakeven to more than 10%.* * * 
So confident is rysavy of his ability to improve the margins of the companies he buys that his pace of acquisitions is likely to quicken in the next few years. The company expects by the end of 1995 to have acquired, at a cost of $130 million, 25 companies, representing revenues of $500 million.
The pursuit of acquisitions as a growth strategy poses its own unique challenges, of course. Analysts confirm that none of Rysavy's acquisitions since 1988 have blown up in his face. The company admits that some employees of the target companies resist change and others lose their jobs, but Rysavy says that the Corporate Express model is demonstrably so much better than whatever the acquirees were doing that most people go along enthusiastically.
Analysts praise Rysavy for recruiting new talent for his management team and for delegating tasks well before he has to. Even so, control over an expanding empire has eluded many entrepreneurs. That risk seems heightened in the case of Corporate Express as it moves overseas and imposes its business model on acquisitions that are out of sight and operating in different business cultures. This year Rysavy bought a majority stake in the largest office-supply company in Australia, and he expects to make acquisitions in Europe soon.That expansion abroad comes just as competition grows more intense at home. Corporate Express and its four biggest competitors for corporate business -- Boise Cascade, Office Depot, Buhrmann-Tetterode, and Staples -- control less than 15% of the market, and all are busy buying small suppliers, which is likely to drive up acquisition prices in the future. Many hundreds of small, inefficient players will either fold or sell out over the next five years. Eventually, the big companies like Corporate Express will begin bumping into one another as they compete for the most lucrative corporate accounts. Price wars could ensue.
Despite those risks, Wall Street has been eager to finance the company's expansion. Corporate Express made its initial public offering in September 1994 and returned to the markets twice this year to make additional offerings, raising more than $500 million in all.
Rysavy owns about 3.3 million shares of the 50 million outstanding, worth roughly $70 million in early October. The financial markets clearly value his company-building expertise, but the opportunity existed for thousands of office-supply companies years before Rysavy came to the United States or even learned to speak the language.
It took Rysavy's fresh eye to see it.* * *

History[edit]
Gaiam was founded in Boulder, Colorado in 1988 by Jirka Rysavy.[2] His vision was to serve the "conscious consumer", a group subsequently named the "Cultural Creatives" by sociologist Paul Ray in 1996: educated consumers who make purchasing decisions based on their values.[3] Paul Ray now serves on Gaiam's board of directors.
In 2003, it bought a 50.1% share in its UK distributor Leisure Systems International (LSI). LSI subsequently changed its name to Gaiam Ltd.[4] In May 2008 however the UK directors of Gaiam Ltd bought back their share of the business and changed the company name again to HAB International Ltd.
In 2001, Gaiam merged with Real Goods Solar, a California-based company specializing in the production and distribution of solar power systems, other renewable energy equipment, and off-grid/sustainable living products.[5]
In 2005, Gaiam acquired the media assets of GoodTimes Entertainment Inc and Jetlag Productions which included brands such as GT Xpress, The FIRM, and Billy Blanks.[6]
Gaiam launched Real Goods in 2008 to provide "off grid living" items like solar power invertors and tankless water heaters.
In 2007, Gaiam acquired both Lime.com[7] and Zaadz.com[8] for a greater community presence. Zaadz then was renamed Gaia.com, but it was deemed unprofitable and eventually it was shut down in 2010.
In 2012, Gaiam acquired a DVD distributor from Universal Music Group Distribution (a subsidiary of Vivendi) and merged it with its home entertainment division, forming Gaiam Vivendi Entertainment.[9][10]
Gaia[edit]
In 2011, Gaiam, Inc announced the launch of Gaiam TV,[11] a streaming video subscription service offering streaming of over 5,000 films and documentaries dedicated to yoga, fitness, conscious media, personal growth and spirituality. Many of the titles in GaiamTV's library feature respected experts and individuals, such as Rodney Yee and Jillian Michaels, as well as Deepak Chopra and The Dalai Lama.
In December 2012, GaiamTV.com announced a new original show with George Noory,[12] host of radio's Coast to Coast AM. The new show covers many of the topics such as psychic vampires, privacy issues, and topics that generally fall outside of what mainstream media will cover.
Similar to other streaming video services, Gaiam TV is available on a variety of platforms including Roku, iPad, and iPhone.
On 20 November 2015, Gaiam TV announced that it has changed its name to Gaia.[13]

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in today’s conference call to discuss Gaia’s Inc. Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017. Joining us today are Gaia’s CEO, Jirka Rysavy; and CFO, Paul Tarell. Following some prepared remarks we will open the call for your questions.
Before we get started however, I would like to take a minute to read the Safe Harbor language. The following constitutes the Safe Harbor statement of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Except for historic information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements and involve numerous assumptions as well as risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, general business conditions, integration of acquisitions, timely development of new business, impact of competition and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time-to-time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company’s reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Gaia assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Gaia’s CEO, Jirka Rysavy. Please go ahead.
Jirka Rysavy
Thank you, Bethany and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter results, including the subscriber count ended again ahead of our expectation and guidance. Paid subscribers grew 58% to 247,300 from 157,000 at the end of the first quarter 2016. The growth rate increased sequentially again 6% up from 52% end of the fourth quarter and 46% during the third quarter.
The revenue in the first quarter increased 51% to $5.8 million from $3.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. Gross margin increased 440 basis points to 85.8% from 81.4%. We aim to maintain our investment discipline and kept our loss again below plan even with the faster subscriber growth.
Our relaunched site increased pitch low speed and personalized experience for each subscriber as well as increased leverage of the search engine optimization resulted in improvement in our conversion rate which is driving some of our overall performance.
Loss for the quarter was $6.2 million compared to $7.6 million in the year ago quarter. Now Paul Tarell will speak more for the first two – first quarter results. Paul?
Paul Tarell
Thanks, Jirca. Jumping right into our Q1 results, streaming revenues in the first quarter increased 61% to $5.2 million compared to the year ago quarter due to the 58% growth in paid subscribers Jirca mentioned. 
Gross profit in the first quarter increased 59% to $5 million compared to $3.1 million in the year ago quarter. Gross margin increased 440 basis points to 85.8% from 81.4%. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to leverage gain on our streaming cost due to the higher volumes and our investment in owned and produced content.
Total operating expenses in the first quarter increased to $11.8 million, which was slightly better than our expectations and are comparable to $7.2 million in the year ago quarter. The increase was due to the planned increase in selling and operating expenses associated with the announced acceleration of subscriber growth throughout 2017.
I’d like to remind our listeners that we like [ph] to expense subscriber acquisition cost in the period incurred and despite the significant life time value do not record any value of our subscribers on the balance sheet.
Net loss in the first quarter was $6.2 million or $0.41 per share, compared to a loss of $7.6 million or $0.31 per share in the year ago quarter. Our net loss for the first quarter of 2016 included approximately $3.5 million losses related to the operations of the disposed Gaiam brand business segment. The per share amounts reflect the repurchase of approximately 40% of our outstanding shares in July of 2016.

During the quarter, we’ve had approximately $2 million of accrued payables remaining from the sale of the Gaiam consumer product business and on March 31, we had $45.4 million in cash, no debt and unencumbered ownership of its 12-acre, 150,000 square foot campus.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Jirka after which we’ll open the call up for questions. Jirka?
Jirka Rysavy
Now during the quarter we have expanded our subscriber reach to several new territories, bringing our current count to 150 plus countries. We also grew our current U.S. library to approximately 7900 titles. About 80% of all the views from Gaia were gain generated by the content produced or owned by us.
At the end of the quarter, we also launched Gaia on all Comcast Xfinity platforms. As announced we also expect our subscriber growth rate to keep accelerating. After higher than expected jumps, we expect subscriber growth keep increasing to about 62% in the second quarter. The second quarter for us is the same as for example, Netflix is slow as the seasonal quarter. The gross rate of 62% would bring the paying subscriber count at the end of the second quarter to about 275,000 up from 169,500 at the end of the second quarter 2016.
In May of last year, based over the market value of our share float, Gaia was added to Russel 2000 and 3000 indexes. After that in July of last year, we have repurchased about 52% of our float in a stock buyback. Our shares price increased since then above 40%. So we expect that our current market cap will not be enough to maintain our inclusion and the rest of the indexes for the coming year. And that during the rebalancing occurring these months and some of which you kind of start to experience in the last few days about 20% of our float which is currently held by index funds will be available for sale.
We intend for subscriber growth rate to keep accelerating by about 4% to 6% per quarter to end up this 80% for 2017. The subscriber count during the first quarter grew sequentially 45,000 to 247,000 from 202,000 at the beginning of the quarter which is already well above the 80% annualized growth rate target.
As to 58% subscriber gross rate in the quarter exceeded, again our target and guidance and our cost of acquiring these customers continues to track at or below our plan. We believe that these results supports our subscriber growth expectation for remainder of the year.
And with that, I’d like to open it for the question. Operator, Bethany?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Mark Argento of Lake Street Capital Markets.
Mark Argento
Hey, Jirk. Hey Paul. Nice quarter. Just wanted to maybe drill down a little bit, looks like you’re doing a decent job on the acquisition side beating our number in terms of total sub adds in the quarter. You talk a little bit about the channels in which you’re requiring the subscribers and then some of the – I know you don’t breakout specific subscriber acquisition costs, maybe you could just talk about general trends and where they are, obviously it looks like you’ve been able to acquire and fairly cost-effectively?
Paul Tarell
So, we right now really focusing on our – what do we call seekers for kind of this time of the year. However, in January which is part of a first SKU was primarily Yoga because it's kind of new me, so it's for this quarter was about mixed. Those are pretty much. We don't really go after transformation almost at all since the channel is relatively new and we still don't have enough data, so pretty much there was kind of mixed in the first quarter.
Jirka Rysavy
In terms of the CPA trend, as you know we don't disclose those for competitive purposes, but they’ve been continuing to trend in line with the numbers that we’re targeting and actually part of their overperformance in ads is because – underspend is because we’re able to get them less than we are budgeting. We’re just continuing to tweak and refine our growth audiences as we go out and expand and we’re just not hitting an upper threshold of growth as we thought we might which is good for us for the rest of the year.

It was actually interesting that since this was probably, obviously, our fastest grow in the quarter as we keep accelerating so far the numbers as we’re getting in March to [CPA] actually get quite below what we expected to pay which we’re really pleased to see, which kind of supports the idea of the big size of the market, so it was pretty important to us and we were happy about it.
Mark Argento
Thanks guys. So the combination, I would assume of page search and Facebook and any mixed changes there or has it been fairly consistent?
Paul Tarell
I would say it’s been fairly consistent overall what we’re doing now, that was since we’ve been accelerating and we have several months, we’re just continuing to tweak and refine the mix of what we’re doing and how we’re doing it. So I’d tell you, same overall channels and mix, it's just much better insight into the customers that stick around versus just the customers that are easy to get but maybe don't retain.
Jirka Rysavy
Also as I mentioned, when we re-launched the site end of the last year, the conversion rates with personalized offering, all these other features kind of helping us to overachieve to what we thought would be our target.
Mark Argento
Got it. All right. And then in terms of the content costs, obviously you guys are going to be spending, spending a little more. Any thoughts around to kind of where you see content costs shaken out for the year?
Paul Tarell
Well. It’s kind of changing pretty much by the quarter as number of subscribers changing. But you know the numbers of the cost per hour production it's probably came from 4,000, 5,000 two years ago to you know probably right now it's running between 8,000 and 10,000 which is still kind of quite less than 10 million of Netflix. But we’re going to be pretty discipline on that stuff. The license content is probably, it’s quite cheaper than produced content.
Mark Argento
Great. And I hop back in the queue. Thanks.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Zacary Sherman of Foxhill Capital.
Zacary Sherman
Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. I think in the previous quarters you did break out what your subscriber acquisition costs were. I may have missed it, if you said that previously, could you give that for this quarter? 
Paul Tarell
Yes. Zacary, this is Paul. It is a required annual disclosure on our GAAP, which is why we’ve done it in Q4, it’s not something that we plan on providing quarterly updates on. But for this quarter I will give you the breakout here just, because you’ve asked so it is about 6.3 million in terms of the spend for Q1 in customer acquisition.
Zacary Sherman
Great. That’s very helpful.
Paul Tarell
And just a little bit of context there. Some of that spend was related to what we were doing with the Gaia on Xfinity platform launch. So it may not all be directly correlated to the direct business.
Zacary Sherman
Great. That’s all I got. Thanks a lot.
Operator
And at this time, this concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rysavy for closing remarks.
Jirka Rysavy
Well, thank you. And thanks everyone for joining. And we look forward to speak with you when we report our second quarter which will be in early August. Thank you very much.
Operator

Jirka Rysavy
Thank you, Melissa. And good afternoon everyone. During the third quarter, we completed the sale of our branded consumer product business and recognized $114 million pre-tax gain. In addition to the second quarter $12.8 million sale of our 51% interest in Natural Habitat, which we acquired for a $0.6 million. Other gains were offset by our NOL.
We have used the majority of the proceeds from the disposition to conduct a share purchase tender offer and acquired 9,637,000 shares of our shock at 840,000 vested stock options at $7.75 per share. The remaining proceeds will be used to fund the continuing growth and development of our business, as well as general corporate purposes.
Our third quarter results, including the subscriber count and it's slightly ahead of our expectation and guidance this paid subscribers growing 46% to 180,000 from 123,000 at the end of 3Q of 2015. Gross margin improved higher 70 basis points to 84.3% from 82.6% in the 3Q of 2015. Net loss from continuing operation for the third quarter was 200,000 or $0.01 per share compared to a loss of 700,000 or $0.03 per share in a year ago.
Now, will let Paul Tarell our CFO to speak more about third quarter.
Paul Tarell
Thanks, Jirka. The reported results we issued in today's press release are from continuing operations, excluding the results of the Gaiam branded business which we sold on July 1st and our interest in Natural Habitat which we sold on May 5th. The assets, liabilities, in the financial results from these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Now, moving on to our Q3 results. Streaming revenue in the third quarter increased 35% to $3.8 million compared to the year ago quarter due to continue strong subscriber growth which was slightly offset by the decline in revenues generated from non-streaming, including our legacy DVD subscription club.
Total subscribers at the end of the third quarter grew 46% to 180,000 compared to a 123,000 in for the same quarter of 2015. Growth profit in the third quarter increased 30% to $3.8 million compared to $2.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin increased a 170 basis points to 84.3% from 82.6% in the third quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to leverage gained on streaming cost due to higher volumes and higher revenues.

Total expenses in the third quarter increased to $8 million compared to $3.5 million in the year ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to spending $2.9 million on customer acquisition and branding during the current quarter compared to $0.6 million in the year ago quarter. The remaining increase was due to higher payroll related expenses due to an increase in headcount to support our realized and projected growth. The cost of business separation activities and the cost of transition services which ended on September 30th.
Loss from operations in the third quarter was $4.2 million compared to $0.6 million in the year ago quarter driven by primarily by the increased expenses previously mentioned. With the conclusion of the sale of the Gaiam branded business during the quarter combined with the gain from Natural Habitat in the second quarter, we realize a total gain of a 124.8 million. We utilized historical net operating loss carry forward to offset a majority of this gain, resulting in 14.1 million of tax expense related to this divestitures.
This tax expense was further offset by losses generated from continuing operation which resulted in a tax benefit of $4 million in the third quarter of 2016 for continuing operations. We find to pay approximately $2 million in remaining cash taxes in December 1, we'll make our estimated tax payment for the year. Net loss from continuing operations in the third quarter was 200,000 or $0.01 per share compared to a loss of 2 million or $0.08 per share in the year ago quarter.
Income from discontinued operations including the gain on the sale of the Gaiam branded business, net of taxes and transaction expenses contributed to generating net income of 100.4 million or $6.64 per share compared to a loss of 8.8 million or 36% spent per share in the third quarter of last year. At September 30th, 2016, we had $62.5 million in cash, we continue to carry no debt, which resulted in a current ratio of over 5:1. We also own our fully leased 150,000 square foot office headquarters in Boulder, Colorado.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Jirka for some additional remarks after which we'll open the call up for questions. Jirka?
Jirka Rysavy
Yes. Last week we also launched our new gaia.com site with a new personalization engine and dramatic improvements in our with the delivery. The new technology is designed to optimize for algorithms of search engines, which currently represent a significant part of our customer physician efforts. The new features include our latest the geo-fencing technology and also flexible to support our multilingual international efforts.
We also invested in retention technology and several new apps, is the new android app already launched, a new iOS, Roku and smart TV apps launching later this month. We have expanded our subscriber reach to several new countries bringing detouring current count to a 130. We also meaningfully edit to our content, growing our current US library to approximately 75,00 titles.
Because of the exclusivity of our content and the niche offering, Gaia's position as complementary service to large entertainment SVOD players like Netflix. 71% of Gaia's subscribers have now also subscription to Netflix. 80% of the views on Gaia are generated by content produced by us. We recently renew our shelf registration with SEC, it was set to expire in October.
We have had this shelf registration in place continually since 2007, while we have no current plans to utilize the shelf, to renewals consistent with our history of keeping the filing current and available for use if strategic opportunities arise. And I would like to reiterate that we do not have any current plan to use it.
Our recent stock purchase representing about 40% for our shares outstanding was in addition to previous 10 years when company was also a net buyer of its stock. At end of the quarter, we have $62.5 million cash on our campus and carry no debt. As announced previously, we expect our subscriber growth to start accelerating and reaching about 200,000 by the end of the year which would be 50% subscriber growth.

We have elected to expand the subscriber acquisition costs upfront and do not capitalize the value of our subscribers on balance sheet despite of the significant lifetime value. Therefore no value of these customers is reflected on our GAAP financial statement.
And because of this, all these exciting potentials and opportunities, I have return after 8 years as a CEO and I do truly enjoy the job. And with that, I like to open the call for questions. Operator, Melissa?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mark Argento with Lake Street Capital Markets.
Mark Argento
Hi, good afternoon, guys.
Jirka Rysavy
Hi, Mark.
Paul Tarell
Hello.
Mark Argento
Hey. Just some, maybe could just help us think through a little bit how ramp in terms of the customer acquisition spending. Think you ended the quarter at about a 180,000 and then you got a 200,000. Have you guys started to crank up the customer acquisition spend. Are you seeing the trends there you like in terms of the customer acquisition costs, so you can drive a positive ROI on those new subs?
Paul Tarell
Yes. I mean, even with the increase, I mean, this third quarter it was a meaningful increase of the spending. It's doing, it's going really well but the spending wasn’t really different per customer. And as a we go to fourth quarter, we expect similar thing. We don’t spend more per customer, we're just spending more overall dollars to acquire more customers. And we don’t expand because for acquisition increasing.
Actually, what we saw generally over last few months that especially on the kind of transformation in secret side of the business that the cost per acquisition is slightly below what we actually budgeted it.
Mark Argento
In terms of the overall seasonality, I know the I would say kind of fitness wellness is still a decent part of your mix. And that historically has favored seasonality, some in Q4 but obviously in Q1. You anticipate seeing similar type of seasonality with the subscriber growth?
Jirka Rysavy
Yes. I think right now in the fourth quarter, it's come more from the transformation side as generally come yoga and that wellness for kind of new me, I'm sure will be done many like every, I don’t think that will change, it will be always generally ahead with already on that. And as we go to end of the first quarter, I think we'll kind of reverse back to the transformation side.
But, generally this half of the year is better for us historically than the other parts. It should follow kind of Netflix's acquisition seasonality. It's pretty much same as they see.
Mark Argento
All right. And then in terms of the balance sheet and I know the stock have been pretty soft for the last month or so. Do you have a share buyback authorized at this point, I know you obviously get this on a bunch of stock back or kind of a bunch of stock. But just given kind of the choppiness with the tape right now, would you guys be amenable they take continue to use your balance sheet opportunistically on the buyback?
Jirka Rysavy
Well, we talk about several times why this is definitely becomes where it is, what's the pricing and stuff, we put a buyback on time ago. We talked about it. We already want to put all the numbers because basically today is the first time we put in actual number of the balance sheet and the tax phase and all that stuff.
So, we would definitely we're going to have information up there before we consider the buyback. But as we said, we just bought 40% and we previously for last 10 years we're net buyers. So, I don’t think that finally we'll change the direction. Right now, we have the lot of cash.
Mark Argento
Okay, all right. Congrats on the sale on the new business model. Thanks.

Jirka Rysavy
Thank you, Mark.
Operator
Thank you. We'll next go to Peter Rabover with Artko Capital.
Peter Rabover
Hi guys, can you hear me?
Jirka Rysavy
Yes, do.
Peter Rabover
Hey, got a couple of questions. So, looks like you guys went $6.5 million on customer acquisitions but what was the growth at of the customers?
Jirka Rysavy
We don’t provide those numbers. Even on really kind of grow, we say numbers Netflix get, because then you kind of get to how you come with the retention and the -- for example, the issues like for us, if you lose the customers and get them back six months or as a new customer for Netflix with the existing customers, is a confused issue if you start to talk about net, net and gross customers. So, I think we would say this net add on the cost. We got a full pretty much in Netflix disclosures.
Paul Tarell
And Peter, I just want to clarify my scripted comments, we said 2.9 million on customer acquisition, that is for to make sure you had the right number there.
Peter Rabover
Okay, yes, sorry, I apologize.
Paul Tarell
Okay.
Peter Rabover
And then on the last quarter you guys entered 170,000, is that right?
Paul Tarell
Yes.
Peter Rabover
Okay. And then on the balance sheet, so it looks like you guys have a little bit more cash, it's 62.5, and on that investments and other 10 million. Could you guys clarify what that is?
Paul Tarell
Yes. We made some investment in there's a kind of couple, mostly it's been retention technologies investment, and invested a little bit on a private company which were interesting, technology for retention. We also invested our new apps. And as we said, we kind of launched some of the apps now and we're going to do a little more. And so, that’s pretty much all of that's up there.
Peter Rabover
Is all the escrow cash been released from the transaction?
Paul Tarell
Yes, we received all the escrow cash though it was a small amount of receivables left from the buyer that we received in October but not meaningful amount, but all the cash have now been received.
Jirka Rysavy
It was about 800,000 what we received in October. And we mentioned the tax is revised, we'll have to pay over next quarter when there wasn’t -- pay is about 2 million.
Peter Rabover
Okay, great. And just last question. Can you guys comment what the cash burn was this quarter, was that EBIT, the kind of approximate number on that?
Paul Tarell
The Q will be filed tomorrow that will have that in there.
Peter Rabover
Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. We'll next go to Zacary Sherman with Foxhill Capital Partners.
Zacary Sherman
Hi, guys.
Jirka Rysavy
Hello.
Zacary Sherman
I was just wondering if you could break out with the onetime expenses in the quarter were from the business separation in the transition services and what you see going forward in the next couple of quarters if there's anything remaining. Thanks.
Paul Tarell
Sure. I'll answer those in a reverse order. So, the ongoing stuff is de minimis at this point. Being able to break it out specifically that that harder to do for this quarter because it's not as cut and dry as it was in the first half of the year because it was transitioning and separating the businesses but also doing all the setup of the new business going forward as that smaller or new public company. So, I can't put a specific number on it but I would say it's somewhere in that $500,000 to $600,000 range would probably be a safe number. But those are not going to be continuing in into Q4.
Jirka Rysavy
And those are kind of what we -- the problem with the counting GAAP statement, there are statements what I allow to put in discontinue line and the head staff would even it's related to discontinue operation is not, because let's say we have our previous general counsel and CFO which stay on the payroll too, like end of this September and they are still staying bonus is some staff and so how you count for it. It is all pretty significant all the severance system stuff.

So, why they not kind of one time effective as they will be for us because they will not continue but they will allow them to -- they even they don’t allow to be classified a discontinue operation. So, this is what Paul saying, so difficult to put actually a number on it, it have crossing the GAAP statements. But I think, next quarter, the number I think will be pretty clean. There is worth so nothing would continue so over this, except we still would have.
But we still have some severance is little bit but they are actually all accrued, I think, right?
Paul Tarell
Yes.
Jirka Rysavy
So, next quarter should be pretty clean.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll next go to Douglas Coburn with Venture Capital.
Jirka Rysavy
Hello?
Operator
Wait just a moment please.
Douglas Coburn
Can you hear me?
Operator
Okay. Mr. Coburn, go ahead.
Douglas Coburn
Thank you. Hi, this is Douglas here, how are you?
Jirka Rysavy
Good. How are you doing, good?
Douglas Coburn
Doing good, thanks. Thank you for taking my question here. I just have two questions. The first is if you could walk me through how you think about deploying cash through prior customers in a profitable way. Do you have a minimum return threshold?
Jirka Rysavy
Yes, of course. For us, you can think it simple our balance sheet right now is basically cash. And our building and so we can call it 80 million plus our library which we carry a much lower number because we expand whatever with the deal. And then we have we basically turn cash into new customers. We do not capitalize the customer, so that's not on the balance sheet, so you have to use your judgement how many hire 8000 customers are.
They are obviously people like current subscribers, they typically kind of well you step about 500 but it's more to market value if you kind of to look last time value, true last time values maybe a half of that. But we basically the goal for us when we acquire new customer is to spend maximum 50% of the lifetime value. We actually currently spend quite less than that, but in average we'll be always less than a half because some of them we get a 10%, I mean, 20%, but we never spend more than 50%.
So, basically the idea is take $1 of cash and turn it to $2 or $3 customer value. So that's pretty much the guidance.
Douglas Coburn
Got it. And then I think you haven’t disclosed the average lifetime of the customer. But I guess the overall return would vary depending on whether that value is realized in a few years or in the longer term?
Jirka Rysavy
Well, I mean, it roughly when I said it's about half, so she would have taken 250 and take -- we do to lifetime value based on our cash contribution margin which is currently about 89% 90%. If we don’t do the calculate it in a revenue, so we actually taking true value of the customer and then you go pretty much from the revenue. And the average revenue we charge $9.95 a month, but people buy annual, it would be less because the annual people pay about a $100.
So, that's how you can pretty much figure out the average. There is little more complications because there are some different way if you go through Apple of not, or if the use are different but in because we would pay up or like 30% first year and 15% second year. So, but they would have additional marketing expenses per se. So, the calculation is little more difficult but roughly the retention is kind of depends customer segment very small then like 2.5x. So, we would have to talk specific customer segments to make sense.
But average you can get from the overall guidance or lifetime value.
Douglas Coburn
Got you, thank you. And along those same lines, in terms of how you expect that customer acquisition cost to change over time and potentially increase with more competition. If you think I had in five years based on the numbers that you projected, when you're above 1 million subscribers, how do you expect competition to manifest? Where do you think it's coming from and how would it impact your acquisition costs?

Jirka Rysavy
Well, I mean, our -- the competition for what we're doing, it's not coming from what you say competitors. It's definitely competitors for when you bid on certain names or works. Right? But they don’t necessarily come from our competing segment. They might be somebody who sell some widgets. But so, it's not really per se our competitor where we see the pressure from. But we don’t expect to go over 50% lifetime value anywhere during the process.
Actually our expectation, it is because we see we're getting more efficient in buying same as Netflix. So, I think the trend that you tend to actually be better what you do obviously as we kind of grow faster that that additions few might be more people you're paying its toward 50% than we pay today, because today our average in some of the department, some of the channels are 60%, 50%, 60% of the 50%. But we will see probably getting closer to 50% as we go as the numbers get bigger.
But overall, saying we got same amount of customers today and then, I think we actually be more efficient than we are today.
Douglas Coburn
Right. But do you expect another company or somebody to copy basically what you're doing and come up with their media library and start addressing some of those same topics that you're currently selling. Do you think that is something that will likely happen?
Jirka Rysavy
Look, we don't know about anybody today. There's nobody in our horizon, but I think your guess is as good as ours, it should happen or not.
Douglas Coburn
Okay. And do you have a certain, I guess, plan to deal with such competition?
Jirka Rysavy
It is hard to plan on something before it exists where we know our competition will come from. They, it can manifest various way. But today, on our main channel, it's really question, it's a channel different like in Yoga, there is currently 12 people in the US doing it.
Douglas Coburn
Right.
Jirka Rysavy
Nobody really success or significant. But there is lot of people doing it for 10+ years. On the what we call Truth Seekers side, then it's like much more difficult because when we originally envision it in now four five years to go, we outline like 3000 titles, make sure are published in the United State or anywhere like in English over a 50 years. And we went aggressively after them with a team and we today are probably 80% of those titles.
So, for somebody coming to that space would be quite difficult, it's possible because they can produce the content but produce maybe a half a 1000 titles, it takes some time. So, if it's somebody will be pocket will be much cheaper for them to buy us and try to compete on from this get go. And if it's somebody who's doesn't have enough financial, they're just going to have a hard time.
Douglas Coburn
Got it. So, you basically in those specific nature, you control the market by earning the majority of the relevant content?
Jirka Rysavy
That's kind of the plan. So, if we go to the new space, we need to kind of dominate a space that's kind of the idea. It's pretty much exclusive content. Also, the content is for us over 90% exclusive and its and its increasing because we're producing more, we're getting better, the license is about a little long. So, it's very stable business at a way. So, I don’t think that this would particularly quite sure we will be proud.
The dealer issue, I think we would more worry about somebody from waiting there for some other reason. Is one of reason, we have a guy and we have 40% of US market share and fitness by -- this we kind of finale them effectively was this statistic and it's called video scan. And in the videos. We decided not to be in a fitness, so we pretty much took our viewing outside fitness from about 15% to less than a 1%. And in long term, probably, we don’t have any fitness, because we would see that long term, somebody like Nike might decide to create a content and give it free to sell the product and we will not be caught in situation like that.

So, for us the position niche is really part of strategy. So, it's very important for us to that these kind of niches we can play significant role or just not be there. Because we have lot of niches we can go to.
Douglas Coburn
Got it. That makes sense. And the content that you're currently creating, is it mostly for Yoga or that you'd be costing pretty much across the board?
Jirka Rysavy
Made across the board, Yoga is not. Probably from usage on this side, Yoga is maybe 20%.
Douglas Coburn
Okay. So, the content you create might be under areas such as transformation?
Jirka Rysavy
Yes.
Douglas Coburn
Got it. That's all, thank you very much. I appreciate the insight.
Jirka Rysavy
Thank you.
Operator
