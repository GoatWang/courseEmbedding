Professional career[edit]
2007[edit]




John Isner at the 2007 US Open


Isner began his professional career in earnest in the summer of 2007. With a world ranking of no. 839, he needed wildcard entries into the main draws of every tournament, even at the Futures level.[5]
He won his first tournament of the summer, the USA F14 Futures, [6]beating the top three seeds along the way. Then, after first-round losses in a Challenger-level and an ATP-level tournament, he beat five top-300 players and three seeds to win the Lexington Challenger in July and improve his ranking to no. 416 after just one month.
At the following week's tournament at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., a late withdrawal freed up a wildcard spot, which was given to Isner at the last minute.[7] Isner took full advantage of his good fortune, recording his first wins over top-100 players. He won third-set tiebreakers on five consecutive days, beating no. 73 Tim Henman, no. 47 Benjamin Becker, no. 189 qualifier Wayne Odesnik, no. 12 Tommy Haas, and no. 54 Gaël Monfils, to reach the final, where he fell to fellow American Andy Roddick. His week raised his ranking to no. 193 in the world after six weeks on the pro tour.
Isner's Washington success earned him wildcard entries into three more ATP tournaments: the Masters Series event in Cincinnati a week later, New Haven, and the US Open. He lost in the first round in Cincinnati to quarterfinalist no. 15 David Ferrer. The following week in New Haven, he beat no. 49 Becker a second time, before falling to Ferrer for the second week in a row.
In his US Open début, he defeated the 26th-seeded player, former quarterfinalist Jarkko Nieminen, firing 34 aces along the way. He proceeded to win his second-round match against Rik de Voest, before losing in the third round to top seed and eventual champion Roger Federer. Isner was one of only two players to take a set from Federer in the championship. His US Open performance improved his ranking to no. 144.
After the US Open, Isner continued to play exclusively in North America and finished the year ranked no. 107. That year, Isner was added to the United States Davis Cup team as a practice partner.[8]
2008[edit]
Isner's no. 106 ranking in November 2007 was just good enough to get him direct entry into his first Australian Open, after several players ranked above him dropped out.[9] He was defeated in the first round of the 2008 Australian Open by veteran Fabrice Santoro of France. Teamed with Croat Ivo Karlović (2 cm (1 in) taller than Isner, Karlović is currently the tallest player on the ATP tour), Isner also lost in the first round of doubles.[10]
Isner broke into the top 100 at no. 93 in February with a quarterfinal appearance at the ATP event in San Jose, beating no. 90 Florent Serra and no. 26 Tommy Haas. He maintained a top-100 ranking in the first three months of the year, beating six players in the top 100, while playing exclusively in ATP-level events. Isner played in his first French Open and Wimbledon, losing in the first round of each. He also played in the US Open, where he lost in the first round. He ended the year ranked no. 144 in the world.
2009: Reaching the Top 40[edit]
Isner qualified for the singles draw of the 2009 Heineken Open in Auckland, after winning three consecutive three-set matches in qualifying. His final match saw him bounce back from a 0–3 deficit in the third set to eventually beat Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci in a tie-breaker. In the main draw, Isner beat Albert Montañés and countryman Robby Ginepri, before ultimately exiting with a loss in the quarterfinals.
Isner received a wildcard entry into the 2009 Australian Open, after winning the United States Tennis Association's wildcard tournament, beating Donald Young and Jesse Levine along the way.[11] Despite serving 39 aces against his first-round opponent, Slovakia's Dominik Hrbatý, he lost in four sets. Isner began working with a new coach, Craig Boynton, who had coached former world no. 1 Jim Courier in the 1990s, in March 2009.[12]
At the 2009 Indian Wells tournament, Isner pulled off a major upset by defeating ninth seed Gaël Monfils. This was Isner's first win over a top-10 player, after four previous defeats. He then went on to defeat former world no. 1 Marat Safin, before losing to world no. 6 Juan Martín del Potro in the fourth round.
In April 2009 at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas, at River Oaks Country Club, Isner made it as far as the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by fellow American Wayne Odesnik.[13] Isner qualified for the French Open, but had to withdraw after being diagnosed with mononucleosis, which caused him to miss Wimbledon as well.[14]
In August 2009, he defeated world no. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and world no. 18 Tomáš Berdych en route to the semifinals of the ATP World Tour 500 event in Washington, before losing to world no. 5 Andy Roddick. This performance brought him to a career-high ranking of no. 55 and a special exemption into the Masters 1000 Series event in Montreal, where he defeated Jesse Levine, before losing to Mikhail Youzhny. He earned a wildcard into the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati, where he defeated world no. 21 Tommy Haas, before losing to world no. 35 Jérémy Chardy in the second round.




Isner's forehand return to Verdasco at the 2009 US Open


Unseeded and ranked no. 55 in the world entering the US Open, Isner defeated world no. 29 Victor Hănescu in the first round, which was his first win in a Grand Slam tournament since the 2007 US Open, ending a streak of six consecutive defeats. He then advanced to the third round, where he defeated world no. 5 and fellow American Andy Roddick in five sets for his first victory over Roddick, his first victory in a five-set match, and the first time he advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament. He was then defeated in the fourth round by world no. 10 Fernando Verdasco in four sets. His US Open performance brought his ranking to a career-high no. 39.
After playing in Vienna, Basel, and the Paris Masters, Isner finished the year at a career-high no. 34 in the world. He has credited his work with Boynton for helping him get back on track following his disappointing 2008 season.[12]
His progress was acknowledged by his peers, as he was voted the ATP Most Improved Player for 2009,[15] becoming the tenth American to win the award, and the first since Andre Agassi in 1998.
2010: First ATP title, longest match in history[edit]




Isner hits a forehand.


Isner began the year at the 2010 Heineken Open in Auckland. Unseeded, he reached his second career ATP final and first since Washington in 2007. In the final, he saved a championship point to defeat 2001 Australian Open finalist Arnaud Clément.[16][17] The victory in Auckland was Isner's first ATP tour title; after the victory he donated $5,000 of his winnings to aid rescue action for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[18]
The victory catapulted Isner into the top 30 for the first time and also allowed him to surpass Sam Querrey to become the second highest-ranked American for the first time, behind only Andy Roddick.[12] Isner said he intended to finish the year in the top 20,[18] and given his ascendency in the world rankings combined with the absence of Roddick and James Blake for the 2010 Davis Cup season, it became increasingly likely that Isner would qualify to play singles for the US Davis Cup team for the first time in his career.[12]
After Gilles Simon withdrew, Isner became the final seed for the 2010 Australian Open.[19] In the first round, he defeated world no. 49 Andreas Seppi for his first victory at the Australian Open and his first victory at a Grand Slam other than the US Open. He then advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 4 and eventual finalist Andy Murray.
After the Australian Open, Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe announced that Isner and Querrey would be first and second singles on the 2010 United States Davis Cup team for the team's 2010 Davis Cup World Group first-round match in Serbia on indoor clay in March 2010; Isner described the selection as "a dream come true".[20]
Isner next entered the 2010 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis. Seeded sixth, he made it to the finals, before losing to Sam Querrey. In the doubles event, Isner teamed up with Querrey to win the tournament, defeating British-Australian pair of Ross Hutchins and Jordan Kerr.
Prior to the Davis Cup tie, Isner competed at the 2010 Abierto Mexicano Telcel Championships, an ATP World Tour 500 series event on clay, where he was the fifth seed. He lost in the first round to Simon Greul. Despite the loss, Isner following the tournament moved into the top 20 for the first time.
Isner appeared at the 2010 Davis Cup first round, where USA was up against Serbia. In his two singles matches, he faced Serbia's team of world no. 2 Novak Djokovic and world no. 35 Viktor Troicki. He lost the first singles match against Viktor Troicki, but bounced back by winning the doubles match with Bob Bryan, as a replacement for food-poisoned Mike Bryan. In his second singles match, he lost to Novak Djokovic, which enabled Serbia to defeat the United States.
At the 2010 BNP Paribas Open Masters 1000 in Indian Wells, he was seeded 15th and advanced to the fourth round, before losing to world no. 2 and defending champion Rafael Nadal.
Afterwards, he appeared in the second master series tournament of the season, the 2010 Sony Ericsson Open Masters 1000 in Miami as the 17th seed. He advanced to the third round, before losing to 12th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero.
Isner began the clay-court season with an opening-round loss to world no. 89 Xavier Malisse at the U.S. Men's Claycourt Championship, followed by a round of 32 showing at his first-ever Rome Masters, where he defeated Horacio Zeballos, before losing to Thomaz Bellucci. However, he teamed with Querrey to reach the doubles final in Rome, before losing to Bob and Mike Bryan; his doubles performance raised his doubles ranking to the top 30 for the first time.
His next tournament was the 2010 Serbian Open, where he was the second seed behind defending champion, tournament host, and world no. 2 Djokovic. Isner advanced to the first clay-court final of his career, third final of the year, and fourth final of his career. In the final, he lost to Querrey, despite having a match point; this was the second consecutive final Isner lost to Querrey after serving for the championship. However, Isner's finals performance improved his ranking to a career-high no. 19.
Isner's next tournament was his debut appearance at the Madrid Masters. Seeded thirteenth, he advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 3 and eventual champion Nadal.
Isner then played in the 2010 French Open; his ranking assured his first direct seed into a Grand Slam event. Seeded 17th, he defeated Andrey Golubev in the first round for his first singles victory at the French Open. He advanced to the third round, before losing to no. 15 seed and eventual semifinalist Tomáš Berdych. In doubles, he and Querrey were the 12th seeds, but withdrew prior to the start of the tournament after Querrey's first-round loss in singles.
Despite being ranked no. 19 in the world entering the Wimbledon, Isner was seeded 24th by the tournament committee due to his lack of experience on grass, but was moved up to 23rd following the withdrawal of Radek Štěpánek. In the first round, Isner played Nicolas Mahut in the longest match in tennis history, prevailing 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.[21] However, fatigued and having little time to recover his energy, Isner was beaten by Thiemo de Bakker in the second round, 0–6, 3–6, 2–6, having served no aces. He also pulled out of the doubles, where he and Querrey had been 12th seeds.[22] Despite having been eliminated in the second round, Isner's total of 113 aces[23] were more than any other player throughout the championship. His Wimbledon performance brought his ranking to a career-high no. 18 in the world.
Isner's next tournament was the 2010 Atlanta Tennis Championships, where he played doubles with James Blake and reached the semifinals. In singles, Isner was second seed and made it to his fourth final of the year, before losing to Mardy Fish, which dropped his career record in finals to 1–4 (0–4 against Americans).
Isner next competed at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, the ATP World Tour 500 series event in Washington, D.C. and site of his breakthrough performance in 2007. Isner was also to compete in the doubles with Sam Querrey, but withdrew due to shoulder concerns. Seeded fifth in singles, Isner made it to the round of 16, before losing to Xavier Malisse.
Isner next played in the Cincinnati Masters, where he was unseeded. After defeating Łukasz Kubot in the first round, he faced 2002 Wimbledon finalist and 2005 Tennis Masters Cup champion David Nalbandian, but was forced to retire up a break at 5–4 in the first set after injuring his right ankle. Although Isner was found to have suffered ligament damage to the ankle, he chose not to withdraw from the US Open singles tournament.[24]
At the 2010 US Open, Isner was 18th seed and defeated Frederico Gil in the first round. After the match he revealed that although the initial diagnosis was a right ankle ligament tear, a second opinion revealed that the damage was a strain and not a tear, and he declared his ankle 90% healed.[25][26] He then advanced to the third round, before losing to 12th seed and 2006 US Open semifinalist Mikhail Youzhny. The loss dropped Isner out of the top 20, and from the no. 2 to the no. 4 ranked American player. Due to his ankle injury, he chose not to compete in doubles.
Following the US Open, Isner participated with Mardy Fish and Sam Querrey in the Davis Cup tie against Colombia, winning the doubles match with Fish as his partner. The US won the match 3–1 to remain in the 2011 Davis Cup world group.[27] Isner was next granted a wildcard to participate in the 2010 China Open, his first time competing in Beijing.

Isner next took a last-minute wild card to participate in the 2011 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships, replacing compatriot and defending champion Mardy Fish, who was chosen to play in the Davis Cup for the United States during that weekend. Isner was the top seed and defeated Karol Beck, 2001 Australian Open finalist Arnaud Clément, Alex Bogomolov, Jr., and Tobias Kamke without dropping a set, to reach his first career grass-court final. In the final, he defeated Olivier Rochus to become the first top seed in 35 years to win the event.

At the 2014 Wimbledon Championships, Isner reached the third round, where he lost to Feliciano López in four sets with three tiebreaks.
In Newport, Rhode Island, John made it to the quarterfinals, where he lost to Jack Sock. However, he got revenge in the semifinals in Atlanta a couple of weeks later and went on to win the tournament, his ninth, with a win over Dudi Sela.
At the US Open, Isner reached the third round, where he lost to Philipp Kohlschreiber for the third consecutive year.
Isner hired Justin Gimelstob as his new coach at the end of the 2014 season.[39]

2015: Tenth ATP title and new highest year-end finish[edit]
Isner started the season slowly, making the third round of the Australian Open and having only a quarterfinal showing in Memphis before making it into the semifinals in Miami with three wins in a row defeating Dimitrov, Raonic, and Nishikori. He lost to Djokovic in the semifinals.
He lost to Djokovic again in straight sets in Indian Wells in the third round after winning qualifier Jürgen Melzer in the second round. In Monte Carlo, he lost to Rafael Nadal in the third round. He made the quarterfinals in Madrid, where he lost to Tomáš Berdych. In Nice, he made the semifinals, losing to Dominic Thiem.

At Roland Garros, he lost to Jérémy Chardy in the second round. On grass, he made the quarterfinals at Queen's Club and the third round at Wimbledon to Marin Cilic in his third-round match at Wimbledon. In this match, Isner played another marathon, eventually losing to the then-world no. 9 by 10-12 in the fifth set after two days of play.
Isner lost in the first round in Newport to eventual champion Rajeev Ram. He successfully defended his title in Atlanta in July to win his 10th Tour title and third in a row in the tournament, defeating Marcos Baghdatis in the final in straight sets. The following week, he reached the final of the 500 tournament in Washington DC, losing in the final to Kei Nishikori. He also reached the quarterfinals of the Rogers Cup in Montréal, losing in three tiebeaks to Jérémy Chardy. However, the next week in Cincinnati, he went out in the first round against Sam Querrey. He skipped Winston-Salem, his home tournament, the week before the US Open.
At the US Open, Isner advanced to the fourth round, losing to Federer in straight sets, but nonetheless marked his best Grand Slam result of the year. He reached the third round in Shanghai, before losing to Andy Murray in three sets and made his third quarterfinal Masters appearance of the year in Paris, after beating Federer in three sets. Isner finished the year at his best year-end ranking to date, at world no. 11.
2016: Third Masters final and seventh consecutive top-20 finish[edit]
Isner started his season in Auckland and reached the quarterfinals, losing to eventual champion, Roberto Bautista Agut.[40] At Australian Open, he reached the fourth round for the first time since 2010 defeating Spaniards Marcel Granollers and Feliciano López before losing in straights sets to David Ferrer.[41] Instead of playing the US spring hardcourt tournaments, Isner decided to play two clay court tournaments in South America, losing his first match in both to Dusan Lajovic in Argentina and Guido Pella in Brazil.[42] In the first round of Davis Cup, Isner defeated Bernard Tomic and Sam Groth to help upset Australia 3-1 and move the United States into the quarterfinals against Croatia.[43]
Isner reached the fourth round at BNP Paribas Open for the third year in a row before losing to Kei Nishikori, and he was then upset early in Miami Open by Tim Smyczek.[44] Despite missing most of the clay season, only playing U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships and Geneva Open, Isner reached the fourth round of the French Open for only the second time in his career, losing to eventual finalist Andy Murray in straight sets.[45] Isner's season continued with early losses in both grass tournaments he played, losing to Gilles Müller at Aegon Championships and losing a marathon match to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at Wimbledon.[46]
Isner started the US Open Series with a disappointing loss in the second round of the Rogers Cup to Ryan Harrison.[47] Isner rebounded by reaching his first final of the season and his fourth consecutive final at the Atlanta Open, losing in straight sets to Nick Kyrgios.[48] Isner skipped the Summer Olympics due to a lack of ranking points and prize money, electing to focus on the summer hardcourt tournaments of the US Open Series.[49] After Isner lost in straight sets in the second round to Milos Raonic, and Steve Johnson reached the quarterfinals in Cincinnati, Isner lost the title of the top-ranked American man for the first time in three years.[50] Although he regained it in the following week, Johnson took it back over following the US Open, after Isner was unable to defend his fourth round points, losing in the third round to Kyle Edmund in four sets.[51]
Isner teamed up with Jack Sock to win his second Masters doubles title and fourth overall doubles title at the Shanghai Masters.[52] Unseeded at the final regular tournament of the season, Isner would prevail against seeded players David Ferrer and Marin Cilic to reach his third Masters final and second final of the season at the Paris Masters.[53] His semi-final victory allowed Isner to again finish the year as the No. 1 American for the fifth consecutive year and inside the Top 20 for the seventh consecutive season. In the final, Isner lost to the newly crowned world number 1 Andy Murray, thus leaving him titleless in singles for the first time since 2009.[54]
2017[edit]
Isner reached quarterfinals in Auckland, Memphis, and Houston. He reached the semifinals in Rome at the Italian Open, where he was defeated by eventual champion Alexander Zverev. At the French Open, Isner came off to a strong start, beating Jordan Thompson and Paolo Lorenzi in the first and second rounds, respectively. However, he fell in the third round to Karen Khachanov in 4 sets.
Isner competed at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, where he defeated qualifier Taylor Fritz in the first round before losing to Dudi Sela in 5 sets the following match. At the Dell Technologies Hall of Fame Open in Newport, Isner defeated qualifier Matthew Ebden 6-3, 7-6(4) in the final to win his first singles title of the year.
Longest match in history[edit]
Main article: Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships
At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, Isner (ranked 23), faced qualifier Nicolas Mahut in the first round. Isner won the match 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.
The final set alone was longer than the previous longest match.
In the match, Isner set the record for most aces in a match, breaking Ivo Karlović's record of 78; Mahut passed the old mark as well.[55] Isner set a new record of 113 aces, ahead of the 103 aces served by Mahut.
The first four sets were played on June 22. At 21:13 BST on June 23 the match was suspended due to darkness for a second day at 59–59 in the fifth set. The match resumed on June 24, at 15:30 BST,[56] starting the third day of the match. Overall, the match lasted eleven hours and five minutes. Isner also set the record for most games won in a Wimbledon match with 92.
The match brought Isner a measure of fame, particularly in the United States. He had guest appearances on "Good Morning America" and the "Late Show with David Letterman", and threw the ceremonial first pitch at a New York Yankees game in Yankee Stadium.[57][58] He and Mahut also won the 2010 ESPY Award for Best Record-Breaking Performance in sport.[59]

Playing style and equipment[edit]
Isner has an extremely powerful and consistent serve, thanks in part to his 6-ft 10-in height which makes him the third tallest player on tour behind Ivo Karlović and Reilly Opelka. Commentators[who?] have also praised his composure; in five consecutive third-set tiebreaker wins in Washington, he delivered huge serves when it mattered most.[60] Isner also has a very powerful forehand, which he uses in tandem with his serve. Isner will often go for one-two points: a big serve followed up by a big forehand. He is also known to back up his serves with approaches to the net, though he does not strictly serve-and-volley. Isner's movement around the court is hampered by his body and he is hurt by players that move him around the court. Isner's fitness has improved considerably throughout the years, as he displayed during his win in the longest tennis match ever at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut.
As of January 2012, Isner is sponsored by Lacoste and Prince for his attire and rackets respectively.[61][62] His attire carried through most of 2015. He switched his attire to FILA in 2016 at the Australian Open.
Coaches[edit]
Isner's first coach was Craig Boynton, who worked with him from 2007 to 2012, and helped develop his style of play. Isner and Boynton split over reportedly mutual agreement. Isner then hired Mike Sell, who helped him to significant success, such as defeating Roger Federer, David Nalbandian, and Novak Djokovic. During his time with Sell, Isner's ranking stayed around No.10 in the world. After parting from Sell in 2014, Isner teamed with Justin Gimelstob and worked with him until April 2016. With Gimelstob, Isner's ranking stayed around 10, until 2016, where he dropped to 17.
Personal life[edit]
Isner started playing tennis seriously at age 11. He played competitively for Westside Swim and Tennis Club in Greensboro, North Carolina, throughout his childhood. He is a graduate of Walter Hines Page Senior High School, in Greensboro,[63] and the University of Georgia, where he majored in speech communication. He currently resides in Tampa, Florida, where he trains at the Saddlebrook Academy alongside other American tennis pros such as James Blake and Mardy Fish.
Isner is a supporter of the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League and the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League.[64]

In 2013, he became the 18th player to serve more than 5,000 aces on the ATP World Tour. He currently has 5th-most aces in the history of ATP, having served more than 8,800 aces.[4] At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, he played the longest professional tennis match in history, defeating Nicolas Mahut in a total of 11 hours and 5 minutes of play over the course of three days.

Professional career[edit]
2007[edit]




John Isner at the 2007 US Open


Isner began his professional career in earnest in the summer of 2007. With a world ranking of no. 839, he needed wildcard entries into the main draws of every tournament, even at the Futures level.[5]
He won his first tournament of the summer, the USA F14 Futures, [6]beating the top three seeds along the way. Then, after first-round losses in a Challenger-level and an ATP-level tournament, he beat five top-300 players and three seeds to win the Lexington Challenger in July and improve his ranking to no. 416 after just one month.
At the following week's tournament at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., a late withdrawal freed up a wildcard spot, which was given to Isner at the last minute.[7] Isner took full advantage of his good fortune, recording his first wins over top-100 players. He won third-set tiebreakers on five consecutive days, beating no. 73 Tim Henman, no. 47 Benjamin Becker, no. 189 qualifier Wayne Odesnik, no. 12 Tommy Haas, and no. 54 Gaël Monfils, to reach the final, where he fell to fellow American Andy Roddick. His week raised his ranking to no. 193 in the world after six weeks on the pro tour.
Isner's Washington success earned him wildcard entries into three more ATP tournaments: the Masters Series event in Cincinnati a week later, New Haven, and the US Open. He lost in the first round in Cincinnati to quarterfinalist no. 15 David Ferrer. The following week in New Haven, he beat no. 49 Becker a second time, before falling to Ferrer for the second week in a row.
In his US Open début, he defeated the 26th-seeded player, former quarterfinalist Jarkko Nieminen, firing 34 aces along the way. He proceeded to win his second-round match against Rik de Voest, before losing in the third round to top seed and eventual champion Roger Federer. Isner was one of only two players to take a set from Federer in the championship. His US Open performance improved his ranking to no. 144.
After the US Open, Isner continued to play exclusively in North America and finished the year ranked no. 107. That year, Isner was added to the United States Davis Cup team as a practice partner.[8]
2008[edit]
Isner's no. 106 ranking in November 2007 was just good enough to get him direct entry into his first Australian Open, after several players ranked above him dropped out.[9] He was defeated in the first round of the 2008 Australian Open by veteran Fabrice Santoro of France. Teamed with Croat Ivo Karlović (2 cm (1 in) taller than Isner, Karlović is currently the tallest player on the ATP tour), Isner also lost in the first round of doubles.[10]
Isner broke into the top 100 at no. 93 in February with a quarterfinal appearance at the ATP event in San Jose, beating no. 90 Florent Serra and no. 26 Tommy Haas. He maintained a top-100 ranking in the first three months of the year, beating six players in the top 100, while playing exclusively in ATP-level events. Isner played in his first French Open and Wimbledon, losing in the first round of each. He also played in the US Open, where he lost in the first round. He ended the year ranked no. 144 in the world.
2009: Reaching the Top 40[edit]
Isner qualified for the singles draw of the 2009 Heineken Open in Auckland, after winning three consecutive three-set matches in qualifying. His final match saw him bounce back from a 0–3 deficit in the third set to eventually beat Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci in a tie-breaker. In the main draw, Isner beat Albert Montañés and countryman Robby Ginepri, before ultimately exiting with a loss in the quarterfinals.
Isner received a wildcard entry into the 2009 Australian Open, after winning the United States Tennis Association's wildcard tournament, beating Donald Young and Jesse Levine along the way.[11] Despite serving 39 aces against his first-round opponent, Slovakia's Dominik Hrbatý, he lost in four sets. Isner began working with a new coach, Craig Boynton, who had coached former world no. 1 Jim Courier in the 1990s, in March 2009.[12]
At the 2009 Indian Wells tournament, Isner pulled off a major upset by defeating ninth seed Gaël Monfils. This was Isner's first win over a top-10 player, after four previous defeats. He then went on to defeat former world no. 1 Marat Safin, before losing to world no. 6 Juan Martín del Potro in the fourth round.
In April 2009 at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas, at River Oaks Country Club, Isner made it as far as the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by fellow American Wayne Odesnik.[13] Isner qualified for the French Open, but had to withdraw after being diagnosed with mononucleosis, which caused him to miss Wimbledon as well.[14]
In August 2009, he defeated world no. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and world no. 18 Tomáš Berdych en route to the semifinals of the ATP World Tour 500 event in Washington, before losing to world no. 5 Andy Roddick. This performance brought him to a career-high ranking of no. 55 and a special exemption into the Masters 1000 Series event in Montreal, where he defeated Jesse Levine, before losing to Mikhail Youzhny. He earned a wildcard into the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati, where he defeated world no. 21 Tommy Haas, before losing to world no. 35 Jérémy Chardy in the second round.




Isner's forehand return to Verdasco at the 2009 US Open


Unseeded and ranked no. 55 in the world entering the US Open, Isner defeated world no. 29 Victor Hănescu in the first round, which was his first win in a Grand Slam tournament since the 2007 US Open, ending a streak of six consecutive defeats. He then advanced to the third round, where he defeated world no. 5 and fellow American Andy Roddick in five sets for his first victory over Roddick, his first victory in a five-set match, and the first time he advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament. He was then defeated in the fourth round by world no. 10 Fernando Verdasco in four sets. His US Open performance brought his ranking to a career-high no. 39.
After playing in Vienna, Basel, and the Paris Masters, Isner finished the year at a career-high no. 34 in the world. He has credited his work with Boynton for helping him get back on track following his disappointing 2008 season.[12]
His progress was acknowledged by his peers, as he was voted the ATP Most Improved Player for 2009,[15] becoming the tenth American to win the award, and the first since Andre Agassi in 1998.
2010: First ATP title, longest match in history[edit]




Isner hits a forehand.


Isner began the year at the 2010 Heineken Open in Auckland. Unseeded, he reached his second career ATP final and first since Washington in 2007. In the final, he saved a championship point to defeat 2001 Australian Open finalist Arnaud Clément.[16][17] The victory in Auckland was Isner's first ATP tour title; after the victory he donated $5,000 of his winnings to aid rescue action for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[18]
The victory catapulted Isner into the top 30 for the first time and also allowed him to surpass Sam Querrey to become the second highest-ranked American for the first time, behind only Andy Roddick.[12] Isner said he intended to finish the year in the top 20,[18] and given his ascendency in the world rankings combined with the absence of Roddick and James Blake for the 2010 Davis Cup season, it became increasingly likely that Isner would qualify to play singles for the US Davis Cup team for the first time in his career.[12]
After Gilles Simon withdrew, Isner became the final seed for the 2010 Australian Open.[19] In the first round, he defeated world no. 49 Andreas Seppi for his first victory at the Australian Open and his first victory at a Grand Slam other than the US Open. He then advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 4 and eventual finalist Andy Murray.
After the Australian Open, Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe announced that Isner and Querrey would be first and second singles on the 2010 United States Davis Cup team for the team's 2010 Davis Cup World Group first-round match in Serbia on indoor clay in March 2010; Isner described the selection as "a dream come true".[20]
Isner next entered the 2010 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis. Seeded sixth, he made it to the finals, before losing to Sam Querrey. In the doubles event, Isner teamed up with Querrey to win the tournament, defeating British-Australian pair of Ross Hutchins and Jordan Kerr.
Prior to the Davis Cup tie, Isner competed at the 2010 Abierto Mexicano Telcel Championships, an ATP World Tour 500 series event on clay, where he was the fifth seed. He lost in the first round to Simon Greul. Despite the loss, Isner following the tournament moved into the top 20 for the first time.
Isner appeared at the 2010 Davis Cup first round, where USA was up against Serbia. In his two singles matches, he faced Serbia's team of world no. 2 Novak Djokovic and world no. 35 Viktor Troicki. He lost the first singles match against Viktor Troicki, but bounced back by winning the doubles match with Bob Bryan, as a replacement for food-poisoned Mike Bryan. In his second singles match, he lost to Novak Djokovic, which enabled Serbia to defeat the United States.
At the 2010 BNP Paribas Open Masters 1000 in Indian Wells, he was seeded 15th and advanced to the fourth round, before losing to world no. 2 and defending champion Rafael Nadal.
Afterwards, he appeared in the second master series tournament of the season, the 2010 Sony Ericsson Open Masters 1000 in Miami as the 17th seed. He advanced to the third round, before losing to 12th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero.
Isner began the clay-court season with an opening-round loss to world no. 89 Xavier Malisse at the U.S. Men's Claycourt Championship, followed by a round of 32 showing at his first-ever Rome Masters, where he defeated Horacio Zeballos, before losing to Thomaz Bellucci. However, he teamed with Querrey to reach the doubles final in Rome, before losing to Bob and Mike Bryan; his doubles performance raised his doubles ranking to the top 30 for the first time.
His next tournament was the 2010 Serbian Open, where he was the second seed behind defending champion, tournament host, and world no. 2 Djokovic. Isner advanced to the first clay-court final of his career, third final of the year, and fourth final of his career. In the final, he lost to Querrey, despite having a match point; this was the second consecutive final Isner lost to Querrey after serving for the championship. However, Isner's finals performance improved his ranking to a career-high no. 19.
Isner's next tournament was his debut appearance at the Madrid Masters. Seeded thirteenth, he advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 3 and eventual champion Nadal.
Isner then played in the 2010 French Open; his ranking assured his first direct seed into a Grand Slam event. Seeded 17th, he defeated Andrey Golubev in the first round for his first singles victory at the French Open. He advanced to the third round, before losing to no. 15 seed and eventual semifinalist Tomáš Berdych. In doubles, he and Querrey were the 12th seeds, but withdrew prior to the start of the tournament after Querrey's first-round loss in singles.
Despite being ranked no. 19 in the world entering the Wimbledon, Isner was seeded 24th by the tournament committee due to his lack of experience on grass, but was moved up to 23rd following the withdrawal of Radek Štěpánek. In the first round, Isner played Nicolas Mahut in the longest match in tennis history, prevailing 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.[21] However, fatigued and having little time to recover his energy, Isner was beaten by Thiemo de Bakker in the second round, 0–6, 3–6, 2–6, having served no aces. He also pulled out of the doubles, where he and Querrey had been 12th seeds.[22] Despite having been eliminated in the second round, Isner's total of 113 aces[23] were more than any other player throughout the championship. His Wimbledon performance brought his ranking to a career-high no. 18 in the world.
Isner's next tournament was the 2010 Atlanta Tennis Championships, where he played doubles with James Blake and reached the semifinals. In singles, Isner was second seed and made it to his fourth final of the year, before losing to Mardy Fish, which dropped his career record in finals to 1–4 (0–4 against Americans).
Isner next competed at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, the ATP World Tour 500 series event in Washington, D.C. and site of his breakthrough performance in 2007. Isner was also to compete in the doubles with Sam Querrey, but withdrew due to shoulder concerns. Seeded fifth in singles, Isner made it to the round of 16, before losing to Xavier Malisse.
Isner next played in the Cincinnati Masters, where he was unseeded. After defeating Łukasz Kubot in the first round, he faced 2002 Wimbledon finalist and 2005 Tennis Masters Cup champion David Nalbandian, but was forced to retire up a break at 5–4 in the first set after injuring his right ankle. Although Isner was found to have suffered ligament damage to the ankle, he chose not to withdraw from the US Open singles tournament.[24]
At the 2010 US Open, Isner was 18th seed and defeated Frederico Gil in the first round. After the match he revealed that although the initial diagnosis was a right ankle ligament tear, a second opinion revealed that the damage was a strain and not a tear, and he declared his ankle 90% healed.[25][26] He then advanced to the third round, before losing to 12th seed and 2006 US Open semifinalist Mikhail Youzhny. The loss dropped Isner out of the top 20, and from the no. 2 to the no. 4 ranked American player. Due to his ankle injury, he chose not to compete in doubles.
Following the US Open, Isner participated with Mardy Fish and Sam Querrey in the Davis Cup tie against Colombia, winning the doubles match with Fish as his partner. The US won the match 3–1 to remain in the 2011 Davis Cup world group.[27] Isner was next granted a wildcard to participate in the 2010 China Open, his first time competing in Beijing. In doubles, he teamed with Querrey, losing in the first round to Bob and Mike Bryan. In singles, Isner was unseeded, but made it to the semifinals, before losing to world no. 2 and defending champion Novak Djokovic. Isner next competed in the Shanghai Masters, where he was unseeded, and made it to the second round, before losing to world no. 3 and reigning Australian Open champion Roger Federer in their first meeting since the 2007 US Open.
2011: Second and third ATP titles[edit]
Isner began the year by teaming with Bethanie Mattek-Sands to win the mixed doubles Hopman Cup Final for the US, defeating Belgium's Justine Henin and Ruben Bemelmans.
Following his win in Perth, Isner returned to Auckland to defend his ATP title at the 2011 Heineken Open. After a bye in his first round, the third seed faced Dutch world no. 52[28] Robin Haase. Isner defeated Haase[29] to go through to the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by David Nalbandian in straight sets.[30]
Isner next played in the 2011 Australian Open He entered the tournament seeded 20th[31] and received a tough draw, including Radek Štěpánek, Marin Čilić, and Rafael Nadal. Isner came up against French world no. 69 Florent Serra, whom he easily defeated. Isner faced Radek Štěpánek in the second round. After losing the first set, Isner rallied to defeat Stepanek to progress into the third round. In the third round, Isner faced fellow top-20 player Marin Čilić. The match went to five sets, with Cilic emerging as the eventual winner.
At the 2011 French Open, Isner was drawn against top seed and defending champion Rafael Nadal. Isner took a two-sets-to-one lead against Nadal, who had never played a five-set match at Roland Garros before. Nadal went on to win the title.[32] In the 2011 Wimbledon men's singles draw, Isner was paired against Mahut in the first round, a rematch of the world's longest match from the previous year's tournament. Isner won in straight sets. However, he lost in the second round to the 16th seed Nicolás Almagro in four sets, dropping his 2011 record to 11–14.
Isner next took a last-minute wild card to participate in the 2011 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships, replacing compatriot and defending champion Mardy Fish, who was chosen to play in the Davis Cup for the United States during that weekend.

The next day, Isner once again recovered from two sets down to level the match, this time against Tommy Haas, saving a record 12 match points in the fourth set. However, Isner then let a lead slip and failed to convert a match point of his own and Haas eventually won the fifth set.[38]

One week later, he won the 2014 Heineken Open, defeating Lu Yen-hsun in the final in two tiebreak sets. At the 2014 Australian Open, he faced Martin Kližan in the first round, but after losing the first two sets, he ultimately retired due to an ankle injury.

On grass, he made the quarterfinals at Queen's Club and the third round at Wimbledon to Marin Cilic in his third-round match at Wimbledon. In this match, Isner played another marathon, eventually losing to the then-world no. 9 by 10-12 in the fifth set after two days of play.
Isner lost in the first round in Newport to eventual champion Rajeev Ram. He successfully defended his title in Atlanta in July to win his 10th Tour title and third in a row in the tournament, defeating Marcos Baghdatis in the final in straight sets. The following week, he reached the final of the 500 tournament in Washington DC, losing in the final to Kei Nishikori.

Isner finished the year at his best year-end ranking to date, at world no. 11.
2016: Third Masters final and seventh consecutive top-20 finish[edit]
Isner started his season in Auckland and reached the quarterfinals, losing to eventual champion, Roberto Bautista Agut.[40] At Australian Open, he reached the fourth round for the first time since 2010 defeating Spaniards Marcel Granollers and Feliciano López before losing in straights sets to David Ferrer.[41] Instead of playing the US spring hardcourt tournaments, Isner decided to play two clay court tournaments in South America, losing his first match in both to Dusan Lajovic in Argentina and Guido Pella in Brazil.[42] In the first round of Davis Cup, Isner defeated Bernard Tomic and Sam Groth to help upset Australia 3-1 and move the United States into the quarterfinals against Croatia.[43]
Isner reached the fourth round at BNP Paribas Open for the third year in a row before losing to Kei Nishikori, and he was then upset early in Miami Open by Tim Smyczek.[44] Despite missing most of the clay season, only playing U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships and Geneva Open, Isner reached the fourth round of the French Open for only the second time in his career, losing to eventual finalist Andy Murray in straight sets.[45] Isner's season continued with early losses in both grass tournaments he played, losing to Gilles Müller at Aegon Championships and losing a marathon match to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at Wimbledon.[46]
Isner started the US Open Series with a disappointing loss in the second round of the Rogers Cup to Ryan Harrison.[47] Isner rebounded by reaching his first final of the season and his fourth consecutive final at the Atlanta Open, losing in straight sets to Nick Kyrgios.[48] Isner skipped the Summer Olympics due to a lack of ranking points and prize money, electing to focus on the summer hardcourt tournaments of the US Open Series.[49] After Isner lost in straight sets in the second round to Milos Raonic, and Steve Johnson reached the quarterfinals in Cincinnati, Isner lost the title of the top-ranked American man for the first time in three years.[50] Although he regained it in the following week, Johnson took it back over following the US Open, after Isner was unable to defend his fourth round points, losing in the third round to Kyle Edmund in four sets.[51]
Isner teamed up with Jack Sock to win his second Masters doubles title and fourth overall doubles title at the Shanghai Masters.[52] Unseeded at the final regular tournament of the season, Isner would prevail against seeded players David Ferrer and Marin Cilic to reach his third Masters final and second final of the season at the Paris Masters.[53] His semi-final victory allowed Isner to again finish the year as the No. 1 American for the fifth consecutive year and inside the Top 20 for the seventh consecutive season. In the final, Isner lost to the newly crowned world number 1 Andy Murray, thus leaving him titleless in singles for the first time since 2009.[54]
2017[edit]
Isner reached quarterfinals in Auckland, Memphis, and Houston. He reached the semifinals in Rome at the Italian Open, where he was defeated by eventual champion Alexander Zverev.

At the Dell Technologies Hall of Fame Open in Newport, Isner defeated qualifier Matthew Ebden 6-3, 7-6(4) in the final to win his first singles title of the year.
Longest match in history[edit]
Main article: Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships
At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, Isner (ranked 23), faced qualifier Nicolas Mahut in the first round. Isner won the match 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.
The final set alone was longer than the previous longest match.
In the match, Isner set the record for most aces in a match, breaking Ivo Karlović's record of 78; Mahut passed the old mark as well.[55] Isner set a new record of 113 aces, ahead of the 103 aces served by Mahut.
The first four sets were played on June 22. At 21:13 BST on June 23 the match was suspended due to darkness for a second day at 59–59 in the fifth set. The match resumed on June 24, at 15:30 BST,[56] starting the third day of the match. Overall, the match lasted eleven hours and five minutes. Isner also set the record for most games won in a Wimbledon match with 92.
The match brought Isner a measure of fame, particularly in the United States. He had guest appearances on "Good Morning America" and the "Late Show with David Letterman", and threw the ceremonial first pitch at a New York Yankees game in Yankee Stadium.[57][58] He and Mahut also won the 2010 ESPY Award for Best Record-Breaking Performance in sport.[59]

Playing style and equipment[edit]
Isner has an extremely powerful and consistent serve, thanks in part to his 6-ft 10-in height which makes him the third tallest player on tour behind Ivo Karlović and Reilly Opelka. Commentators[who?] have also praised his composure; in five consecutive third-set tiebreaker wins in Washington, he delivered huge serves when it mattered most.[60] Isner also has a very powerful forehand, which he uses in tandem with his serve. Isner will often go for one-two points: a big serve followed up by a big forehand. He is also known to back up his serves with approaches to the net, though he does not strictly serve-and-volley. Isner's movement around the court is hampered by his body and he is hurt by players that move him around the court. Isner's fitness has improved considerably throughout the years, as he displayed during his win in the longest tennis match ever at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut.
As of January 2012, Isner is sponsored by Lacoste and Prince for his attire and rackets respectively.[61][62] His attire carried through most of 2015. He switched his attire to FILA in 2016 at the Australian Open.
Coaches[edit]
Isner's first coach was Craig Boynton, who worked with him from 2007 to 2012, and helped develop his style of play. Isner and Boynton split over reportedly mutual agreement. Isner then hired Mike Sell, who helped him to significant success, such as defeating Roger Federer, David Nalbandian, and Novak Djokovic. During his time with Sell, Isner's ranking stayed around No.10 in the world. After parting from Sell in 2014, Isner teamed with Justin Gimelstob and worked with him until April 2016. With Gimelstob, Isner's ranking stayed around 10, until 2016, where he dropped to 17.
Personal life[edit]
Isner started playing tennis seriously at age 11. He played competitively for Westside Swim and Tennis Club in Greensboro, North Carolina, throughout his childhood. He is a graduate of Walter Hines Page Senior High School, in Greensboro,[63] and the University of Georgia, where he majored in speech communication. He currently resides in Tampa, Florida, where he trains at the Saddlebrook Academy alongside other American tennis pros such as James Blake and Mardy Fish.
Isner is a supporter of the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League and the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League.[64]

John Robert Isner (born April 26, 1985) is an American professional tennis player. Considered one of the best servers of the ATP World Tour, Isner achieved his career-high singles ranking of world No. 9 in April 2012. In 2013, he became the 18th player to serve more than 5,000 aces on the ATP World Tour. He currently has 5th-most aces in the history of ATP, having served more than 8,800 aces.[4] At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, he played the longest professional tennis match in history, defeating Nicolas Mahut in a total of 11 hours and 5 minutes of play over the course of three days. He also played the then 10th-longest singles match, a 5-hour 41-minute encounter in the second round of the 2012 French Open.

Professional career[edit]
2007[edit]




John Isner at the 2007 US Open


Isner began his professional career in earnest in the summer of 2007. With a world ranking of no. 839, he needed wildcard entries into the main draws of every tournament, even at the Futures level.[5]
He won his first tournament of the summer, the USA F14 Futures, [6]beating the top three seeds along the way. Then, after first-round losses in a Challenger-level and an ATP-level tournament, he beat five top-300 players and three seeds to win the Lexington Challenger in July and improve his ranking to no. 416 after just one month.
At the following week's tournament at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., a late withdrawal freed up a wildcard spot, which was given to Isner at the last minute.[7] Isner took full advantage of his good fortune, recording his first wins over top-100 players. He won third-set tiebreakers on five consecutive days, beating no. 73 Tim Henman, no. 47 Benjamin Becker, no. 189 qualifier Wayne Odesnik, no. 12 Tommy Haas, and no. 54 Gaël Monfils, to reach the final, where he fell to fellow American Andy Roddick. His week raised his ranking to no. 193 in the world after six weeks on the pro tour.
Isner's Washington success earned him wildcard entries into three more ATP tournaments: the Masters Series event in Cincinnati a week later, New Haven, and the US Open. He lost in the first round in Cincinnati to quarterfinalist no. 15 David Ferrer. The following week in New Haven, he beat no. 49 Becker a second time, before falling to Ferrer for the second week in a row.
In his US Open début, he defeated the 26th-seeded player, former quarterfinalist Jarkko Nieminen, firing 34 aces along the way. He proceeded to win his second-round match against Rik de Voest, before losing in the third round to top seed and eventual champion Roger Federer. Isner was one of only two players to take a set from Federer in the championship. His US Open performance improved his ranking to no. 144.
After the US Open, Isner continued to play exclusively in North America and finished the year ranked no. 107. That year, Isner was added to the United States Davis Cup team as a practice partner.[8]
2008[edit]
Isner's no. 106 ranking in November 2007 was just good enough to get him direct entry into his first Australian Open, after several players ranked above him dropped out.[9] He was defeated in the first round of the 2008 Australian Open by veteran Fabrice Santoro of France. Teamed with Croat Ivo Karlović (2 cm (1 in) taller than Isner, Karlović is currently the tallest player on the ATP tour), Isner also lost in the first round of doubles.[10]
Isner broke into the top 100 at no. 93 in February with a quarterfinal appearance at the ATP event in San Jose, beating no. 90 Florent Serra and no. 26 Tommy Haas. He maintained a top-100 ranking in the first three months of the year, beating six players in the top 100, while playing exclusively in ATP-level events. Isner played in his first French Open and Wimbledon, losing in the first round of each. He also played in the US Open, where he lost in the first round. He ended the year ranked no. 144 in the world.
2009: Reaching the Top 40[edit]
Isner qualified for the singles draw of the 2009 Heineken Open in Auckland, after winning three consecutive three-set matches in qualifying. His final match saw him bounce back from a 0–3 deficit in the third set to eventually beat Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci in a tie-breaker. In the main draw, Isner beat Albert Montañés and countryman Robby Ginepri, before ultimately exiting with a loss in the quarterfinals.
Isner received a wildcard entry into the 2009 Australian Open, after winning the United States Tennis Association's wildcard tournament, beating Donald Young and Jesse Levine along the way.[11] Despite serving 39 aces against his first-round opponent, Slovakia's Dominik Hrbatý, he lost in four sets. Isner began working with a new coach, Craig Boynton, who had coached former world no. 1 Jim Courier in the 1990s, in March 2009.[12]
At the 2009 Indian Wells tournament, Isner pulled off a major upset by defeating ninth seed Gaël Monfils. This was Isner's first win over a top-10 player, after four previous defeats. He then went on to defeat former world no. 1 Marat Safin, before losing to world no. 6 Juan Martín del Potro in the fourth round.
In April 2009 at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas, at River Oaks Country Club, Isner made it as far as the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by fellow American Wayne Odesnik.[13] Isner qualified for the French Open, but had to withdraw after being diagnosed with mononucleosis, which caused him to miss Wimbledon as well.[14]
In August 2009, he defeated world no. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and world no. 18 Tomáš Berdych en route to the semifinals of the ATP World Tour 500 event in Washington, before losing to world no. 5 Andy Roddick. This performance brought him to a career-high ranking of no. 55 and a special exemption into the Masters 1000 Series event in Montreal, where he defeated Jesse Levine, before losing to Mikhail Youzhny. He earned a wildcard into the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati, where he defeated world no. 21 Tommy Haas, before losing to world no. 35 Jérémy Chardy in the second round.




Isner's forehand return to Verdasco at the 2009 US Open


Unseeded and ranked no. 55 in the world entering the US Open, Isner defeated world no. 29 Victor Hănescu in the first round, which was his first win in a Grand Slam tournament since the 2007 US Open, ending a streak of six consecutive defeats. He then advanced to the third round, where he defeated world no. 5 and fellow American Andy Roddick in five sets for his first victory over Roddick, his first victory in a five-set match, and the first time he advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament. He was then defeated in the fourth round by world no. 10 Fernando Verdasco in four sets. His US Open performance brought his ranking to a career-high no. 39.
After playing in Vienna, Basel, and the Paris Masters, Isner finished the year at a career-high no. 34 in the world. He has credited his work with Boynton for helping him get back on track following his disappointing 2008 season.[12]
His progress was acknowledged by his peers, as he was voted the ATP Most Improved Player for 2009,[15] becoming the tenth American to win the award, and the first since Andre Agassi in 1998.
2010: First ATP title, longest match in history[edit]




Isner hits a forehand.


Isner began the year at the 2010 Heineken Open in Auckland. Unseeded, he reached his second career ATP final and first since Washington in 2007. In the final, he saved a championship point to defeat 2001 Australian Open finalist Arnaud Clément.[16][17] The victory in Auckland was Isner's first ATP tour title; after the victory he donated $5,000 of his winnings to aid rescue action for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[18]
The victory catapulted Isner into the top 30 for the first time and also allowed him to surpass Sam Querrey to become the second highest-ranked American for the first time, behind only Andy Roddick.[12] Isner said he intended to finish the year in the top 20,[18] and given his ascendency in the world rankings combined with the absence of Roddick and James Blake for the 2010 Davis Cup season, it became increasingly likely that Isner would qualify to play singles for the US Davis Cup team for the first time in his career.[12]
After Gilles Simon withdrew, Isner became the final seed for the 2010 Australian Open.[19] In the first round, he defeated world no. 49 Andreas Seppi for his first victory at the Australian Open and his first victory at a Grand Slam other than the US Open. He then advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 4 and eventual finalist Andy Murray.
After the Australian Open, Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe announced that Isner and Querrey would be first and second singles on the 2010 United States Davis Cup team for the team's 2010 Davis Cup World Group first-round match in Serbia on indoor clay in March 2010; Isner described the selection as "a dream come true".[20]
Isner next entered the 2010 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis. Seeded sixth, he made it to the finals, before losing to Sam Querrey. In the doubles event, Isner teamed up with Querrey to win the tournament, defeating British-Australian pair of Ross Hutchins and Jordan Kerr.
Prior to the Davis Cup tie, Isner competed at the 2010 Abierto Mexicano Telcel Championships, an ATP World Tour 500 series event on clay, where he was the fifth seed.

At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, Isner (ranked 23), faced qualifier Nicolas Mahut in the first round. Isner won the match 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.
The final set alone was longer than the previous longest match.
In the match, Isner set the record for most aces in a match, breaking Ivo Karlović's record of 78; Mahut passed the old mark as well.[55] Isner set a new record of 113 aces, ahead of the 103 aces served by Mahut.
The first four sets were played on June 22. At 21:13 BST on June 23 the match was suspended due to darkness for a second day at 59–59 in the fifth set. The match resumed on June 24, at 15:30 BST,[56] starting the third day of the match. Overall, the match lasted eleven hours and five minutes.

Playing style and equipment[edit]
Isner has an extremely powerful and consistent serve, thanks in part to his 6-ft 10-in height which makes him the third tallest player on tour behind Ivo Karlović and Reilly Opelka. Commentators[who?] have also praised his composure; in five consecutive third-set tiebreaker wins in Washington, he delivered huge serves when it mattered most.[60] Isner also has a very powerful forehand, which he uses in tandem with his serve. Isner will often go for one-two points: a big serve followed up by a big forehand. He is also known to back up his serves with approaches to the net, though he does not strictly serve-and-volley. Isner's movement around the court is hampered by his body and he is hurt by players that move him around the court. Isner's fitness has improved considerably throughout the years, as he displayed during his win in the longest tennis match ever at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut.
As of January 2012, Isner is sponsored by Lacoste and Prince for his attire and rackets respectively.[61][62] His attire carried through most of 2015. He switched his attire to FILA in 2016 at the Australian Open.
Coaches[edit]
Isner's first coach was Craig Boynton, who worked with him from 2007 to 2012, and helped develop his style of play. Isner and Boynton split over reportedly mutual agreement. Isner then hired Mike Sell, who helped him to significant success, such as defeating Roger Federer, David Nalbandian, and Novak Djokovic. During his time with Sell, Isner's ranking stayed around No.10 in the world. After parting from Sell in 2014, Isner teamed with Justin Gimelstob and worked with him until April 2016. With Gimelstob, Isner's ranking stayed around 10, until 2016, where he dropped to 17.
Personal life[edit]
Isner started playing tennis seriously at age 11. He played competitively for Westside Swim and Tennis Club in Greensboro, North Carolina, throughout his childhood. He is a graduate of Walter Hines Page Senior High School, in Greensboro,[63] and the University of Georgia, where he majored in speech communication. He currently resides in Tampa, Florida, where he trains at the Saddlebrook Academy alongside other American tennis pros such as James Blake and Mardy Fish.
Isner is a supporter of the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League and the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League.[64]

In 2015, Isner played once again in the Hopman Cup as a last-minute entry, replacing the injured Jack Sock and partnered with Serena Williams. They reached the mixed doubles final and lost in two sets to Agnieszka Radwańska and Jerzy Janowicz of Poland.

John Robert Isner (born April 26, 1985) is an American professional tennis player. Considered one of the best servers of the ATP World Tour, Isner achieved his career-high singles ranking of world No. 9 in April 2012. In 2013, he became the 18th player to serve more than 5,000 aces on the ATP World Tour. He currently has 5th-most aces in the history of ATP, having served more than 8,800 aces.[4] At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, he played the longest professional tennis match in history, defeating Nicolas Mahut in a total of 11 hours and 5 minutes of play over the course of three days. He also played the then 10th-longest singles match, a 5-hour 41-minute encounter in the second round of the 2012 French Open.

Professional career[edit]
2007[edit]




John Isner at the 2007 US Open


Isner began his professional career in earnest in the summer of 2007. With a world ranking of no. 839, he needed wildcard entries into the main draws of every tournament, even at the Futures level.[5]
He won his first tournament of the summer, the USA F14 Futures, [6]beating the top three seeds along the way. Then, after first-round losses in a Challenger-level and an ATP-level tournament, he beat five top-300 players and three seeds to win the Lexington Challenger in July and improve his ranking to no. 416 after just one month.
At the following week's tournament at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., a late withdrawal freed up a wildcard spot, which was given to Isner at the last minute.[7] Isner took full advantage of his good fortune, recording his first wins over top-100 players.

Teamed with Croat Ivo Karlović (2 cm (1 in) taller than Isner, Karlović is currently the tallest player on the ATP tour), Isner also lost in the first round of doubles.[10]

The victory catapulted Isner into the top 30 for the first time and also allowed him to surpass Sam Querrey to become the second highest-ranked American for the first time, behind only Andy Roddick.[12] Isner said he intended to finish the year in the top 20,[18] and given his ascendency in the world rankings combined with the absence of Roddick and James Blake for the 2010 Davis Cup season, it became increasingly likely that Isner would qualify to play singles for the US Davis Cup team for the first time in his career.[12]
After Gilles Simon withdrew, Isner became the final seed for the 2010 Australian Open.[19] In the first round, he defeated world no. 49 Andreas Seppi for his first victory at the Australian Open and his first victory at a Grand Slam other than the US Open. He then advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 4 and eventual finalist Andy Murray.

The match resumed on June 24, at 15:30 BST,[56] starting the third day of the match. Overall, the match lasted eleven hours and five minutes. Isner also set the record for most games won in a Wimbledon match with 92.
The match brought Isner a measure of fame, particularly in the United States. He had guest appearances on "Good Morning America" and the "Late Show with David Letterman", and threw the ceremonial first pitch at a New York Yankees game in Yankee Stadium.[57][58] He and Mahut also won the 2010 ESPY Award for Best Record-Breaking Performance in sport.[59]

Playing style and equipment[edit]
Isner has an extremely powerful and consistent serve, thanks in part to his 6-ft 10-in height which makes him the third tallest player on tour behind Ivo Karlović and Reilly Opelka. Commentators[who?] have also praised his composure; in five consecutive third-set tiebreaker wins in Washington, he delivered huge serves when it mattered most.[60] Isner also has a very powerful forehand, which he uses in tandem with his serve. Isner will often go for one-two points: a big serve followed up by a big forehand. He is also known to back up his serves with approaches to the net, though he does not strictly serve-and-volley. Isner's movement around the court is hampered by his body and he is hurt by players that move him around the court. Isner's fitness has improved considerably throughout the years, as he displayed during his win in the longest tennis match ever at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut.
As of January 2012, Isner is sponsored by Lacoste and Prince for his attire and rackets respectively.[61][62] His attire carried through most of 2015. He switched his attire to FILA in 2016 at the Australian Open.
Coaches[edit]
Isner's first coach was Craig Boynton, who worked with him from 2007 to 2012, and helped develop his style of play. Isner and Boynton split over reportedly mutual agreement. Isner then hired Mike Sell, who helped him to significant success, such as defeating Roger Federer, David Nalbandian, and Novak Djokovic. During his time with Sell, Isner's ranking stayed around No.10 in the world. After parting from Sell in 2014, Isner teamed with Justin Gimelstob and worked with him until April 2016. With Gimelstob, Isner's ranking stayed around 10, until 2016, where he dropped to 17.
Personal life[edit]
Isner started playing tennis seriously at age 11. He played competitively for Westside Swim and Tennis Club in Greensboro, North Carolina, throughout his childhood. He is a graduate of Walter Hines Page Senior High School, in Greensboro,[63] and the University of Georgia, where he majored in speech communication. He currently resides in Tampa, Florida, where he trains at the Saddlebrook Academy alongside other American tennis pros such as James Blake and Mardy Fish.
Isner is a supporter of the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League and the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League.[64]

Professional career[edit]
2007[edit]




John Isner at the 2007 US Open


Isner began his professional career in earnest in the summer of 2007. With a world ranking of no. 839, he needed wildcard entries into the main draws of every tournament, even at the Futures level.[5]
He won his first tournament of the summer, the USA F14 Futures, [6]beating the top three seeds along the way. Then, after first-round losses in a Challenger-level and an ATP-level tournament, he beat five top-300 players and three seeds to win the Lexington Challenger in July and improve his ranking to no. 416 after just one month.
At the following week's tournament at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., a late withdrawal freed up a wildcard spot, which was given to Isner at the last minute.[7] Isner took full advantage of his good fortune, recording his first wins over top-100 players. He won third-set tiebreakers on five consecutive days, beating no. 73 Tim Henman, no. 47 Benjamin Becker, no. 189 qualifier Wayne Odesnik, no. 12 Tommy Haas, and no. 54 Gaël Monfils, to reach the final, where he fell to fellow American Andy Roddick. His week raised his ranking to no. 193 in the world after six weeks on the pro tour.
Isner's Washington success earned him wildcard entries into three more ATP tournaments: the Masters Series event in Cincinnati a week later, New Haven, and the US Open. He lost in the first round in Cincinnati to quarterfinalist no. 15 David Ferrer. The following week in New Haven, he beat no. 49 Becker a second time, before falling to Ferrer for the second week in a row.
In his US Open début, he defeated the 26th-seeded player, former quarterfinalist Jarkko Nieminen, firing 34 aces along the way. He proceeded to win his second-round match against Rik de Voest, before losing in the third round to top seed and eventual champion Roger Federer. Isner was one of only two players to take a set from Federer in the championship. His US Open performance improved his ranking to no. 144.
After the US Open, Isner continued to play exclusively in North America and finished the year ranked no. 107. That year, Isner was added to the United States Davis Cup team as a practice partner.[8]
2008[edit]
Isner's no. 106 ranking in November 2007 was just good enough to get him direct entry into his first Australian Open, after several players ranked above him dropped out.[9] He was defeated in the first round of the 2008 Australian Open by veteran Fabrice Santoro of France. Teamed with Croat Ivo Karlović (2 cm (1 in) taller than Isner, Karlović is currently the tallest player on the ATP tour), Isner also lost in the first round of doubles.[10]
Isner broke into the top 100 at no. 93 in February with a quarterfinal appearance at the ATP event in San Jose, beating no. 90 Florent Serra and no. 26 Tommy Haas. He maintained a top-100 ranking in the first three months of the year, beating six players in the top 100, while playing exclusively in ATP-level events. Isner played in his first French Open and Wimbledon, losing in the first round of each. He also played in the US Open, where he lost in the first round. He ended the year ranked no. 144 in the world.
2009: Reaching the Top 40[edit]
Isner qualified for the singles draw of the 2009 Heineken Open in Auckland, after winning three consecutive three-set matches in qualifying. His final match saw him bounce back from a 0–3 deficit in the third set to eventually beat Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci in a tie-breaker. In the main draw, Isner beat Albert Montañés and countryman Robby Ginepri, before ultimately exiting with a loss in the quarterfinals.
Isner received a wildcard entry into the 2009 Australian Open, after winning the United States Tennis Association's wildcard tournament, beating Donald Young and Jesse Levine along the way.[11] Despite serving 39 aces against his first-round opponent, Slovakia's Dominik Hrbatý, he lost in four sets. Isner began working with a new coach, Craig Boynton, who had coached former world no. 1 Jim Courier in the 1990s, in March 2009.[12]
At the 2009 Indian Wells tournament, Isner pulled off a major upset by defeating ninth seed Gaël Monfils. This was Isner's first win over a top-10 player, after four previous defeats. He then went on to defeat former world no. 1 Marat Safin, before losing to world no. 6 Juan Martín del Potro in the fourth round.
In April 2009 at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas, at River Oaks Country Club, Isner made it as far as the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by fellow American Wayne Odesnik.[13] Isner qualified for the French Open, but had to withdraw after being diagnosed with mononucleosis, which caused him to miss Wimbledon as well.[14]
In August 2009, he defeated world no. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and world no. 18 Tomáš Berdych en route to the semifinals of the ATP World Tour 500 event in Washington, before losing to world no. 5 Andy Roddick. This performance brought him to a career-high ranking of no. 55 and a special exemption into the Masters 1000 Series event in Montreal, where he defeated Jesse Levine, before losing to Mikhail Youzhny. He earned a wildcard into the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati, where he defeated world no. 21 Tommy Haas, before losing to world no. 35 Jérémy Chardy in the second round.




Isner's forehand return to Verdasco at the 2009 US Open


Unseeded and ranked no. 55 in the world entering the US Open, Isner defeated world no. 29 Victor Hănescu in the first round, which was his first win in a Grand Slam tournament since the 2007 US Open, ending a streak of six consecutive defeats. He then advanced to the third round, where he defeated world no. 5 and fellow American Andy Roddick in five sets for his first victory over Roddick, his first victory in a five-set match, and the first time he advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament. He was then defeated in the fourth round by world no. 10 Fernando Verdasco in four sets. His US Open performance brought his ranking to a career-high no. 39.
After playing in Vienna, Basel, and the Paris Masters, Isner finished the year at a career-high no. 34 in the world. He has credited his work with Boynton for helping him get back on track following his disappointing 2008 season.[12]
His progress was acknowledged by his peers, as he was voted the ATP Most Improved Player for 2009,[15] becoming the tenth American to win the award, and the first since Andre Agassi in 1998.
2010: First ATP title, longest match in history[edit]




Isner hits a forehand.


Isner began the year at the 2010 Heineken Open in Auckland. Unseeded, he reached his second career ATP final and first since Washington in 2007. In the final, he saved a championship point to defeat 2001 Australian Open finalist Arnaud Clément.[16][17] The victory in Auckland was Isner's first ATP tour title; after the victory he donated $5,000 of his winnings to aid rescue action for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[18]
The victory catapulted Isner into the top 30 for the first time and also allowed him to surpass Sam Querrey to become the second highest-ranked American for the first time, behind only Andy Roddick.[12] Isner said he intended to finish the year in the top 20,[18] and given his ascendency in the world rankings combined with the absence of Roddick and James Blake for the 2010 Davis Cup season, it became increasingly likely that Isner would qualify to play singles for the US Davis Cup team for the first time in his career.[12]
After Gilles Simon withdrew, Isner became the final seed for the 2010 Australian Open.[19] In the first round, he defeated world no. 49 Andreas Seppi for his first victory at the Australian Open and his first victory at a Grand Slam other than the US Open. He then advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 4 and eventual finalist Andy Murray.
After the Australian Open, Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe announced that Isner and Querrey would be first and second singles on the 2010 United States Davis Cup team for the team's 2010 Davis Cup World Group first-round match in Serbia on indoor clay in March 2010; Isner described the selection as "a dream come true".[20]
Isner next entered the 2010 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis. Seeded sixth, he made it to the finals, before losing to Sam Querrey. In the doubles event, Isner teamed up with Querrey to win the tournament, defeating British-Australian pair of Ross Hutchins and Jordan Kerr.
Prior to the Davis Cup tie, Isner competed at the 2010 Abierto Mexicano Telcel Championships, an ATP World Tour 500 series event on clay, where he was the fifth seed. He lost in the first round to Simon Greul. Despite the loss, Isner following the tournament moved into the top 20 for the first time.
Isner appeared at the 2010 Davis Cup first round, where USA was up against Serbia. In his two singles matches, he faced Serbia's team of world no. 2 Novak Djokovic and world no. 35 Viktor Troicki. He lost the first singles match against Viktor Troicki, but bounced back by winning the doubles match with Bob Bryan, as a replacement for food-poisoned Mike Bryan. In his second singles match, he lost to Novak Djokovic, which enabled Serbia to defeat the United States.
At the 2010 BNP Paribas Open Masters 1000 in Indian Wells, he was seeded 15th and advanced to the fourth round, before losing to world no. 2 and defending champion Rafael Nadal.
Afterwards, he appeared in the second master series tournament of the season, the 2010 Sony Ericsson Open Masters 1000 in Miami as the 17th seed. He advanced to the third round, before losing to 12th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero.
Isner began the clay-court season with an opening-round loss to world no. 89 Xavier Malisse at the U.S. Men's Claycourt Championship, followed by a round of 32 showing at his first-ever Rome Masters, where he defeated Horacio Zeballos, before losing to Thomaz Bellucci. However, he teamed with Querrey to reach the doubles final in Rome, before losing to Bob and Mike Bryan; his doubles performance raised his doubles ranking to the top 30 for the first time.
His next tournament was the 2010 Serbian Open, where he was the second seed behind defending champion, tournament host, and world no. 2 Djokovic. Isner advanced to the first clay-court final of his career, third final of the year, and fourth final of his career. In the final, he lost to Querrey, despite having a match point; this was the second consecutive final Isner lost to Querrey after serving for the championship. However, Isner's finals performance improved his ranking to a career-high no. 19.
Isner's next tournament was his debut appearance at the Madrid Masters. Seeded thirteenth, he advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 3 and eventual champion Nadal.
Isner then played in the 2010 French Open; his ranking assured his first direct seed into a Grand Slam event. Seeded 17th, he defeated Andrey Golubev in the first round for his first singles victory at the French Open. He advanced to the third round, before losing to no. 15 seed and eventual semifinalist Tomáš Berdych. In doubles, he and Querrey were the 12th seeds, but withdrew prior to the start of the tournament after Querrey's first-round loss in singles.
Despite being ranked no. 19 in the world entering the Wimbledon, Isner was seeded 24th by the tournament committee due to his lack of experience on grass, but was moved up to 23rd following the withdrawal of Radek Štěpánek. In the first round, Isner played Nicolas Mahut in the longest match in tennis history, prevailing 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.[21] However, fatigued and having little time to recover his energy, Isner was beaten by Thiemo de Bakker in the second round, 0–6, 3–6, 2–6, having served no aces. He also pulled out of the doubles, where he and Querrey had been 12th seeds.[22] Despite having been eliminated in the second round, Isner's total of 113 aces[23] were more than any other player throughout the championship. His Wimbledon performance brought his ranking to a career-high no. 18 in the world.
Isner's next tournament was the 2010 Atlanta Tennis Championships, where he played doubles with James Blake and reached the semifinals. In singles, Isner was second seed and made it to his fourth final of the year, before losing to Mardy Fish, which dropped his career record in finals to 1–4 (0–4 against Americans).
Isner next competed at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, the ATP World Tour 500 series event in Washington, D.C. and site of his breakthrough performance in 2007. Isner was also to compete in the doubles with Sam Querrey, but withdrew due to shoulder concerns. Seeded fifth in singles, Isner made it to the round of 16, before losing to Xavier Malisse.
Isner next played in the Cincinnati Masters, where he was unseeded. After defeating Łukasz Kubot in the first round, he faced 2002 Wimbledon finalist and 2005 Tennis Masters Cup champion David Nalbandian, but was forced to retire up a break at 5–4 in the first set after injuring his right ankle. Although Isner was found to have suffered ligament damage to the ankle, he chose not to withdraw from the US Open singles tournament.[24]
At the 2010 US Open, Isner was 18th seed and defeated Frederico Gil in the first round. After the match he revealed that although the initial diagnosis was a right ankle ligament tear, a second opinion revealed that the damage was a strain and not a tear, and he declared his ankle 90% healed.[25][26] He then advanced to the third round, before losing to 12th seed and 2006 US Open semifinalist Mikhail Youzhny. The loss dropped Isner out of the top 20, and from the no. 2 to the no. 4 ranked American player. Due to his ankle injury, he chose not to compete in doubles.
Following the US Open, Isner participated with Mardy Fish and Sam Querrey in the Davis Cup tie against Colombia, winning the doubles match with Fish as his partner. The US won the match 3–1 to remain in the 2011 Davis Cup world group.[27] Isner was next granted a wildcard to participate in the 2010 China Open, his first time competing in Beijing.

Nadal went on to win the title.[32] In the 2011 Wimbledon men's singles draw, Isner was paired against Mahut in the first round, a rematch of the world's longest match from the previous year's tournament. Isner won in straight sets. However, he lost in the second round to the 16th seed Nicolás Almagro in four sets, dropping his 2011 record to 11–14.
Isner next took a last-minute wild card to participate in the 2011 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships, replacing compatriot and defending champion Mardy Fish, who was chosen to play in the Davis Cup for the United States during that weekend. Isner was the top seed and defeated Karol Beck, 2001 Australian Open finalist Arnaud Clément, Alex Bogomolov, Jr., and Tobias Kamke without dropping a set, to reach his first career grass-court final. In the final, he defeated Olivier Rochus to become the first top seed in 35 years to win the event. The title was his first of 2011 and second of his career, and ended a three-match losing streak in finals. The championship raised Isner's world ranking from no. 48 to no. 36.

Isner then reached the semifinals of the Delray Beach International Tennis Championships, losing to eventual champion Marin Čilić in straight sets.
At the 2014 Indian Wells Masters, Isner received a bye into round two, after which he defeated Nikolay Davydenko, Lu Yen-hsun, Fernando Verdasco, and Ernests Gulbis en route to the semifinals, where he would face Novak Djokovic in a rematch of their 2012 semifinal. However, this time Isner lost in three sets. The semifinal run in Indian Wells did however secure him a return to the top 10.
At the Miami Masters, Isner again received a bye into round two, where he faced and beat countryman Donald Young. He then defeated Nicolás Almagro in the third round, only to lose to Tomáš Berdych in the fourth round.
In Houston, he was defending a title, but lost his first match in the second round to Dustin Brown. With the points he lost, he slipped out of the top ten to a ranking of no. 11.
In Madrid, he teamed up with Tomáš Berdych in the doubles draw. In singles, he made it to the third round, where he lost to David Ferrer. He went down in the first round at the Rome Masters 1000.
In Nice the week before the French Open, he made it to the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by Argentine Federico Delbonis. At Roland Garros, he reached the fourth round, where he went down to Berdych. He did not play a grass tune-up tournament before Wimbledon.

At the US Open, Isner reached the third round, where he lost to Philipp Kohlschreiber for the third consecutive year.
Isner hired Justin Gimelstob as his new coach at the end of the 2014 season.[39]

2015: Tenth ATP title and new highest year-end finish[edit]
Isner started the season slowly, making the third round of the Australian Open and having only a quarterfinal showing in Memphis before making it into the semifinals in Miami with three wins in a row defeating Dimitrov, Raonic, and Nishikori. He lost to Djokovic in the semifinals.
He lost to Djokovic again in straight sets in Indian Wells in the third round after winning qualifier Jürgen Melzer in the second round. In Monte Carlo, he lost to Rafael Nadal in the third round. He made the quarterfinals in Madrid, where he lost to Tomáš Berdych. In Nice, he made the semifinals, losing to Dominic Thiem.

At Roland Garros, he lost to Jérémy Chardy in the second round. On grass, he made the quarterfinals at Queen's Club and the third round at Wimbledon to Marin Cilic in his third-round match at Wimbledon. In this match, Isner played another marathon, eventually losing to the then-world no. 9 by 10-12 in the fifth set after two days of play.
Isner lost in the first round in Newport to eventual champion Rajeev Ram. He successfully defended his title in Atlanta in July to win his 10th Tour title and third in a row in the tournament, defeating Marcos Baghdatis in the final in straight sets. The following week, he reached the final of the 500 tournament in Washington DC, losing in the final to Kei Nishikori. He also reached the quarterfinals of the Rogers Cup in Montréal, losing in three tiebeaks to Jérémy Chardy. However, the next week in Cincinnati, he went out in the first round against Sam Querrey. He skipped Winston-Salem, his home tournament, the week before the US Open.
At the US Open, Isner advanced to the fourth round, losing to Federer in straight sets, but nonetheless marked his best Grand Slam result of the year. He reached the third round in Shanghai, before losing to Andy Murray in three sets and made his third quarterfinal Masters appearance of the year in Paris, after beating Federer in three sets. Isner finished the year at his best year-end ranking to date, at world no. 11.
2016: Third Masters final and seventh consecutive top-20 finish[edit]
Isner started his season in Auckland and reached the quarterfinals, losing to eventual champion, Roberto Bautista Agut.[40] At Australian Open, he reached the fourth round for the first time since 2010 defeating Spaniards Marcel Granollers and Feliciano López before losing in straights sets to David Ferrer.[41] Instead of playing the US spring hardcourt tournaments, Isner decided to play two clay court tournaments in South America, losing his first match in both to Dusan Lajovic in Argentina and Guido Pella in Brazil.[42] In the first round of Davis Cup, Isner defeated Bernard Tomic and Sam Groth to help upset Australia 3-1 and move the United States into the quarterfinals against Croatia.[43]
Isner reached the fourth round at BNP Paribas Open for the third year in a row before losing to Kei Nishikori, and he was then upset early in Miami Open by Tim Smyczek.[44] Despite missing most of the clay season, only playing U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships and Geneva Open, Isner reached the fourth round of the French Open for only the second time in his career, losing to eventual finalist Andy Murray in straight sets.[45] Isner's season continued with early losses in both grass tournaments he played, losing to Gilles Müller at Aegon Championships and losing a marathon match to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at Wimbledon.[46]
Isner started the US Open Series with a disappointing loss in the second round of the Rogers Cup to Ryan Harrison.[47] Isner rebounded by reaching his first final of the season and his fourth consecutive final at the Atlanta Open, losing in straight sets to Nick Kyrgios.[48] Isner skipped the Summer Olympics due to a lack of ranking points and prize money, electing to focus on the summer hardcourt tournaments of the US Open Series.[49] After Isner lost in straight sets in the second round to Milos Raonic, and Steve Johnson reached the quarterfinals in Cincinnati, Isner lost the title of the top-ranked American man for the first time in three years.[50] Although he regained it in the following week, Johnson took it back over following the US Open, after Isner was unable to defend his fourth round points, losing in the third round to Kyle Edmund in four sets.[51]
Isner teamed up with Jack Sock to win his second Masters doubles title and fourth overall doubles title at the Shanghai Masters.[52] Unseeded at the final regular tournament of the season, Isner would prevail against seeded players David Ferrer and Marin Cilic to reach his third Masters final and second final of the season at the Paris Masters.[53] His semi-final victory allowed Isner to again finish the year as the No. 1 American for the fifth consecutive year and inside the Top 20 for the seventh consecutive season. In the final, Isner lost to the newly crowned world number 1 Andy Murray, thus leaving him titleless in singles for the first time since 2009.[54]
2017[edit]
Isner reached quarterfinals in Auckland, Memphis, and Houston. He reached the semifinals in Rome at the Italian Open, where he was defeated by eventual champion Alexander Zverev. At the French Open, Isner came off to a strong start, beating Jordan Thompson and Paolo Lorenzi in the first and second rounds, respectively. However, he fell in the third round to Karen Khachanov in 4 sets.
Isner competed at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, where he defeated qualifier Taylor Fritz in the first round before losing to Dudi Sela in 5 sets the following match. At the Dell Technologies Hall of Fame Open in Newport, Isner defeated qualifier Matthew Ebden 6-3, 7-6(4) in the final to win his first singles title of the year.
Longest match in history[edit]
Main article: Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships
At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, Isner (ranked 23), faced qualifier Nicolas Mahut in the first round. Isner won the match 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.
The final set alone was longer than the previous longest match.
In the match, Isner set the record for most aces in a match, breaking Ivo Karlović's record of 78; Mahut passed the old mark as well.[55] Isner set a new record of 113 aces, ahead of the 103 aces served by Mahut.
The first four sets were played on June 22. At 21:13 BST on June 23 the match was suspended due to darkness for a second day at 59–59 in the fifth set. The match resumed on June 24, at 15:30 BST,[56] starting the third day of the match. Overall, the match lasted eleven hours and five minutes. Isner also set the record for most games won in a Wimbledon match with 92.
The match brought Isner a measure of fame, particularly in the United States. He had guest appearances on "Good Morning America" and the "Late Show with David Letterman", and threw the ceremonial first pitch at a New York Yankees game in Yankee Stadium.[57][58] He and Mahut also won the 2010 ESPY Award for Best Record-Breaking Performance in sport.[59]

Playing style and equipment[edit]
Isner has an extremely powerful and consistent serve, thanks in part to his 6-ft 10-in height which makes him the third tallest player on tour behind Ivo Karlović and Reilly Opelka. Commentators[who?] have also praised his composure; in five consecutive third-set tiebreaker wins in Washington, he delivered huge serves when it mattered most.[60] Isner also has a very powerful forehand, which he uses in tandem with his serve. Isner will often go for one-two points: a big serve followed up by a big forehand. He is also known to back up his serves with approaches to the net, though he does not strictly serve-and-volley. Isner's movement around the court is hampered by his body and he is hurt by players that move him around the court. Isner's fitness has improved considerably throughout the years, as he displayed during his win in the longest tennis match ever at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut.
As of January 2012, Isner is sponsored by Lacoste and Prince for his attire and rackets respectively.[61][62] His attire carried through most of 2015. He switched his attire to FILA in 2016 at the Australian Open.
Coaches[edit]
Isner's first coach was Craig Boynton, who worked with him from 2007 to 2012, and helped develop his style of play. Isner and Boynton split over reportedly mutual agreement. Isner then hired Mike Sell, who helped him to significant success, such as defeating Roger Federer, David Nalbandian, and Novak Djokovic. During his time with Sell, Isner's ranking stayed around No.10 in the world. After parting from Sell in 2014, Isner teamed with Justin Gimelstob and worked with him until April 2016. With Gimelstob, Isner's ranking stayed around 10, until 2016, where he dropped to 17.
Personal life[edit]
Isner started playing tennis seriously at age 11. He played competitively for Westside Swim and Tennis Club in Greensboro, North Carolina, throughout his childhood. He is a graduate of Walter Hines Page Senior High School, in Greensboro,[63] and the University of Georgia, where he majored in speech communication. He currently resides in Tampa, Florida, where he trains at the Saddlebrook Academy alongside other American tennis pros such as James Blake and Mardy Fish.
Isner is a supporter of the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League and the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League.[64]
