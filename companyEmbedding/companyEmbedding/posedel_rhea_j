Welcome to the Aehr Test Systems third quarter fiscal 2010 earnings conference call.  During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen only mode.  Following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions.  (Operator Instructions)  Now, I’d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lasse Glassen of the Financial Relations Board.
Lasse Glassen

Thanks for joining us to discuss Aehr Test Systems’ results for the third quarter of fiscal 2010.  By now you should have all received a copy of today’s press release.  If not, you can call my office at area code 213-486-6546 and we’ll get you a copy right away.  With us today from Aehr Test are Rhea Posedel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Larson, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Management will review its operating performance for the quarter before opening the call to your questions.  Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Larson.  
Gary L. Larson 
Before we begin, I’d like to make a few comments about forward-looking statements.  Please be advised that during the course of our discussion today we may make forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to projections regarding industry growth and customer demand for Aehr Test product as well as projections regarding Aehr Test’s future financial performance.  
Actual results may differ materially from projected results and should not be considered as an indication of future performance.  These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, world economic conditions, the timing of the recovery of the semiconductor equipment market, acceptance by customer of Aehr Test’s technologies, acceptance by customers of the systems shipped upon receipt of a purchase order, the ability of new products to meet customer needs or performance described, the company’s development, manufacture and marketing of a commercially successful wafer level test and burn in system and the potential emergency of alternative technologies, each of which could adversely affect demand for Aehr Test’s products in calendar year 2010.
We refer you to our most recent 10K and 10Q reports and other reports from time-to-time filed with the US Securities & Exchange Commission for a more detailed description of the risks facing our business and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results.  The company disclaims any obligation to update our information contained in any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this conference call.
Now, I’d like to introduce our chairman and CEO Rhea Posedel.
Rhea J. Posedel 
Welcome to our conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.  Before I start, I just wanted to mention that in case the quality of the call is bad, I’m calling from Texas, I’m down here visiting on some potential customers I hope.  I’m pleased to report that pro forma revenue for the third quarter was $2.5 million, up 49% on a sequential quarter basis.  On a GAAP basis, our revenue for the third quarter was $5.2 million with a net profit of $1.5 million.
The GAAP numbers includes the sale of the remainder of our Spansion US Bankruptcy claim primarily related to the cancelation of wafer pack orders that were mostly built.  I would like to point out that our $2.5 million in revenues do not include the acceptance of the FOX-15 system we shipped to Micronas in our second quarter.  Even though the system is running production wafers, the customer has not completed the formal acceptance process.  We are now planning to receive customer acceptance and recognize revenue for the FOX-15 during our fiscal fourth quarter.

There are several highlights from this past quarter that I’d like to bring to your attention.  We are most excited about winning a production order for ABTS burn-in system from a major Japanese integrated device manufacturer.  This customer ordered a specially configured ABTS optimized for burn-in and testing of their high end micro controllers.  In addition, the ABTS will be designed to include a burn-in board automation which integrates in to their factory automation.
The first order was for a single system, however, we hope to receive follow on production orders starting in our next fiscal year.  This is an important order for Aehr Test for a couple of reasons.  First, it’s a major accomplishment to win a production burn-in system order in a country where large IC manufacturers generally buy from local suppliers.  In addition, we believe this order further validates the performance capabilities of the ABTS platform and is evidence that it can be a cost effective production tool for packaged part burn-in test of logic devices.  
Another highlight was the announcement today of a MAX-4i burn-in system to a second major Japanese integrated device manufacturer for burn-in of logic devices with individual temperature control per device.  If our first installation goes successfully we think we could receive follow on production orders in a few quarters.  This is another major account win for us and lays the foundation for growing our business over the next few quarters.
Also during the third quarter, we shipped over $1 million in FOX-1 system upgrades to Spansion.  We believe these FOX-1 shipments are significant because they indicated that Spansion is investing in our FOX-1 solution for full wafer test in a single touch down for their Austin fab.  We are hopeful that we will receive additional wafer pack orders as their business expands over the next few quarters.
We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see for the ABTS product family this coming year.  The quoting activity the past few months has been high for burn-in of low to high power logic ICs including those requiring individual temperature control per device.  We believe the ABTS system offers cost savings and performance advantages that will allow us to penetrate and expanding share in this growing market segment for medium to high power logic burn-in above 10 watts per device.
While we continue to aggressively market our FOX-1 full wafer parallel tester and FOX-15 wafer level burn-in systems, we do not have new orders to report at this time.  However, we are making inroads in to a number of accounts where we’re seeing interest levels for a variety of applications such as sensors, automotive ICs, MIMs just to name a few.  
Capital is still tight, particularly in the automotive sector but we are hopeful to convert some of these prospects to orders.  We believe that over time over the long term more multi chip module stack dye and 3D packaging producers will need known good dye solutions to produce high yielding modules.  Our strategy continues to be focused on penetrating as many production accounts as possible with our new ABTS and FOX products.  This will allow us to expand our customer base and grow market share. 
Since our last conference call we’ve penetrated two Japanese IDMs and we’re confident in our ability to expand our customer base and achieve our growth objectives because we have the strongest competitive product portfolio in our history with our FOX and ABTS platforms.  We will be increasing our R&D over the next few quarters to accelerate new product development initiatives which we expect will help the company win additional new accounts as business returns to more normal levels.
In closing, we believe Aehr Test is in a favorable position to grow market share during this recovery period enabling us to return to a growth trajectory over the next few years.  We have exciting technology with our FOX full wafer test and burn-in systems and wafer pack contactors.  We feel confident that we can continue to win additional new accounts with our ABTS products which address growing market segments for high power logic burn-in and memory applications in Asia.

Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary and he’ll discuss the third quarter financials in more detail.
Gary L. Larson 
As Rhea mentioned, net sales were $5.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.  This compares to $1.2 million in the same quarter last year.  In the third quarter of fiscal 2010 the company sold the remainder of its Spansion US Bankruptcy claim for net proceeds of approximately $4.6 million which resulted in the recording of $2.7 million as revenue related to cancellation chares, $1.3 million as deferred revenue and $.6 million as a reduction of operating expenses.
Excluding the impact of the sale of the Spansion claim, fiscal 2010 third quarter product sales were $2.5 million.  This compares to net sales of $1.2 million in the same quarter last year.  The increase was the result of the high level of net sales of the company’s wafer level products.  Gross profit was $4.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 or 77% of net sales.  This included $2.7 million in gross profit related to the Spansion bankruptcy claim.
In the third quarter last year the company recorded a gross loss of $6.8 million which included a $5.7 million provision for excess and obsolete inventory reserves that were primarily taken as a result of Spansion’s bankruptcy.  SG&A was $1.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010.  This compares to $15.3 million in the prior year period which included a $13.7 million provision for bad debt due to the Spansion bankruptcy. 
Third quarter 2010 R&D expense was $1.5 million compared with $1.6 million in the third quarter of last year.  R&D spending varies from quarter-to-quarter depending on the level of development of new product.  As I noted earlier, fiscal 2010 third quarter operating expense was also reduced by 6/10ths of $1 million as a result of the sale of the remainder of the Spansion claim.
Net income in the third quarter was $1.5 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $27.7 million or $3.28 per diluted share a year ago.  Pro forma net loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $1.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared with a pro forma net loss of $1.8 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the same period of the prior year.  In determining the pro forma, or non-GAAP net loss in the third quarter of 2010 we’ve excluded the gain on the sale of the Spansion bankruptcy claim of $3.3 million and non-cash stock compensation expenses of $.3 million.
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalent increased to $8.7 million at February 28, 2010 from $5.1 million at November 30, 2009.  The increase was primarily due to the $4.6 million in cash received in January, 2010 from the sale of the remainder of the Spansion bankruptcy claim to a third party.  We continue to remain debt free.  This concludes our prepared remarks.  We are now ready to answer your questions.  
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from [Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management].
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
Gary, can you break down the $2.5 million in sales?  You said $1 million was Spansion upgrades.  Typically $200,000 or so is service and spares, what was the rest?
Gary L. Larson 
We don’t generally give a detailed breakdown of our sales but we thought it was important to mention the Spansion upgrades because all of those were written off materials.  So basically those items has full 100% margin on them.  
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
Was the rest the MAX equipment?
Gary L. Larson 
Again, we don’t generally give the full breakdown of the revenue?
Rhea J. Posedel 
There were spares.  I believe we did sell a MAX to a local US company.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]

What will it take for Micronas to accept the FOX?  What further demonstration do they need?
Rhea J. Posedel 
They’re running it in production.  It’s one of these things where they need to take the system down to let us do some things and it’s basically just a timing.  They don’t want to give up the system.  It’s more of that than anything.  So, it’s very little that has to be done so it’s just a matter of fitting in to their production schedule.  Hopefully, we’re going to do that this quarter.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
Do they owe you any more cash for it?
Gary L. Larson 
Yes, they owe 25% of the selling price.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
So you have received 75% in cash already?
Gary L. Larson 
That’s correct.

[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
What are you hearing about Spansion Japan?
Rhea J. Posedel 
I know it’s an excellent question and we’re always staying on top of that and as far as we’re hearing they’re not running wafers.  It looks like they’re trying to sell off their equipment.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
How many FOX machines are at Spansion Japan?
Rhea J. Posedel 
20.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
And what will happen to them?
Rhea J. Posedel 
We don’t know.  We actually would look forward to them being sold and purchased by another company besides Spansion.  But, I don’t know.  It’s very complicated so we just get second hand information from them.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
Do you have any idea when that Spansion Japan will get resolved?
Rhea J. Posedel 
I don’t.  Gary, do you have any information on that?
Gary L. Larson 
No, I don’t.  As I’ve mentioned in the past, the status of the Spansion Japan bankruptcy is very difficult to assess.  There’s little information that is publically shared.  It is not at all like the US side where we have filings every day that we can review and go through.  It really is a matter of just listening as well as we can and trying to get some insight but we haven’t heard anything as far as what might happen.  Any equipment sale obviously would have to be approved by the bankruptcy court in Japan.  We have heard that GE Credit has the task of trying to locate buyers.  So again, as Rhea said, we’d be anxious to see a third party come in and buy that equipment and use it productively.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
Would you expect GE Credit to go to both Spansion Austin and yourselves as a potential buyer of that FOX equipment?
Gary L. Larson 
If I were GE Credit I would go to any entities that I think I could sell it to.  The difficulty in the past has been since Spansion US is also in bankruptcy is getting the two different bankruptcy courts to agree on anything.  They haven’t been very successful in that so far.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
What are you hearing about the Spansion US bankruptcy?  
Gary L. Larson 
Spansion US bankruptcy, they had previously announced that they expected to exit bankruptcy in the first calendar quarter.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
That was today.
Gary L. Larson 
Very good.  I was going to point that out if nobody else did.  I’ve noticed on their docket filings that they’re scheduling continuation hearings in to April and May.  So it would obviously be possible at any point in time for them to exit, but since I’m still seeing substantive meetings out there I’m guess that we’re at least talking about the later part of the second quarter. 
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
Is that delaying their ordering pattern any?
Gary L. Larson 
The impression that we’ve gotten on that is that they’re only allowed to order on a hand to mouth basis.  So if they have current order activity that they would have to walk away from if they didn’t order equipment, then they’re allowed to order it.  But, they’re not really allowed to anticipate business that might come down the pipe six months out or nine months out.  Most semiconductor manufacturers due that kind of anticipative ordering so we would hope when they exit bankruptcy that could benefit us.

[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
So they can order spares and things like that, they can’t order a new wafer pack.
Rhea J. Posedel 
No, they can if they have a production need for it and they can prove they have a production need for it to ship product in the current quarter, they can order it.  But, they can’t forecast and say, “We think the next two quarters we’re going to need additional systems or additional wafer packs.”  Maybe the product is not ready or the customer hasn’t given them the firm orders yet, they can’t buy that type of equipment.  But, if they can prove they need systems or wafer packs to meet shipments, to make shipment requirements then they can order it.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
There was $1 million worth of deliveries in the February quarter, can you be more specific about their ordering pattern subsequent to the February 28th quarter?
Rhea J. Posedel 
I think what we’re looking at now, again, the visibility from them is very short, but it would probably be this quarter if they order anything, it would be wafer packs not system upgrades.  We’ve upgraded four or five system from 200 to 300 millimeter and we’d expect maybe to get some wafer pack orders to fill up those systems.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
On the website, the Aehr Test website, there are no jobs posted.  What has you headcount been over the past quarter?
Rhea J. Posedel 
We haven’t added any bodies over the last quarter.  I did say we would increase R&D but probably won’t increase headcount so we have variable labor opportunities that we could either hire temporary people, we have a number of software people in India and various places that we can add and expand.  It would probably be our engineering expenses will go up because of some consulting but also some materials that we have to buy for some of the new developments that we’re doing for our Japanese customer.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
What kind of additional features do you need to put on to your machines in order to make them saleable?  What I’m trying to get at is [inaudible]?
Rhea J. Posedel 
One large customer for example, they wanted to change minor things like changing the board to board spacing, or we need to reconfigure the ABTS for higher power applications.  So as we said all along, it’s a very configurable system so the electronics can be plugged in to different back planes.  So in some way we’re creating a new back plane or new interface for the burn-in board.  It’s more development type engineering as opposed to R&D.  It’s not doing advanced work in that sense.  It’s maybe repackaging our ABTS technology for different applications. 
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
It’s really reconfiguring?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Correct.  Reconfiguring might be a back plane, or interface board or something of that sort, or racks.  In one case we’re putting in burn-in board automation so we can automatically load the burn-in boards in and out of the system, things of that sort.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
Is this an existing customer that has asked you to do this?
Rhea J. Posedel 
No, these would be new customers for ABTS.  
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
Is it kind of your understanding that if you can get the ABTS configured that way that they will buy it?
Rhea J. Posedel 
That’s correct.  If it meets their qualifications. 
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
So you’re well down the sales cycle with them?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Correct.  So hopefully the next quarter or two we’ll have another announcement of another major account win for the ABTS.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
How many ABTS systems have you now delivered?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Somewhere between five to 10, I’m not sure.  It’s mostly with different customers.  

Gary L. Larson 
Probably on the lower end of that range.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
What are you finding in terms of your cost of goods sold as you manufacturer more systems?  Is the cost coming down?
Gary L. Larson 
Because of the very low volume level that we’ve had during the past year it’s a little bit hard to give any good cost of goods information on the ABTS.  Our MAX and MTX products, when we were at more traditional volume levels were typically in the high 40% range, our FOX products were generally in the low 50% range and we would expect the ABTS on an ongoing basis to be probably in the low 50% range.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
That’s where you are or what you want to get to?
Gary L. Larson 
Again, there have been so few ABTS’ right now that it’s hard to generalize on our costs particularly with the volume levels that we’ve been seeing.  We’ll have to hold off on what it will look like.  I was just giving you my guess.
Rhea J. Posedel 
Certainly, we’re not there now as Gary mentioned.  It’s where we want to get to basically.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
The MAX-4i that you talked about, what was new and different about that particular [inaudible]?
Rhea J. Posedel 
What was exciting for us was that we penetrated a major Japanese manufacturer.  What was unique about it for him was that they were using traditional Japanese burn-in systems but our MAX4-200 could deliver higher [kern], the oven could provide higher power dissipation than the current system they’re using.  It’s a proven solution, we had 96 channels and it could also do this independent temperature control per [duct] so we had that feature in the MAX-4 and it’s the i feature, there’s additional power supplies and reconfiguring the driver boards to provide the extra current so that’s why they bought the MAX4.  They couldn’t burn-in these high powered devices under existing systems without a huge amount of modification.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
These were micro controllers?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Micro controllers for high end consumer products, maybe like 3D TVs, things like that sort.  So the volume of systems they’ll buy in the future could be a lot or a few depending on how well their product succeeds in the marketplace. 
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
This was a new customer?
Rhea J. Posedel 
A new customer.  This is a new customer, I don’t think we’ve sold to this customer ever.  The first ABTS customer we had sold products 15 years ago to or 20 years ago.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
The second one, the MAX-4i, this is for production?
Rhea J. Posedel 
It’s for production, the plan is for production.
[Jeffrey Scott – Scott Asset Management]
So there is large hope for more orders from that particular customer?
Rhea J. Posedel 
That’s the plan and that’s the hope.  If we’re successful with our first system we’d expect to see follow on orders within the first half of fiscal 2011.

Your next question comes from John Evans – Edmunds White Partners.
John Evans – Edmunds White Partners
Can you talk a little bit about I guess with the increases you’re going to have in R&D kind of where you estimate you guys will be from a breakeven point or where you have to get to from a revenue standpoint?  Then, I don’t know if you talk about this but can you give us kind of a sense of book to build, was your bookings stronger than kind of your deliveries or can you give us any kind of insight?
Gary L. Larson 
We don’t generally talk about our book to build, we do declare our backlog at the end of the fiscal year but we don’t give interim bookings or backlog information.  Generally, if we have what we consider to be important orders either from the standpoint of size, or if we consider them to be critical new customer opportunities, then we will put those orders out on press releases.  So, it’s somewhat easy to at least keep track of the big ones that have come through that way.

With regard to the R&D, Rhea did mention that we anticipate some additional R&D spending.  But, what we also see is R&D often times in our business is quite variable from one quarter to the next so there isn’t a set number that we’re putting out there.  We just wanted to put out an early warning that R&D might start to climb somewhat.  
As far as a breakeven point, in the past what we’ve said is everything is very much dependent upon mix because as we’ve discussed some of our products right now, written off materials end up having 100% margin and then there are more standard products that are less, and we’re also at quite a low level right now.  So, it’s hard to really access the breakeven.  What we’ve said in the past, at our current expense level, probably we’d be in the $5 to $6 million range to see breakeven.
John Evans – Edmunds White Partners
Several of your big customers I think, Texas is your biggest customer, they’ve all talked about having capacity constraints on the test side.  I guess if you look at a lot of the back end companies, they’ve started to see that.  I guess can you help us understand maybe why you potentially are a lager in that or why you haven’t seen as much ramp yet?
Rhea J. Posedel 
That’s a good question.  In particular, speaking about Texas Instruments where they certainly had bottlenecks in testers so I think we’re kind of at the end of that chain for them.  First, they need fab capacity, then it becomes assembly, then test capacity and then I think after that hopefully it’s going to be they need more burn-in capacity.
Jon Evans – Edmunds White Partners
But you don’t believe that you’ve lost share at Texas?
Rhea J. Posedel 
No, no, no, I don’t think so.  I’ll find out more tomorrow.  Then Austin, I’m going to go to Dallas tomorrow.  It’s my mission.
Jon Evans – Edmunds White Partners
So what we should believe is they’re saying on their conference call that they’re saying they’re getting more in line from the test side, hopefully 60, 90 or 120 days from that you should see that in on the burn-in side?
Rhea J. Posedel 
At least some of it.  It depends on where they are capacity wide in our systems and product mix.  Some of their devices maybe don’t need burn-in or they don’t do as much burn-in on them and other ones do.  So, different devices at different times require more or less.  They’re automotive devices require 24 hour burn-in, they’re DSPs maybe require less, or just early life type burn-in so it does depend on their product mix somewhat.  But, if general, if they’re seeing a push in all areas then I think that’s going to be to our advantage.
They had a number of our test systems turned off in 2009 when they’re volumes were low.  Now, I think pretty much all of them are turned back on.  So if they see any increase in capacity they’ll have to add burn-in systems.  But, we haven’t lost share with them.
Jon Evans – Edmunds White Partners
I know you didn’t want to answer this before and it’s difficult because of the different products and mixes, but I guess can you help us understand maybe why you feel comfortable with kicking R&D up with sales at such low levels?  What I guess I’m trying to get to is can you help us understand from a cash basis, will you not burn cash then over the next couple of quarters?  Can you give us any insight in to that?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Basically I looked at it as a positive in the sense that, and maybe Jeff kind of alluded, he was prying me on that, what is it for?  It’s not major new developments but it’s doing some customization or specialization and modification of these system for a few customers to get qualified and get some production orders.  It’s just spending money on materials to win some new accounts.  That’s all.  It’s not going to be 50% higher or whatever, but maybe 10% or 20% higher than what we’re normally running.  It’s things that we need to do to win orders and it means that we’re fairly far along the sales cycle to win these orders.

Jon Evans – Edmunds White Partners
May I just ask you then relative to that, can you give us any kind of sense of size of those if you’re successful in basically redoing the system to those specifications?  How much business potentially is there to win here?
Rhea J. Posedel 
That’s a good question.  It could be 10 to 50 systems over a few years.
Jon Evans – Edmunds White Partners
The last question I had for you is when you think about test capacity, the test companies kind of talk about utilization, capacity utilization, is there any way for you to talk to your customers or give us a sense of kind of utilization of your systems and kind of what’s the breaking point before they have to start to add significant capacity?
Rhea J. Posedel 
It really depends on which ones we have service contracts in.  For example, at Texas Instruments we have service contracts so we know what systems are turned on and turned off and are utilized.  But, other accounts we don’t have that visibility and there are a lot of accounts that we’re not in so it’s hard for us to figure that out.  There’s no research that’s done in our sector.  The only way you can do it is go around and call on customers and try and find out that way and how they’re doing.  But our objective is to penetrate more new accounts with our products.  That’s our major goal this year so we can spread our customer base rather than just have Spansion and Texas Instructions, we want to have multiple production customers.

Your next question comes from [Joy Muckergee] – Unidentified.
[Joy Muckergee] – Unidentified
Most of the questions have been answered but will you talk a little bit about the NOR market and what the outlook is for NOR flash?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Well, I think certainly the growth that you read about is in the NAN Flash.  Obviously Spansion is bullish about their business going forward although they’ve shrunk it kind of jettison the mobile market.  But, we feel there’s still growth at Spansion because right now they just have a few FOX-1s and wafer packs so most of the systems that we sold them are in Japan in the bankrupt part of their company. 
I think that NOR flash is still going to be there, there’s still a market for it and I don’t see it going away any time soon.  A NAN flash if you need high density memory, cheap memory that’s flash memory, that’s the way to go.  But, there’s a lot of applications where you don’t need that much memory that you need the reliability of the NOR flash.  So there is this strong segment for NOR flash.  I don’t see anything that is going to change it.  As they grow in density, the test times get longer so they need more test equipment.
[Joy Muckergee] – Unidentified
Then on the competitive front, has anything changed?  Is Form Factor a bigger player against what you do?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Form Factor makes the prob cards.  They can compete against us I guess on our wafer packs for the FOX-1s if they can do full wafer up to that density, maybe.  Certainly, they’re trying to.
[Joy Muckergee] – Unidentified
So other than that you haven’t seen much of change in the landscape?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Not on the system approach arena.  
Operator

Management, I’m showing no further questions.  Please continue with any further remarks.
Rhea J. Posedel 
This is Rhea and I’d like to thank you for joining us this afternoon and we look forward to next quarter’s conference call.  Thanks and good evening.

Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal2008 were $9.7 million up 55% over the same quarter of the prior year and up26% sequentially.  Importantly asignificant portion of our revenue increase flowed to operating income whichincreased by $1.7 million over the same quarter of the prior year.  
We continued to be excited about the significant growth opportunities we seefor our FOX-1 testers and WaferPaks. Earlier this quarter we announced a $13 million follow on order formultiple FOX-1 testers for a new 300mm fab. Our highly paralleled FOX-1 full wafer tester and its WaferPakcontactors moves the company into the large growing market for wafer protesting.  This is a new market Aehr Testand it significantly expands our addressable markets.  Industry experts estimate that the totalavailable market for wafer pro testing including the consumable probe cards isin excess of $3 billion per year.  Withour FOX-1 product we are targeting the market segments for ICs with long testtimes such as flash memories.  

Also orders for our WaferPak contactors were solid during thequarter providing further evidence that this can bea potential strongrevenue stream and we expect additional orders as our installed based of 300mmFOX-1 testers increases.  Our full Wafercontactors are customdesigned for each wafer device type.  Itis a keytechnology that enables our FOX-1 system to parallel test thousands of die ina singletouchdown.  Designing and producingcustomer WaferPak contactors that can contact thousand of die over a300mm wafer is a majortechnical challenge.  During thequarter we continued to invest inthe development ofdesign tools and manufacturing processes to increase our WaferPak capacity andreduce our cycle times.  I’m pleased to saythat we made significant progress this past quarter but we still have aways to go.  
Another major event of the quarter was shipping our firstFOX-15 wafer level burn-in and test system for a leading automotive ICmanufacturer.  We are proud of the broadtechnical accomplishments of our engineering team that made this possible.  The FOX-15 system is a second generationwafer level burn-in and test system.  Itis our first system to utilize our newly designed configurable hardware andsoftware platform.  Our major technicalchallenge was developing WaferPak contactors that can work reliably andrepeatedly during the high temperature requirements of wafer level burn-in andtest.  
We believe shipping our FOX-15 systems helps validates thatour technology is a costeffective solution for processing wafers for automotive and known good dieapplications.  We arenow aggressively targeting these growing markets with our FOX-15 wafer levelburn-in and test system.  We haveinstalled our FOX-15 system and our customer hasstarted to run qualification wafers.  Weexpect the acceptancephase correlation studies to belengthy as our customer wants to domultiple burn-in runs to ensure that thewafers processed by our FOX-15 system meets their automotive customer’sstringent quality and reliability specifications.  This acceptance could take up to sixmonths or more but we arehopefully that itcould happen in ourfourth quarter.  Revenue for this multimillion dollar system will berecorded following customer acceptance.  
Our near term goal is to add one or two new customers forour FOX products and grow market share in the rapidly expanded automotive testequipment or ATE market segment for full wafer test and burn-in.  We continue to see interest in both our FOXproducts however; it seemed to always take longer than you expect to penetrateproduction accounts with a new technology. 
The balance of this fiscal year we will continue to investin R&D to improve the performance of our core parallel test and burn-insystems for packaged devices.  Ourobjective is to roll out new products over the next six to 12 months using ournew configurable hardware and software platform developed for our FOXproducts.  We believe that these new coreproducts will increase our competitiveness in the Asian market and enable us toincrease market share in the rapidly growing segments for high power logicburn-in and massively parallel test and burn-in for [D-rams].  
In closing we continue to be encouraged by the bookings wepotentially see from our initial FOX-1 customer and the opportunities we haveto add additional customers for our FOX products over the long term.  Based on our strong backlog of orders for ourFOX-1 parallel testers and WaferPak contactors we expect to grow both revenueand net profit in our third fiscal quarter when compared to the quarter justreported.  
Now, I’d like to turn the call over the Garyand he’ll add some color to the second quarter financials.
Gary L. Larson
Net sales were $9.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal2008 an increase of 55% from $6.2 million in the second quarter fiscal 2007 andan increase of 26% from $7.7 million in the prior quarter.  In the second quarter of fiscal 2008 FOX-1systems and contactors represented the majority of our net sales.  As Rhea had mentioned earlier we shipped theFOX-15 system this quarter.  We expect torecord revenue for it upon completion of customer acceptance.

Gross margin was 50% for the second quarter compared with47% in the year ago quarter.  Grossmargin increased primarily because FOX products with somewhat higher marginsrepresented a higher portion of net sales. On a going forward basis we believe that the typical gross margin willbe about 50%.  
SG&A was $1.8 million in the second quarter comparedwith $1.5 million in the prior year period. The increase in SG&A dollars is primarily attributable to anincrease in headcount as we added support resources to address the expectedgrowth in our business.  
Second quarter 2008 R&D expense was $1.4 million down slightlyfrom $1.5 million in the second quarter of last year.  R&D expense varies fromquarter-to-quarter depending on product development expenses and this quarter’slevel was lower than is typical.  Weexpect R&D expense to increase somewhat during the second half of thisfiscal year as we add engineering resources to grow our custom WaferPakcontactor business.  
Income from operations for the second quarter of 2008 was$1.6 million compared to a loss from operations of $82,000 for the secondquarter of 2007.  Comparing this quarterto the same quarter of the prior year operating income increased by nearly $1.7million while sales were up $3.4 million. This demonstrates the leverage available to the company when sales aregrowing and product mix is shifting more towards FOX products.  
Our net income for the second quarter was $1.4 million or$0.16 per share compared with net income of $687,000 or $0.08 per share a yearago and compared to net income in the prior quarter of $779,000 or $0.09 pershare.  Excluding stock compensationexpense in these periods pro forma net income in the second quarter of fiscal2008 was $1.6 million or $0.19 per share compared with $856,000 or $0.10 pershare in the same period of the prior year and compared to $968,000 or [inaudible]in the prior quarter.  
Net sales were $17.3 million in the first six months offiscal 2008 compared with $13.4 million in the first six months of fiscal2007.  Net income for the six monthsended November 30, 2007 was $2.1 million or $0.26 per diluted share comparedwith net income of $1.2 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the same periodof the prior fiscal year.  
We continue to have a solid balance sheet.  Our cash, cash equivalent and short terminvestments stood at $6.9 million at November 30, 2007.  This total is $1.8 million lower than at theprior quarter end and results from the increase in accounts receivable duringthe second quarter.  Accounts receivablewas $11.6 million at the end of the second quarter a $4.8 million dollar increasefrom the end of the prior quarter.  Theincrease is primarily attributable to the higher levels of sales as well as anincrease in the level of receivables in Japanwhich typically has longer payment terms. 
Our inventory was $10.7 million at November 30, 2007essentially flat with inventories at the end of the prior quarter.  Shareholders’ equity was $26.6 million or$3.30 per share outstanding at November 30, 2007 and we continue to have nooutstanding debt.
We’re now ready to answer your questions.  Operator please go ahead.
Question-and-AnswerSession

Operator
We will now begin the question and answer session.  (Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from Ramesh Misrafrom Collins Stewart.  Please go ahead.
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
My first question Rhea was for you.  Can you qualitatively talk about what thebook to build or backlog number was?  Iknow you tend to report backlog normally at the end of the fiscal year but canyou at least give a directional indication?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Okay.  As you know wedon’t report bookings per quarter but we did announce $13 million worth of FOXsystem orders early in the quarter.

Gary L. Larson
We announced itearly in thequarter.
Rhea J. Posedel 
For the prior quarter and the quarter just finished.  In the second quarter we announced $13million worth of FOX system bookings and we also talked about receivingadditional WaferPak bookings for those systems. Obviously our book to build was higher than what we shipped but we don’treport bookings primarily because we have a very lumpy bookings per quarter andoften times a week or so can make a significant change in whether the bookingsis one and a half to one book to build or half depending on when the ordercomes in.  And often times our customer’sknow that and put pressure on us for discounts at the end of a quarter, youknow, book order.  So, by not reportingbookings it actually saves trying to accelerate bookings and giving additionaldiscounts.
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
You alluded to orders for the WaferPak for these 10 systemsthat you received orders for.  Typicallyhow many WaferPaks are ordered for each of the FOX-1 systems?
Rhea J. Posedel 
I would say somewhere from one and half to two.  
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Okay.  So, have youreceived WaferPaks for all of the systems that you received orders for?
Rhea J. Posedel 
They tend to delay them somewhat but, I don’t know wehaven’t tried to match them up.  
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
In terms of these systems, the $13 million order that youreceived by when do you expect it to be shipped?  So, I’m talking shipment not recognizingrevenues.
Rhea J. Posedel 
I think we would actually ship during this fiscal year.
Ramesh Misra – CollinsSteward LLC
So, by the end of May you should have it shipped?  If this is a repeat customer Rhea, would theacceptance cycle be shrunk?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Yes.
Gary L. Larson
Basically, on these repeat orders when the customer hasalready accepted the initial system then the revenue is recorded on shipmentfor the follow on unit.  
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
So basically it’s reasonable to expect that the revenues forthese 10 systems should be recognized also by the end of the current fiscalyear?
Gary L. Larson
Yep.
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Now shifting again to thewafer related to thecomplexity of theparts or ASPs, they’re actually decline?
Rhea J. Posedel 
That’s agood question.  I would saythe ASPs – let’s saythe selling price canvary anywhere from $200,000 to $500,000. I think a goodrule of thumb would bearound $300,000 conservatively.  
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Okay.
Rhea J. Posedel 
And to answer your other question itis going up a littlebit as we see waferswith more die on them.  Then, weobviously have ahigher number of pins and theselling price increased because theselling prices is based on thenumber of contacts or thenumber of pins we provide.  
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Now clearly one of the issues you had previously Rhea wasthe ability to supply enough WaferPaks. Can you talk about how you resolved that or how far are you along in theprocess of resolving that?
Rhea J. Posedel 
As I mentioned inthe conference callscript designing and producing WaferPaks is amajor challenge.  I think initially whenwe started this project we were selling 200mm FOX-1 and 200mm WaferPaks and Ithink we’ve been able to overcome delivers on the200mm at least most ofthem and now we’re facing thechallenge of developing or designing 300mm WaferPaks.  And, as I mentioned we’ve invested alot in design tools inorder to reduce our cycle times.  So,it’s a lengthy processbut we feel we’re making good progress on that. 
Ramesh Misra – CollinsSteward LLC
Related to the delivery of the FOX-1 systems.  Obviously, the customer wouldn’t want thesystem to be sitting there without WaferPaks. Do you have the capability to supply the contactors as well by the timethese systems are delivered before the end of the fiscal year?

Rhea J. Posedel 
I believe so.  
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Okay.
Rhea J. Posedel 
I think historically they tend to buy more WaferPaks thanthey have systems for.  
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Right.
Rhea J. Posedel 
We will have enough WaferPaks we believe for our installedbasis systems.  
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
And again, this entire order was for 300mm tools soclearly all of theWaferPaks are 300mm
Rhea J. Posedel 
Yes.  Currently thenew WaferPaks are 300mm.
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Shifting gears a little but your R&D expense I recognizethe fact that year-over-year was down actually I think the lowest level thatits ever been in the last four quarters or so. Obviously, there’s a lot ofvariation in it but does this reflect the conclusion of any particular projectyou might have been working on?
Gary L. Larson
Well, there are always projects that are ongoing and projects that are comingcloser to fruition.  What this shows isthat a number of expenses that would have more recently showed up in R&Dexpenses were showing up in inventory and costs of goods and that’s because aproduct has reached a point of maturity where we’re allowed to do that by theaccounting rules.  And, that was mycomment about variations from quarter-to-quarter.  You will see ups and downs in particularly inthe R&D expense arena we’ll have substantial material expenses that willshow up in R&D expense and then in another quarter just as we saw this timearound those similar expenses may be counted as inventory or cost of goodsbased on the nature of that particular product.
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Okay.  And just aclarification on that comment about second half R&D expense.  Are you suggesting that it just goes back tothe historical level that it has been? Or, do you think the second half will actually be modestly high than arolling quarter average R&D expenditure has been?
Gary L. Larson
Well definitely higher than the quarter just ended.  That was the message we were trying tosend.  But, as you point out since we aregearing up on the WaferPak contactors in a way we haven’t before it wouldn’t besurprising if we saw the R&D expense go higher than the recentaverages.  
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
That helps.  Inregards to the tax rate this quarter’s tax rate was about 10% or so Gary.  How should we think of tax rate goingforward?  I know its difficult to predictthat with a fine degree of precision but all the same its been running a lotlower than previously and I believe you might – some of your NOLs might becoming to an end.  So, how should wethink of tax rate going forward?
Gary L. Larson
I would say that the best thing you can do at this point isto assume similar rates to what you’ve seen us booking in the first and secondquarter of this fiscal year.  You’reright we do have NOLs in the US andNOLS in Japan.  Some of those NOLs in Japanare going to be completely consumed this year resulting in a higher effectivetax rate and that’s what we’re trying to reflect.  It will depend on how the business plays outbetween the US, Japanand our other subsidiaries what the ultimate rate may be.  But, I would say looking at the rates webooked in Q1 and Q2 would be the best way to estimate it at this point.  
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Looking at these revenues Rhea, can you give us a sense ofhow much of it came from the FOX systems and how much came from your legacy MAXand MTS systems?
Gary L. Larson
In the conference call I mentioned that the majority of ourbusiness did come from FOX products this quarter.
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Can you give us any indication of what’s happening on thelegacy side further down the line? Clearly there is a slowdown in overall cap ex spending in the industryso do you anticipate that your legacy business will remain subdued on accountof that?

Rhea J. Posedel 
You’re correct in that we’re seeing certainly the capacitybias aren’t there for core products for burn-in and parallel test.  And, this is why we’re taking a proactiveapproach to enhance and roll out new products that allows us to compete in somenew market places for our MAX and MTX. We believe we can – certainly we talked about rolling them out the nextsix to 12 months and we think these new products should start having revenueagain in the next fiscal year.  
Ramesh Misra – Collins Steward LLC
So these are redesigned MAX and MTX systems?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Right.  They would bea next generation MAX or a next generation MTX using the core hardware softwarethat we developed for our FOX products. So we will migrate that technology to our MAX and MTX.
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Okay.  Again, kind oftrying to look at it more finely do you anticipate the FOX-1 revenues to bealso up in the February quarter?
Gary L. Larson
On a quarter-to-quarter basis?
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Yes.
Gary L. Larson
We haven’t given that guidance.  But, we are expecting revenue to be up on aquarter-to-quarter basis but we’re not breaking that guidance down by product.
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
I think that covers most of my questions for now.  Thank you gentlemen.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Wilkinson from LewisAsset Management.  Please go ahead.
Brian Wilkinson –Lewis Asset Management
I think Ramesh covered most of what I was thinkingabout.  I was just going to ask about theaddressable market in general how much of that $3 billion probe carb market?
Rhea J. Posedel 
I’d say it was a wafer probe test market.
Brian Wilkinson –Lewis Asset Management
How much do you cover currently with products that you haveto market and the customers and perspective customers that you’re touchingright now?  What’s the addressable – yourpart of it?
Rhea J. Posedel 
We provide in our financial picture a company estimate ofwhat we believe our segment for FOX products is and we estimate it to be about$250 million by the year 2009.
Brian Wilkinson –Lewis Asset Management
By the year 2009?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Calendar 2009.
Brian Wilkinson –Lewis Asset Management
And what are you right now for 08?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Say it again?
Brian Wilkinson –Lewis Asset Management
What’s the current addressable market?  How much for 08?
Rhea J. Posedel 
What we’re saying for calendar 08 would be somewhere around$140 million, $120 million.
Brian Wilkinson –Lewis Asset Management
But double that by next year this time?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Correct.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jeffery Scott from Scott AssetManagement.  Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
FOX-1 you said on the technology side you still have a wayto go.  Can you explain what problemsneed to be resolved?
Rhea J. Posedel 
I meant on the WaferPak, reducing the cycle time from whenwe get the order until when we deliver it.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
So, the production technology is okay it’s just a questionof the turnaround time?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Correct.  When westarted developing WaferPaks initially it took us months and months to designit which is too long and then we had to shorten that design phase where thecustomers expecting deliveries in say three months.  We need to get down to that level two to threemonths.  So, our delivery lead times aretoo long.  
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
The FOX-15 customer is that a new customer to Aehr Test?
Rhea J. Posedel 
No, it’s a customer that we had sold MAX products to.  It’s a new customer for FOX but it’s acustomer we had sold MAX.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
Everything’s a new customer for FOX.
Rhea J. Posedel 
That’s correct.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
So, they new you via the old legacy MAX product?

Rhea J. Posedel 
That’s correct.  So,that’s how we had the relationship and that’s how we basically got in and wereable to sell them on our FOX technology.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
And these have been delivered to a USdomestic location?
Rhea J. Posedel 
No, I didn’t say that.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
Okay.
Rhea J. Posedel 
I would say its an international location.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
Okay.  How manysystems could this particular customer order?
Rhea J. Posedel 
When we talked to them initially he was saying somewherebetween five and 10 over a number of years of course.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
Somewhere between five and 10.  You still have just the order for one, right?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Correct.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
So five to 10 would be over some period of time?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Correct.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
What do you think you have to do to get the customer toorder more?
Rhea J. Posedel 
As I highlighted in the conference call I think what he islooking for is a system that offers the reliability and the repeatability thathe needs to ensure that he meets his customer’s stringent requirements forwafer level burn-in.  So, he’s a verydetailed customer.  I mean, certainly wecan do the job but he wants to see 100% of his wafers work every time andthat’s the challenge that we have to get towards.  We have to give him a high confidence that wecan get some high yields when he processes wafers.  The only way you’re going to do that is torun multiple wafers and see what the issues are and if there are any then fixthem.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
Are you expecting significant issues?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Yeah I guess you always expect there to be issues but you’realways hoping for the best.  So, you haveto be prepared to deal with some of these issues.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
Okay.  The five to 10over time those will be delivered to the same location the first one went to?
Rhea J. Posedel 
Yes.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
Are there other locations?
Rhea J. Posedel 
No, this customer just has one location.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
Just one location.
Rhea J. Posedel 
What would have to also happen is heprobably would need to – as headds more devices.  So, this is onedevice type so thisone device type is maybe one or two systems and as headds more device types itcould be moresystems.  But, again I think theleverage here could bethat the end customeris a leading carmanufacturer and if that carmanufacturer likes thewafer technology and if itprovides them with reliable quality die then our hope is that they require someof their IC suppliers to use our FOX product. So, that’s where thebig leverage couldbe.  If we can besuccessful in thisproject.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
That would actually play out over some number of years wouldit not?
Rhea J. Posedel 
That’s correct.  But,that would broaden our customer base instead of one customer it could bemultiple customers who would be interested in our FOX product.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
All driven by the success.
Rhea J. Posedel 
Of this one large – as you know there’s only a few largeautomotive companies in the world.  
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
You talked about theFOX-15 having applications for other people that were inthe known good diebusiness.  What other, other than autoswould you characterize this as being in?
Rhea J. Posedel 
One customer that we’re talking with is aDRAM customer and they’re looking atselling their DRAM chip into astack package that goes into handheld communication devices.  That’s avery broad application soit’s stack packages, vertical stack packages for thehandheld consumer market.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management

Is that something that would play out over a shorter periodof time?
Rhea J. Posedel 
If we’re successful with that customer that could happenwithin the next 12 months.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
You still have a goal of one new customer for FOX-1 and onenew customer for FOX-15, right?
Rhea J. Posedel 
That is correct.  Ormore.
Jeffrey Scott – ScottAsset Management
Have you been able to – are you more hopeful now than youwere three months ago that you’ve found that particular new customer?
Rhea J. Posedel 
I think shipping the FOX-15 certainly helps on the waferlevel burn-in front because it really validates that our technology works andcertainly reduces barriers that prevent people from buying these kinds ofproducts.  And, on the FOX-1 side I thinkwe’ve come closer to selling a few customers. So, yeah I think we’re further than three months ago.
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our next question is a follow up from Ramesh Misra.  Please go ahead.
Ramesh Misra –Collins Steward LLC
Just a quick clarification. You previously talked about the burn in system has being FOX-14.  Is the FOX-15 just a slightly modifiedversion with one additional slot or are there some additional fundamentalchanges because I know you had shown the FOX-15 at the show in July last yearnot the FOX-14.
Rhea J. Posedel 
I think initially when we sold the order to our automotiveIC manufacturer it was a FOX-14 system which was our first generation waferlevel burn-in and test system.  And, aswe got further into the project we decided to basically upgrade the technology,hardware software taking it from the FOX-1 and using that hardware softwareplatform and at the same time we also added one additional wafer slot.  But, not only is it a 15 slot system butbasically it’s almost from a ground up everything is new and enhanced from ourFOX-14 system.  So, it truly is a nextgeneration wafer level burn-in and test system from the ground up.
Operator
Our next question comes from Larry Brooks from MaloneySecurities.  Please go ahead.
Larry Brooks –Maloney Securities
I’m wondering the approximate value for a sale on a FOX-15what that would go for?
Rhea J. Posedel 
If you looked at the system and the 15 wafer pack contactorsit would be in excess of $2 million.
Larry Brooks –Maloney Securities
With the current products that you are manufacturing are youhaving any supply issues and problems getting the components that you need tomake the products?
Rhea J. Posedel 
I don’t think any more than we would on the MAX or theMTX.  I think we have hired a new VP ofoperations Joel Bustos and I think he’s certainly strengthened the supplychain.  So, I think we see less issues onthe material side.
Larry Brooks –Maloney Securities
You of course talked about your account receivables and itof course being a Japanese company, is this a new group that you’re dealingwith or is this someone that you’ve dealt with before?
Gary L. Larson
No, we’ve dealt with this customer before.
Larry Brooks –Maloney Securities
Okay.  So logicallyyou don’t expect to see any problems?
Gary L. Larson
No.
Larry Brooks –Maloney Securities
I guess the last thing is the seasonality of yourcompany.  are you seeing any issues whereone quarter is generally stronger than another?
Rhea J. Posedel 
I can’t see over the 30 years that we’ve been in busy thatthere’s been any seasonality.  It variesmore I guess with the ups and downs of the semiconductor industry.
Operator
At this time we have no further questions in queue.  I would like to send the conference back tomanagement for any concluding comments. Please go ahead.
Rhea J. Posedel 
I’d like to thank you for joining us this afternoon and welook forward to next quarter’s conference call. Thanks again.
