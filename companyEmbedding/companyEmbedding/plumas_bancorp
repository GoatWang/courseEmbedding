QUINCY, Calif., July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plumas Bancorp (NASDAQ:PLBC), the parent company of Plumas Bank, today announced record earnings during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. Earnings during the second quarter of 2017 totaled $2.5 million or $0.51 per share, an increase of $704 thousand from $1.8 million or $0.38 per share during the second quarter of 2016. The second quarter earnings of $2.5 million represent the highest level of earnings for any quarter in the history of Plumas Bancorp (the "Company").  Diluted earnings per share increased to $0.49 per share during the three months ended June 30, 2017 from $0.36 per share during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company reported net income of $4.6 million or $0.93 per share, an increase of $1.2 million, or 35%, from $3.4 million or 0.70 per share earned during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Earnings per diluted share increased to $0.89 during the six months ended June 30, 2017 up $0.22 from $0.67 during the first six months of 2016.
"On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am very pleased to report excellent results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017.  Significant highlights include: record earnings; record levels of assets; loans and deposits; a 4.51% net interest margin for the second quarter; and a 52.8% efficiency ratio," commented Andrew J. Ryback, director, president and chief executive officer of Plumas Bancorp and Plumas Bank.  Ryback continued, "These accomplishments are the result of strategic investments in both technology for operational efficiencies as well as platforms to expand our deposit gathering capabilities, a highly productive and diversified lending operation, deliberate expense containment, and further building of our non-interest income streams.  Additionally, we continue to monitor the competitive landscape and look for opportunities for investment and growth.  Our strict attention to both return on investment and expense control will ensure that we have the necessary capital to execute our long-term strategic plan and continue to produce growth and strong returns."
Ryback added, "On May 15, 2017 we paid a semi-annual $0.14 per share common stock dividend.  This represents a $0.04 increase from the $0.10 dividend paid on November 21, 2016 and is reflective of our directors' desire to provide cash to shareholders, while at the same time retaining an appropriate level of capital to fund the Bank's ongoing growth." 
Ryback concluded, "I am confident that we will continue to perform well throughout 2017 and, as always, we appreciate the support of our shareholders, clients and personnel."

Nonperforming assets (which are comprised of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned ("OREO") and repossessed vehicle holdings) at June 30, 2017 were $3.8 million, down from $5.8 million at June 30, 2016.  Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 0.54% at June 30, 2017 down from 0.96% at June 30, 2016.

During the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $400 thousand. Net charge-offs totaled $94 thousand and $48 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses totaled $6.9 million at June 30, 2017 and $6.4 million at June 30, 2016. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.49% at June 30, 2016 to 1.44% at June 30, 2017.
Shareholders' Equity 
Total shareholders' equity increased by $6.5 million from $46.4 million at June 30, 2016 to $52.9 million at June 30, 2017. The $6.5 million includes earnings during the twelve month period totaling $8.7 million and stock option activity totaling $0.4 million. These items were partially offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on investment securities of $1.4 million, a $0.10 per share cash dividend, paid in November 2016 and a $0.14 per share cash dividend paid in May 2017.  The two cash dividends totaled $1.2 million.
In May, 2017 the Company's outstanding warrant, which represented the right to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock at $5.25 per share, was exercised in a cashless exercise resulting in the issuance of 108,111 common shares.  
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $6.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $1.1 million, or 18%, from $5.8 million for the same period in 2016.  The increase in net interest income includes an increase of $1 million in interest income; the largest component of which was an increase in interest and fees on loans of $880 thousand. This increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances of $50.8 million and an increase in yield on loans of 16 basis points from 5.32% during the 2016 quarter to 5.48% during the current quarter. We attribute this increase in yield primarily to an increase in the prime interest rate as well as a decrease in net loan costs of $103 thousand. Interest expense declined by $3 thousand related to a decline in the average balance of the Plumas Bancorp's note payable from $3.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $470 thousand during the current quarter. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased 25 basis points to 4.51%, up from 4.26% for the same period in 2016.
Net interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $13.4 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the $11.6 million earned during the same period in 2016. Driven mostly by an increase in average loan balances, interest income increased by $1.8 million while interest expense, which benefited from the payoff of the Bancorp's note payable in April of 2017, declined by $7 thousand.   Net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased 18 basis points to 4.41%, up from 4.23% for the same period in 2016.
Non-Interest Income/Expense
During the three months ended June 30, 2017, non-interest income totaled $2.4 million, an increase of $327 thousand from the three months ended June 30, 2016. The largest component of this increase was a $227 thousand increase in gains on sale of SBA loans from $559 thousand during the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $786 thousand during the current quarter. Proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $13.1 million during the current quarter and $9.0 million during the 2016 quarter.  Loans originated for sale totaled $8.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017 and $6.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016.  
During the six months ended June 30, 2017, non-interest income totaled $4.4 million, an increase of $723 thousand from the six months ended June 30, 2016. The largest component of this increase was a $422 thousand increase in gains on sale of SBA loans from $892 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $1.3 million during the current period. Proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $22.3 million during the current period and $15.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Loans originated for sale totaled $19.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and $14.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  In addition, service charge income increased by $208 thousand during the comparison period mostly related to an increase in interchange income on debit card transactions and an increase in service charges on deposit accounts.
During the three months ended June 30, 2017, total non-interest expense increased by $212 thousand, or 5%, to $4.9 million, up from $4.7 million for the comparable period in 2016. This increase was primarily related to an increase of $306 thousand in salary and benefit expense. Salary expense increased by $112 thousand to $2.2 million related to additions to staff and merit and promotion increases. Commission expense related to our SBA operations increased by $74 thousand consistent with the increase in SBA activity. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, total non-interest expense increased by $662 thousand to $10 million mostly related to a $625 thousand increase in salary and benefit expense. The three largest components of the increase were increases of $255 thousand in salary expense, $139 thousand in accrued bonus expense and $106 thousand in commissions.

LTDC Artistic Director Christin Hanna's Departures (world premiere) explores the challenges that face a relationship when confronted with fear of the unknown while not compromising an unwavering love and companionship.
Choreographer Kristina Berger's Threshold (2017, Boston), a work about the space and time between journeys. A liminal moment: the second part of a three-part ritual, where your previous self has been stripped but you have not yet taken on the new self.
The dancers who participate in the Festival's Young Dancers Workshop will also present an excerpt from Coppelia and an improvisational work created with Festival artists Constantine Baecher, Traci Finch and Christin Hanna.
About the Lake Tahoe Dance Collective
The Lake Tahoe Dance Collective's mission is to promote classical, modern and contemporary dance of the finest quality in the Lake Tahoe area through performance, education and outreach, enriching the community as a whole and as a cultural destination.
About Artistic Director Christin Hanna
Christin Hanna trained with Margaret Banks at Nevada Festival Ballet and performed in the company's productions throughout her young life, continuing her studies at the Joffrey Ballet School and American Ballet Theater summer sessions in New York City.
Ms. Hanna enjoyed a busy freelance career, performing with Oakland Ballet, Ballet NY, and Cincinnati Ballet, and was a founding member of New Chamber Ballet. During her time there, she initiated a performance and summer workshop with area students in her hometown of Tahoe City in 2006.
Since her return to Tahoe in 2008, Hanna has produced over fifteen performances featuring over 50 works with more than 20 guest artists. She has staged works created on her at NCB as well as classics like Giselle, in addition to choreographing and serving as rehearsal assistant to visiting guest choreographers. She and longtime friend Constantine Baecher started the Lake Tahoe Dance Festival in 2013 and continue to collaborate on programming and artistic vision for Lake Tahoe Dance Collective.
Lake Tahoe Dance Festival is made possible in part through support from Tahoe Weekly and North Lake Tahoe. Additional support from North Lake Tahoe Historical Society, Tahoe Truckee Community Foundation, Queen of Hearts Women's Fund, Tahoe Art Haus & Cinema, Alpenglow Sports, Plumas Bank, Tahoe City Downtown Association, Trunk Show and Wolfdale's Cuisine Unique.

About SpecimensSpecimen Certificates are actual certificates that have never been issued. They were usually kept  by the printers in their permanent archives as their only example of a particular certificate.  Sometimes you will see a hand stamp on the certificate that says "Do not remove from file".Specimens were also used to show prospective clients different types of certificate designs that were available. Specimen certificates are usually much scarcer than issued certificates. In fact, many times they are the only way to get a certificate for a particular company because the issued certificates were redeemed and destroyed. In a few instances, Specimen certificates we made for a company but were never used because a different design was chosen by the company.These certificates are normally stamped "Specimen" or they have small holes spelling the word specimen. Most of the time they don't have a serial number, or they have a serial number of 00000. This is an exciting sector of the hobby that grown in popularity over the past several years.
