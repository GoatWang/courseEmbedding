Our Solutions Inspire You To Take Initiative with Confidence










Powered by theStudent Insights Engine™
Our Platform, Insights Engine and apps provide deep and broad institution-specific data and derived models that reflect the current and future state of your institution and your students. Working with this Platform and infrastructure, colleges and universities are dramatically improving student success.

 















 

  













iPASS: Integrated Planning and Advising for Student Success
Connect degree planning, advising, alerts and interventions to help students complete a certificate or degree.











Creating time and space for advisors and educators to work with students to build plans and overcome barriers helps more students successfully achieve their educational goals.
The Civitas Learning Student Success Platform equips students to select and schedule appropriate courses and alerts advisors and faculty of at-risk students so they can prioritize outreach. The applications also surface data-informed insights to administrators and front-line staff, providing additional context to personalize support, connect students with relevant resources and maximize students’ success.

Illuminated Pathways
Institutions and their students are struggling to find the most direct pathways to degree attainment. Civitas Learning is helping to shine a light on those pathways, while strengthening the symbiotic relationship between student demand and institution efficiency.











By surfacing key insights like which courses have the strongest connections to graduation for every degree offered at your institution and how course grade influences a student’s likelihood to graduate, Civitas Learning supports institutions’ efforts in thoughtful curricular design and pathway articulation. 
Clear and accessible degree planning, personalized guidance and smart scheduling enable students to stay on-track and institutions to forecast course demand. This continuous cycle of intentional student planning and effective institutional planning secures the foundation of any pathways initiative.

Smart Resource Allocation
Institutions everywhere are straining under initiative fatigue – too many programs requiring too many resources to sustain and too many unknowns to make critical decisions about efficacy and resource reallocation.











Civitas Learning enables institutions to know, with precision, which initiatives are working and for whom.  
Equipped with the ability to measure the impact of their efforts, institutions can now rally around important policy decisions, prioritize and coordinate efforts, appropriately support programs and guide students toward the ones that will work best for them. With Civitas Learning, speed and accuracy go hand-in-hand.

Student Empowerment
Today’s students don’t look like the four-year, full-time students of yesterday. One thing that remains the same however, is their desire to earn a degree that doesn’t bury them in debt and which prepares them for a rewarding career.











Civitas Learning is empowering students to make informed decisions about their future, create a plan for success and stick to it. Students understand the impacts of their degree choices, find clarity in a term-by-term course roadmap and easily balance life with their class schedule. 
Through timely and relevant outreach, institutions are strengthening relationships with students and reminding them that they are not alone on this journey.

“Our Degree Map project shows that when students have more clarity and control of their degree path, they’re significantly more likely to make progress on their learning path and, best of all, cross the finish line and complete a certificate or degree. These are the kinds of outcomes all of our student success innovations are shooting for!” 
 Richard Rhodes President and CEO, Austin Community College Austin Community College 







Transforming Advising
Austin Community College implemented Degree Map to transform advising and improve student completion. Read how adoption improved the advisor/student conversation, and gave students ownership of their degree pathways.
