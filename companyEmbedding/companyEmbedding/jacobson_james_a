Call us for a prepaid UPS label for your return. It’s as simple and easy as that. Most importantly, standing orders mean you will never have to worry about the timeliness of the information you’re relying on. And, you may discontinue standing orders at any time by contacting us at 1.800.960.1220 or by sending an email to books@bna.com.

James Jacobson  Esq. 
Nutter McClennen & Fish LLP




James M. Jacobson is a Partner in Nutter McClennen & Fish LLP's Business Department and serves as a member of the advisory board of Bloomberg BNA's Health Insurance Report. Mr. Jacobson's practice focuses on clients in the life sciences and health care industries, including pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, contract manufacturers, wholesale distributors, clinical research organizations, hospital systems, pharmacies, pharmaceutical benefits and disease managers, clinics, health plans and insurers, physician organizations, and long term care providers. He specializes in complex corporate, contractual, regulatory, and reimbursement transactions, including M&A, joint ventures, licensing, clinical trials, dispute resolution, and the full range of compliance and regulatory issues.
Mr. Jacobson joined Nutter from Fresenius Medical Care, one of world’s largest integrated health care services, pharmaceuticals and medical products companies, where he was associate general counsel, representing the pharmaceutical and medical device division on transactional, regulatory, legislative and reimbursement matters. In this position, he handled a wide range of FDA-regulated industry deals and issues, including commercial licensing and acquisition of drug and device products, clinical trials, government pricing, supply chain and distribution services, and managed care and PBM contracting. Mr. Jacobson also served as counsel to the company's nationwide laboratory and pharmacy businesses, and regularly advised the company's health care provider business units, including clinics, ACOs, disease managers, physicians, and other providers.
For more than 20 years, Mr. Jacobson has represented national and regional health care payors, providers and vendors as a health law partner at two other leading national law firms, serving practically all types of health care products and services stakeholders. During that time, Mr. Jacobson served as general or special counsel to many well-known industry associations, such as NCQA, URAC, AMA, AHA, AHIP, HDMA, AAPPO and ABC. 
Before entering private practice, Mr. Jacobson served as in-house counsel to the American Psychological Association and as a member of the Clinton White House Task Force on National Health Care Reform. 
Mr. Jacobson received his B.A., cum laude, from Yale University and his J.D. from Harvard Law School.
