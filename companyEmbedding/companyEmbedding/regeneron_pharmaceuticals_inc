Company history[edit]
Regeneron has two products in development based on aflibercept, a VEGF inhibitor, and rilonacept, an interleukin-1 blocker. VEGF is a protein that normally stimulates the growth of blood vessels, and interleukin-1 is a protein that is normally involved in inflammation. On March 26, 2012 Bloomberg announced that Sanofi and Regeneron are in development with a new cholesterol drug which will help reduce cholesterol up to 72% more than the leading brands. It is believed this new drug will greatly reduce heart disease in patients around the world. The medicine, one in a class of drugs targeting the PCSK9 gene, reduced patients’ average LDL cholesterol levels to as little as 34 milligrams per deciliter after 12 weeks in the mid- stage study, presented on March, 2012 at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago.[citation needed]
In July 2015, the company announced a new global collaboration with Sanofi to discover, develop, and commercialise new immuno-oncology drugs, which could generate more than $2 billion for Regeneron,[4] with $640 million upfront, $750 million for proof of concept data and $650 million from the development of REGN2810.[5]
Marketed products[edit]
EYLEA (aflibercept injection): Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2011.[3][6] EYLEA developed to treat a common cause of blindness in the elderly.
ARCALYST (rilonacept) for specific, rare autoinflammatory conditions. Approved by the FDA in February 2008.
ZALTRAP (aflibercept injection) for metastatic colorectal cancer: Approved by the FDA in August 2012.[7]
PRALUENT (Alirocumab) indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Approved by FDA on 24 July 2015 [8]
Technology platforms[edit]
Trap Fusion Proteins: Regeneron’s novel and patented Trap technology creates high-affinity product candidates for many types of signaling molecules, including growth factors and cytokines. The Trap technology involves fusing two distinct fully human receptor components and a fully human immunoglobulin-G constant region.
Fully Human Monoclonal Antibodies: Regeneron has developed a suite (VelociSuite) of patented technologies, including VelocImmune and VelociMab, that allow Regeneron scientists to determine the best targets for therapeutic intervention and rapidly generate high-quality, fully human antibodies drug candidates addressing these targets.[9]:255-258

Company history[edit]
Regeneron has two products in development based on aflibercept, a VEGF inhibitor, and rilonacept, an interleukin-1 blocker. VEGF is a protein that normally stimulates the growth of blood vessels, and interleukin-1 is a protein that is normally involved in inflammation. On March 26, 2012 Bloomberg announced that Sanofi and Regeneron are in development with a new cholesterol drug which will help reduce cholesterol up to 72% more than the leading brands. It is believed this new drug will greatly reduce heart disease in patients around the world. The medicine, one in a class of drugs targeting the PCSK9 gene, reduced patients’ average LDL cholesterol levels to as little as 34 milligrams per deciliter after 12 weeks in the mid- stage study, presented on March, 2012 at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago.[citation needed]
In July 2015, the company announced a new global collaboration with Sanofi to discover, develop, and commercialise new immuno-oncology drugs, which could generate more than $2 billion for Regeneron,[4] with $640 million upfront, $750 million for proof of concept data and $650 million from the development of REGN2810.[5]
Marketed products[edit]
EYLEA (aflibercept injection): Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2011.[3][6] EYLEA developed to treat a common cause of blindness in the elderly.
ARCALYST (rilonacept) for specific, rare autoinflammatory conditions. Approved by the FDA in February 2008.
ZALTRAP (aflibercept injection) for metastatic colorectal cancer: Approved by the FDA in August 2012.[7]
PRALUENT (Alirocumab) indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Approved by FDA on 24 July 2015 [8]
Technology platforms[edit]
Trap Fusion Proteins: Regeneron’s novel and patented Trap technology creates high-affinity product candidates for many types of signaling molecules, including growth factors and cytokines. The Trap technology involves fusing two distinct fully human receptor components and a fully human immunoglobulin-G constant region.
Fully Human Monoclonal Antibodies: Regeneron has developed a suite (VelociSuite) of patented technologies, including VelocImmune and VelociMab, that allow Regeneron scientists to determine the best targets for therapeutic intervention and rapidly generate high-quality, fully human antibodies drug candidates addressing these targets.[9]:255-258

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Company history[edit]
Regeneron has two products in development based on aflibercept, a VEGF inhibitor, and rilonacept, an interleukin-1 blocker. VEGF is a protein that normally stimulates the growth of blood vessels, and interleukin-1 is a protein that is normally involved in inflammation. On March 26, 2012 Bloomberg announced that Sanofi and Regeneron are in development with a new cholesterol drug which will help reduce cholesterol up to 72% more than the leading brands. It is believed this new drug will greatly reduce heart disease in patients around the world. The medicine, one in a class of drugs targeting the PCSK9 gene, reduced patients’ average LDL cholesterol levels to as little as 34 milligrams per deciliter after 12 weeks in the mid- stage study, presented on March, 2012 at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago.[citation needed]
In July 2015, the company announced a new global collaboration with Sanofi to discover, develop, and commercialise new immuno-oncology drugs, which could generate more than $2 billion for Regeneron,[4] with $640 million upfront, $750 million for proof of concept data and $650 million from the development of REGN2810.[5]
Marketed products[edit]
EYLEA (aflibercept injection): Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2011.[3][6] EYLEA developed to treat a common cause of blindness in the elderly.
ARCALYST (rilonacept) for specific, rare autoinflammatory conditions. Approved by the FDA in February 2008.
ZALTRAP (aflibercept injection) for metastatic colorectal cancer: Approved by the FDA in August 2012.[7]
PRALUENT (Alirocumab) indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Approved by FDA on 24 July 2015 [8]
Technology platforms[edit]
Trap Fusion Proteins: Regeneron’s novel and patented Trap technology creates high-affinity product candidates for many types of signaling molecules, including growth factors and cytokines. The Trap technology involves fusing two distinct fully human receptor components and a fully human immunoglobulin-G constant region.
Fully Human Monoclonal Antibodies: Regeneron has developed a suite (VelociSuite) of patented technologies, including VelocImmune and VelociMab, that allow Regeneron scientists to determine the best targets for therapeutic intervention and rapidly generate high-quality, fully human antibodies drug candidates addressing these targets.[9]:255-258

Company history[edit]
Regeneron has two products in development based on aflibercept, a VEGF inhibitor, and rilonacept, an interleukin-1 blocker. VEGF is a protein that normally stimulates the growth of blood vessels, and interleukin-1 is a protein that is normally involved in inflammation. On March 26, 2012 Bloomberg announced that Sanofi and Regeneron are in development with a new cholesterol drug which will help reduce cholesterol up to 72% more than the leading brands. It is believed this new drug will greatly reduce heart disease in patients around the world. The medicine, one in a class of drugs targeting the PCSK9 gene, reduced patients’ average LDL cholesterol levels to as little as 34 milligrams per deciliter after 12 weeks in the mid- stage study, presented on March, 2012 at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago.[citation needed]
In July 2015, the company announced a new global collaboration with Sanofi to discover, develop, and commercialise new immuno-oncology drugs, which could generate more than $2 billion for Regeneron,[4] with $640 million upfront, $750 million for proof of concept data and $650 million from the development of REGN2810.[5]
Marketed products[edit]
EYLEA (aflibercept injection): Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2011.[3][6] EYLEA developed to treat a common cause of blindness in the elderly.
ARCALYST (rilonacept) for specific, rare autoinflammatory conditions. Approved by the FDA in February 2008.
ZALTRAP (aflibercept injection) for metastatic colorectal cancer: Approved by the FDA in August 2012.[7]
PRALUENT (Alirocumab) indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Approved by FDA on 24 July 2015 [8]
Technology platforms[edit]
Trap Fusion Proteins: Regeneron’s novel and patented Trap technology creates high-affinity product candidates for many types of signaling molecules, including growth factors and cytokines. The Trap technology involves fusing two distinct fully human receptor components and a fully human immunoglobulin-G constant region.
Fully Human Monoclonal Antibodies: Regeneron has developed a suite (VelociSuite) of patented technologies, including VelocImmune and VelociMab, that allow Regeneron scientists to determine the best targets for therapeutic intervention and rapidly generate high-quality, fully human antibodies drug candidates addressing these targets.[9]:255-258

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
