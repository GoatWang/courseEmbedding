European Patent EP1076872B1, Germany Patent DE69903805D1
Abstract

A system collects information associated with movement between locations. The system includes individual cards. Each individual card has a storage area and an interactor for receiving promotional unit data. A plurality of promotional units are also included. Each promotional unit transmits respective promotional unit data to any card with which it interacts.

Vehicle customization, restriction, and data logging

Kenneth Alan Goldman, Charles Campbell Palmer, Elaine Rivette Palmer

US Patent 6,430,488
Abstract

A method, article of manufacture and computer product is presented for a vehicle customization, restriction, and data logging capability. The invention leverages the increasing electronic content in vehicles by interconnecting these electronic devices with a controller. It further uses a storage device in the vehicle, to store vehicle customizations and/or restrictions, and to provide capability for defining and logging significant vehicle events. Combining the electronic vehicle components with a storage device (sometimes in the form of a smart card or floppy disk, etc.) and a controller in a vehicle network enables providing operator specific settings for each of a set of vehicle operators. These customizations add to operator and passenger comfort and safety. It also enables application of setting restrictions to and logging the vehicles use parameters. These add previously unavailable tools to entities as diverse as a parent monitoring a teen driver, a company or government agency regulating a truck driver, an operator training facility, a vessel captain or pilot, a rental car company setting terms for a car rental and handling returns off line, and a car owner relinquishing the vehicle to a parking lot attendant.
