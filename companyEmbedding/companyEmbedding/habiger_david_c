He emphasizes engineering excellence and empowering the engineers in an organization.[6] Since its IPO, the company generated over $1.5 billion in revenue in the digital media category and has been named one of Forbes, Fortune and Business Week’s Fastest Growing Companies on multiple occasions.[7][8] Sonic opened the NASDAQ market in 2008[9] and 2010.[10] Habiger in 2011 sold Sonic to Rovi Corporation (NASDAQ: ROVI) and later that year was appointed as NDS Chief Executive Officer.[11][12] Shortly after filing with the SEC for its NYSE-listed IPO, Habiger announced the sale of NDS to Cisco for $5 billion; the sale was closed in the second half of 2012.[13] He is founder and partner at Silicon Media Partners.

Habiger is a member of the RealD (NASDAQ: RLD) board.[29] He is a member of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

          See you in New York!
