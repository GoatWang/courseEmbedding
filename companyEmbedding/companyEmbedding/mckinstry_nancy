Education[edit]
She holds an MBA (Finance & Marketing) from Columbia Business School, a bachelor's degree in economics from University of Rhode Island (Phi Beta Kappa), and received a Doctor of Laws (honorary) from University of Rhode Island.[3]
Early career[edit]
Early in her career, McKinstry held management positions with Booz & Company (formerly Booz Allen Hamilton, currently known as Strategy&), an international management-consulting firm, where she focused on assignments in the media and technology industries. In 1999, McKinstry worked as CEO of SCP Communications, a medical information company, before rejoining Wolters Kluwer to head its North American operations.
Wolters Kluwer[edit]
Before becoming a CEO of Wolters Kluwer in 2003, McKinstry was chief executive of the company’s North American operations and had held a range of senior positions at subsidiaries, including chief executive of CCH Legal Information Services, now a part of Wolters Kluwer’s Legal & Regulatory division.[4] Earlier, McKinstry held product management positions with CCH INCORPORATED, now part of Wolters Kluwer’sTax & Accounting division.[5] She is both the Dutch company’s first American and first female chief executive. She has praised her board’s “courage” in making the appointment and credits her deep group experience in helping with “the transformation from print to digital … as quickly as possible”.[6] Today three-quarters of Wolters Kluwer's revenue comes from online or electronic products, up from 71 percent in 2011, and 49 percent when the transition from print was launched at the end of 2008.[7]
McKinstry is not a fan of quotas,[8] but considers diversity a priority for the company. Currently Wolters Kluwer has 28% female executives (in 2003, only 20% had top leadership posts), 43% female managers, and 54% female employees.[9] "In my experience it's key to have strong diversity at the middle management level because that is really what you draw on as you look to fill executive positions. If you don't have enough diversity at that level it's very difficult to be able to really get diversity at the most senior levels."[10] She takes a hands on approach to making sure women are rising to the top, “We’ve been able to attract female talent because they see women leading different parts of the company. Diversity helps, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.”[11]
Wolters Kluwer has a talent management program which identifies high potential executives, "We specifically work on programs to provide them with the right experience to ensure they're developing the kind of leadership skills that they would need to get to the top of the organization."[12] Today many of the company's key businesses are run by women. Two of the largest divisions have female CEO's - Karen Abramson, CEO for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting[13] and Stacey Caywood, CEO of Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory[14] Shasha Chang is the Chief Executive Officer of Wolters Kluwer China since June 2009,[15] overseeing all Wolters Kluwer activities in greater China, one of the key growth markets for the company. "In some companies, women tend to take on functional roles but at Wolters Kluwer, women have responsibility for a P&L. You have to have that kind of experience and track record if you eventually want to aspire to be a CEO of a company or to sit as a non-executive director of a multi-national," McKinstry says.[16]
Innovation is the key to Wolters Kluwer's success. That’s why the company invests 8-10% of its annual revenues in new product developments and encourages employees to bring forward innovative ideas.[17] In 2012 McKinstry instituted a company-wide innovation contest to spur thought leadership, which also allows her to review the pool of talent, including women.[18]
Boards and honors[edit]
Nancy McKinstry is a member of the Boards of Directors of Sanoma Oyj and Abbott. She is also a member of the Advisory Council of the Amsterdam Institute of Finance, the Advisory Board for the University of Rhode Island, the Advisory Board of the Harrington School of Communication and Media, and the Board of Overseers of Columbia Business School. In August 2011, she was appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee, given her astute business leadership and long-standing expertise in the information and publishing industry.[19]
In 2012 McKinstry was ranked number 15 on Fortune’s Global 50 Most Powerful Women in Business(and 13 in 2011.)[20] She has been in the top 10 on this list in 2004, 2005, and 2006.[21] She has been among the Financial Times’ Top 50 Women in World Business for several consecutive years, being listed at number 17 most recently in 2011.[22] In 2009 McKinstry was ranked number 43 on the Forbes list of 100 Most Powerful Women, on which she represented one of the two women from the Netherlands (the other being Neelie Kroes).[23] In August 2011, she has been appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Nancy McKinstry is married and has two children, a son and a daughter. Her husband, an anesthesiologist, now splits his time between his job in New York and staying home with their children in the Netherlands.[25]

If you don't have enough diversity at that level it's very difficult to be able to really get diversity at the most senior levels."[10] She takes a hands on approach to making sure women are rising to the top, “We’ve been able to attract female talent because they see women leading different parts of the company. Diversity helps, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.”[11]
Wolters Kluwer has a talent management program which identifies high potential executives, "We specifically work on programs to provide them with the right experience to ensure they're developing the kind of leadership skills that they would need to get to the top of the organization."[12] Today many of the company's key businesses are run by women. Two of the largest divisions have female CEO's - Karen Abramson, CEO for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting[13] and Stacey Caywood, CEO of Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory[14] Shasha Chang is the Chief Executive Officer of Wolters Kluwer China since June 2009,[15] overseeing all Wolters Kluwer activities in greater China, one of the key growth markets for the company. "In some companies, women tend to take on functional roles but at Wolters Kluwer, women have responsibility for a P&L. You have to have that kind of experience and track record if you eventually want to aspire to be a CEO of a company or to sit as a non-executive director of a multi-national," McKinstry says.[16]
Innovation is the key to Wolters Kluwer's success. That’s why the company invests 8-10% of its annual revenues in new product developments and encourages employees to bring forward innovative ideas.[17] In 2012 McKinstry instituted a company-wide innovation contest to spur thought leadership, which also allows her to review the pool of talent, including women.[18]

Nancy McKinstry is a member of the Boards of Directors of Sanoma Oyj and Abbott. She is also a member of the Advisory Council of the Amsterdam Institute of Finance, the Advisory Board for the University of Rhode Island, the Advisory Board of the Harrington School of Communication and Media, and the Board of Overseers of Columbia Business School. In August 2011, she was appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee, given her astute business leadership and long-standing expertise in the information and publishing industry.[19]
In 2012 McKinstry was ranked number 15 on Fortune’s Global 50 Most Powerful Women in Business(and 13 in 2011.)[20] She has been in the top 10 on this list in 2004, 2005, and 2006.[21] She has been among the Financial Times’ Top 50 Women in World Business for several consecutive years, being listed at number 17 most recently in 2011.[22] In 2009 McKinstry was ranked number 43 on the Forbes list of 100 Most Powerful Women, on which she represented one of the two women from the Netherlands (the other being Neelie Kroes).[23] In August 2011, she has been appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee.[24]

Education[edit]
She holds an MBA (Finance & Marketing) from Columbia Business School, a bachelor's degree in economics from University of Rhode Island (Phi Beta Kappa), and received a Doctor of Laws (honorary) from University of Rhode Island.[3]
Early career[edit]
Early in her career, McKinstry held management positions with Booz & Company (formerly Booz Allen Hamilton, currently known as Strategy&), an international management-consulting firm, where she focused on assignments in the media and technology industries. In 1999, McKinstry worked as CEO of SCP Communications, a medical information company, before rejoining Wolters Kluwer to head its North American operations.
Wolters Kluwer[edit]
Before becoming a CEO of Wolters Kluwer in 2003, McKinstry was chief executive of the company’s North American operations and had held a range of senior positions at subsidiaries, including chief executive of CCH Legal Information Services, now a part of Wolters Kluwer’s Legal & Regulatory division.[4] Earlier, McKinstry held product management positions with CCH INCORPORATED, now part of Wolters Kluwer’sTax & Accounting division.[5] She is both the Dutch company’s first American and first female chief executive. She has praised her board’s “courage” in making the appointment and credits her deep group experience in helping with “the transformation from print to digital … as quickly as possible”.[6] Today three-quarters of Wolters Kluwer's revenue comes from online or electronic products, up from 71 percent in 2011, and 49 percent when the transition from print was launched at the end of 2008.[7]
McKinstry is not a fan of quotas,[8] but considers diversity a priority for the company.

Nancy McKinstry CEO, Wolters Kluwer Nancy McKinstry Delivers Transformative Results
The first female and the first non-Dutch CEO of Wolters Kluwer discusses what it took for a publishing giant to succeed in the digital age.
by Jen Swetzoff
As a college student at the University of Rhode Island (URI), Nancy McKinstry dreamed of becoming a foreign service officer. But languages didn’t come as naturally to her as numbers did — and so she began focusing on business. That move turned out to be good news for Wolters Kluwer, the global information services company that McKinstry now leads.
Named CEO in 2003, when she was just 45, McKinstry has spent the past 12 years transforming what was predominantly a European publishing house into a global IT solutions company. Today, Wolters Kluwer operates in more than 180 countries, providing information, software tools, and workflow solutions for professional customers in healthcare, legal, tax, and financial services.
McKinstry has worked at the intersection of communications and technology for most of her career. After graduating from URI with her BA in economics and political science, she took a job with the New England Telephone Company in Boston — at a time when the telecommunications industry was still regulated but starting to break up. After two years of working primarily on pricing for new services, she went to Columbia University for her MBA. During her first summer of graduate school, Booz Allen Hamilton hired McKinstry for an internship given her experience in telecommunications, an industry that was going through major changes at the time. After school, McKinstry continued working as a consultant in the media and telecommunications practices at Booz Allen Hamilton. After she had spent seven successful years there, CCH, then one of the largest U.S. legal and tax publishers, hired McKinstry to develop its digital publishing strategy. In 1996, Wolters Kluwer acquired CCH, and McKinstry’s professional experiences and acumen were deemed particularly valuable to the company’s growth strategy; she was repeatedly promoted until she left in 1999 to work as the CEO of SCP Communications, a medical information company. A year later, she returned to Wolters Kluwer to head its North American operations.
Along with her husband, McKinstry now lives in Amsterdam. Their two children, 25 and 20, after spending most of their childhood in the Netherlands, have returned to the United States for college and work. During a recent visit to New York, McKinstry talked with Strategy& about working abroad, life without a car, and what consulting taught her about running a company.
How has being based in the Netherlands for the past 12 years changed your perspective?
I’ve learned to be a better listener — different cultures each have their own nuances, and it’s important to understand what they are. I’ve also learned that there’s lots of different ways to solve problems. As long as you communicate where you want somebody to end up, there’s a lot of latitude for how they get there. .
I believe that all young people who have the ambition to ultimately run a global business should take an expat assignment because the learning is so significant. Until you live outside your home country, you don’t experience what it’s like to have to really adapt on the global stage.
What do you consider your greatest accomplishment?
Being the CEO of a growing, profitable business while having raised two children with my husband is something I certainly look back on with pride. My husband’s been extremely supportive, and I could not have had this level of success without him.
When I took over as CEO, the company, like most other media firms, was going through a difficult period. So we underwent a complete transformation that has touched almost every aspect of the company: the people, the capabilities, how we’re structured, how we resource things, how we work together. I think one of the most important decisions we made was to invest between 8 and 10 percent of our revenues back into new products and services. Since 2003, we’ve stuck to that commitment. Even at the height of the recession or the financial crisis, we cut costs in other areas, but we continued to invest. That was critical for the large innovative software solutions we’re building today. It takes a while [from] the time you think of a product to build it, to market it, and to get penetration in the market.
During a transformation like yours, what’s the leader’s role?
First, you have to be sure of your vision, commit to it, and have a team around you that also believes it and is executing against it. Second, you have to have the elevator pitch. You have to be able to succinctly say, here are the three priorities and why we’re doing this. Let’s go. It can’t be a complicated message. And finally, you have to be able to change and pivot when things aren’t going well. No plan is 100 percent executed the way you envision in the beginning .
What are some of your biggest challenges?
I think that for all CEOs in this day and age, economic volatility is a significant challenge, and it forces you to be nimble. Scenario planning has become an everyday discussion point for us, which wasn’t the case 15 years ago. And now we don’t do five-year plans. We do three-year plans, which we’re constantly updating because of how quickly things change.
More specifically to our business, one of the core challenges is how to best manage our legacy businesses while migrating into new technologies. Our customers use a broad range of solutions: They still use some print resources and digital information, but they also use newer workflow solutions. Our goal is to give them everything they need.
As you moved up in Wolters Kluwer, what stuck with you from your consulting days?
Consulting taught me three things that have proved absolutely invaluable in my career — problem solving, teamwork, and communication — all of which help you get to the most important goal: delivering results.
There was a real rigor at Booz Allen Hamilton around how do you work together to peel back a problem, dissect it to find the solution, and then clearly present it to the client. I still consider myself a strong speaker and writer today because of my training as a consultant. And I still remember something a partner said to me about communication skills: You’ll never get a second chance to make a first impression. At that time, a long-term consulting project was maybe 12 weeks, so you had a limited amount of time to make an impression on your team and the client. It had better be a good one.
What’s a typical day like for you now?
The majority of my job is decision making. At Wolters Kluwer, one of the things that we pride ourselves on is the fact that we make decisions relatively quickly based on facts.
I travel roughly 50 percent of the time, interacting with shareholders, employees, media, and customers. When I’m in the office, I focus on meetings with other colleagues to discuss what’s going on with various business initiatives that we have under way.
Can you share an example?
One of the things we’re excited about is the expansion of software solutions in our health division, like UpToDate, a product that physicians rely on for clinical decision support. It’s used in almost every patient encounter to figure out how to treat and diagnose a particular condition. Right now, we’re developing and launching a Chinese-language version of UpToDate. We’re taking what’s worked successfully in other places and adapting it for the Chinese market.
How would people closest to you describe you?
Smart, pragmatic, and humble. I hope they would also say I’m generous.
What do you consider your most marked characteristics?
I’m persistent and resilient.
Which talent would you most like to have?
The ability to speak foreign languages. Every Dutch person seems to speak at least three languages and I admire that.
What is your greatest extravagance and what is something you could live without?
I’m a big reader. In our fast-paced world, sitting down with a good book and reading just for pleasure is a definite extravagance for me. As far as something I could live without, I’d have to say my car. Now that our children are grown, my husband and I just moved from a suburb of the Hague into Amsterdam. We gave up our car and ride bikes instead.
Who or what do you most admire?
Individuals who have had major setbacks and come back from the experience stronger. In interviews, I often ask candidates to tell me about a setback they had, what they learned, and how they dealt with it. What I’m looking for is whether they can dust themselves off and get back at it. If they still have a positive attitude, and can still be productive, I admire that
What do you think is the most overrated virtue?
Patience. In this day and age where there’s so much change, whether it’s technological or global forces, a little impatience can be healthy.
What advice would you give to people starting out in business?
Above all else, deliver results. Know how to solve problems, build a team, and communicate well. But also be flexible and take risks, particularly ones that give you global exposure. When you listen to CEOs’ stories, you learn that few of them have taken a linear path. It’s almost always a little bit of a zigzag.

The first female—and first American—CEO of Wolters Kluwer in the Netherlands, McKinstry has led a digital transformation of the 175-year old Dutch publishing house. Wolters Kluwer’s stock price has doubled since she took charge a decade ago, and the firm has returned half of its cash to shareholders in 2015 in the form of dividends and share buybacks. McKinstry is the only CEO of a Dutch-listed company who has fulfilled the government’s target to have 30% women on company boards by 2016. And over half of the company’s 19,000 employees are women. —Rupali Arora

Nancy McKinstry



        Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_McKinstryUpdated: 2017-03-14T08:30Z
      
Nancy McKinstry.Nancy McKinstry (born 4 January 1959 in Connecticut, USA, now living in the Netherlands[1]) is CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board of Wolters Kluwer since September 1, 2003,[2] and Member of the Executive Board since June 1, 2001.Contents1 Education2 Early career3 Wolters Kluwer4 Boards and honors5 Personal life6 References7 See alsoEducationShe holds an MBA (Finance & Marketing) from Columbia Business School, a bachelor's degree in economics from University of Rhode Island (Phi Beta Kappa), and received a Doctor of Laws (honorary) from University of Rhode Island.[3]Early careerEarly in her career, McKinstry held management positions with Booz & Company (formerly Booz Allen Hamilton, currently known as Strategy&), an international management-consulting firm, where she focused on assignments in the media and technology industries. In 1999, McKinstry worked as CEO of SCP Communications, a medical information company, before rejoining Wolters Kluwer to head its North American operations.Wolters KluwerBefore becoming a CEO of Wolters Kluwer in 2003, McKinstry was chief executive of the company’s North American operations and had held a range of senior positions at subsidiaries, including chief executive of CCH Legal Information Services, now a part of Wolters Kluwer’s Legal & Regulatory division.[4] Earlier, McKinstry held product management positions with CCH INCORPORATED, now part of Wolters Kluwer’sTax & Accounting division.[5] She is both the Dutch company’s first American and first female chief executive. She has praised her board’s “courage” in making the appointment and credits her deep group experience in helping with “the transformation from print to digital … as quickly as possible”.[6] Today three-quarters of Wolters Kluwer's revenue comes from online or electronic products, up from 71 percent in 2011, and 49 percent when the transition from print was launched at the end of 2008.[7]McKinstry is not a fan of quotas,[8] but considers diversity a priority for the company. Currently Wolters Kluwer has 28% female executives (in 2003, only 20% had top leadership posts), 43% female managers, and 54% female employees.[9] "In my experience it's key to have strong diversity at the middle management level because that is really what you draw on as you look to fill executive positions. If you don't have enough diversity at that level it's very difficult to be able to really get diversity at the most senior levels."[10] She takes a hands on approach to making sure women are rising to the top, “We’ve been able to attract female talent because they see women leading different parts of the company. Diversity helps, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.”[11]Wolters Kluwer has a talent management program which identifies high potential executives, "We specifically work on programs to provide them with the right experience to ensure they're developing the kind of leadership skills that they would need to get to the top of the organization."[12] Today many of the company's key businesses are run by women. Two of the largest divisions have female CEO's - Karen Abramson, CEO for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting[13] and Stacey Caywood, CEO of Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory[14] Shasha Chang is the Chief Executive Officer of Wolters Kluwer China since June 2009,[15] overseeing all Wolters Kluwer activities in greater China, one of the key growth markets for the company. "In some companies, women tend to take on functional roles but at Wolters Kluwer, women have responsibility for a P&L. You have to have that kind of experience and track record if you eventually want to aspire to be a CEO of a company or to sit as a non-executive director of a multi-national," McKinstry says.[16]Innovation is the key to Wolters Kluwer's success. That’s why the company invests 8-10% of its annual revenues in new product developments and encourages employees to bring forward innovative ideas.[17] In 2012 McKinstry instituted a company-wide innovation contest to spur thought leadership, which also allows her to review the pool of talent, including women.[18]Boards and honorsNancy McKinstry is a member of the Boards of Directors of Sanoma Oyj and Abbott. She is also a member of the Advisory Council of the Amsterdam Institute of Finance, the Advisory Board for the University of Rhode Island, the Advisory Board of the Harrington School of Communication and Media, and the Board of Overseers of Columbia Business School. In August 2011, she was appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee, given her astute business leadership and long-standing expertise in the information and publishing industry.[19]In 2012 McKinstry was ranked number 15 on Fortune’s Global 50 Most Powerful Women in Business(and 13 in 2011.)[20] She has been in the top 10 on this list in 2004, 2005, and 2006.[21] She has been among the Financial Times’ Top 50 Women in World Business for several consecutive years, being listed at number 17 most recently in 2011.[22] In 2009 McKinstry was ranked number 43 on the Forbes list of 100 Most Powerful Women, on which she represented one of the two women from the Netherlands (the other being Neelie Kroes).[23] In August 2011, she has been appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee.[24]Personal lifeNancy McKinstry is married and has two children, a son and a daughter. Her husband, an anesthesiologist, now splits his time between his job in New York and staying home with their children in the Netherlands.[25]References^ Fembusiness.nl^ "Nancy McKinstry Profile".

  (CNN) -- As CEO and Chairman of Wolters Kluwer, Nancy McKinstry spearheaded the successful transformation of the company into a forward-looking, customer-focused global information services provider for professionals worldwide. 

 Since being named head of the company in 2003, McKinstry has focused on creating an organization that delivers superior value to customers and shareholders and is leading the organization as it carries out a strategy to accelerate profitable growth. Before assuming her present position, Ms. McKinstry gained more than a decade of experience at Wolters Kluwer and its operating companies in North America. Most recently she was an Executive Board Member of the company and previously served as CEO of Wolters Kluwer's operations in North America. She also was President and CEO of CCH Legal Information Services, now a part of Wolters Kluwer's Corporate & Financial Services division. Earlier, McKinstry held product management positions with CCH INCORPORATED, now part of Wolters Kluwer's Tax, Accounting & Legal division.

In a year where half of the companies on our list have lost market value, the 175-year-old Dutch publishing house headed by McKinstry has a better story to tell; market cap at the company is up 30%, to $13 billion dollars. In her 13-year tenure, McKinstry, the longest-serving CEO in the Netherlands, has transformed the group from a prosaic operation to a digital powerhouse, divesting non-core assets and investing nearly $1 billion in digital and software acquisitions over the past decade. She has also rolled out smart new products like Cheetah, an online tool for legal professionals. In the first half of 2016, 86% of the group’s revenue came from digital services and solutions.

Nancy McKinstry.


Nancy McKinstry (born 4 January 1959 in Connecticut, USA, now living in the Netherlands[1]) is CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board of Wolters Kluwer since September 1, 2003,[2] and Member of the Executive Board since June 1, 2001.

Education[edit]
She holds an MBA (Finance & Marketing) from Columbia Business School, a bachelor's degree in economics from University of Rhode Island (Phi Beta Kappa), and received a Doctor of Laws (honorary) from University of Rhode Island.[3]
Early career[edit]
Early in her career, McKinstry held management positions with Booz & Company (formerly Booz Allen Hamilton, currently known as Strategy&), an international management-consulting firm, where she focused on assignments in the media and technology industries. In 1999, McKinstry worked as CEO of SCP Communications, a medical information company, before rejoining Wolters Kluwer to head its North American operations.
Wolters Kluwer[edit]
Before becoming a CEO of Wolters Kluwer in 2003, McKinstry was chief executive of the company’s North American operations and had held a range of senior positions at subsidiaries, including chief executive of CCH Legal Information Services, now a part of Wolters Kluwer’s Legal & Regulatory division.[4] Earlier, McKinstry held product management positions with CCH INCORPORATED, now part of Wolters Kluwer’sTax & Accounting division.[5] She is both the Dutch company’s first American and first female chief executive. She has praised her board’s “courage” in making the appointment and credits her deep group experience in helping with “the transformation from print to digital … as quickly as possible”.[6] Today three-quarters of Wolters Kluwer's revenue comes from online or electronic products, up from 71 percent in 2011, and 49 percent when the transition from print was launched at the end of 2008.[7]
McKinstry is not a fan of quotas,[8] but considers diversity a priority for the company. Currently Wolters Kluwer has 28% female executives (in 2003, only 20% had top leadership posts), 43% female managers, and 54% female employees.[9] "In my experience it's key to have strong diversity at the middle management level because that is really what you draw on as you look to fill executive positions. If you don't have enough diversity at that level it's very difficult to be able to really get diversity at the most senior levels."[10] She takes a hands on approach to making sure women are rising to the top, “We’ve been able to attract female talent because they see women leading different parts of the company. Diversity helps, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.”[11]
Wolters Kluwer has a talent management program which identifies high potential executives, "We specifically work on programs to provide them with the right experience to ensure they're developing the kind of leadership skills that they would need to get to the top of the organization."[12] Today many of the company's key businesses are run by women. Two of the largest divisions have female CEO's - Karen Abramson, CEO for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting[13] and Stacey Caywood, CEO of Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory[14] Shasha Chang is the Chief Executive Officer of Wolters Kluwer China since June 2009,[15] overseeing all Wolters Kluwer activities in greater China, one of the key growth markets for the company. "In some companies, women tend to take on functional roles but at Wolters Kluwer, women have responsibility for a P&L. You have to have that kind of experience and track record if you eventually want to aspire to be a CEO of a company or to sit as a non-executive director of a multi-national," McKinstry says.[16]
Innovation is the key to Wolters Kluwer's success. That’s why the company invests 8-10% of its annual revenues in new product developments and encourages employees to bring forward innovative ideas.[17] In 2012 McKinstry instituted a company-wide innovation contest to spur thought leadership, which also allows her to review the pool of talent, including women.[18]
Boards and honors[edit]
Nancy McKinstry is a member of the Boards of Directors of Sanoma Oyj and Abbott. She is also a member of the Advisory Council of the Amsterdam Institute of Finance, the Advisory Board for the University of Rhode Island, the Advisory Board of the Harrington School of Communication and Media, and the Board of Overseers of Columbia Business School. In August 2011, she was appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee, given her astute business leadership and long-standing expertise in the information and publishing industry.[19]
In 2012 McKinstry was ranked number 15 on Fortune’s Global 50 Most Powerful Women in Business(and 13 in 2011.)[20] She has been in the top 10 on this list in 2004, 2005, and 2006.[21] She has been among the Financial Times’ Top 50 Women in World Business for several consecutive years, being listed at number 17 most recently in 2011.[22] In 2009 McKinstry was ranked number 43 on the Forbes list of 100 Most Powerful Women, on which she represented one of the two women from the Netherlands (the other being Neelie Kroes).[23] In August 2011, she has been appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Nancy McKinstry is married and has two children, a son and a daughter. Her husband, an anesthesiologist, now splits his time between his job in New York and staying home with their children in the Netherlands.[25]

Education[edit]
She holds an MBA (Finance & Marketing) from Columbia Business School, a bachelor's degree in economics from University of Rhode Island (Phi Beta Kappa), and received a Doctor of Laws (honorary) from University of Rhode Island.[3]
Early career[edit]
Early in her career, McKinstry held management positions with Booz & Company (formerly Booz Allen Hamilton, currently known as Strategy&), an international management-consulting firm, where she focused on assignments in the media and technology industries. In 1999, McKinstry worked as CEO of SCP Communications, a medical information company, before rejoining Wolters Kluwer to head its North American operations.
Wolters Kluwer[edit]
Before becoming a CEO of Wolters Kluwer in 2003, McKinstry was chief executive of the company’s North American operations and had held a range of senior positions at subsidiaries, including chief executive of CCH Legal Information Services, now a part of Wolters Kluwer’s Legal & Regulatory division.[4] Earlier, McKinstry held product management positions with CCH INCORPORATED, now part of Wolters Kluwer’sTax & Accounting division.[5] She is both the Dutch company’s first American and first female chief executive. She has praised her board’s “courage” in making the appointment and credits her deep group experience in helping with “the transformation from print to digital … as quickly as possible”.[6] Today three-quarters of Wolters Kluwer's revenue comes from online or electronic products, up from 71 percent in 2011, and 49 percent when the transition from print was launched at the end of 2008.[7]
McKinstry is not a fan of quotas,[8] but considers diversity a priority for the company. Currently Wolters Kluwer has 28% female executives (in 2003, only 20% had top leadership posts), 43% female managers, and 54% female employees.[9] "In my experience it's key to have strong diversity at the middle management level because that is really what you draw on as you look to fill executive positions. If you don't have enough diversity at that level it's very difficult to be able to really get diversity at the most senior levels."[10] She takes a hands on approach to making sure women are rising to the top, “We’ve been able to attract female talent because they see women leading different parts of the company. Diversity helps, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.”[11]
Wolters Kluwer has a talent management program which identifies high potential executives, "We specifically work on programs to provide them with the right experience to ensure they're developing the kind of leadership skills that they would need to get to the top of the organization."[12] Today many of the company's key businesses are run by women. Two of the largest divisions have female CEO's - Karen Abramson, CEO for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting[13] and Stacey Caywood, CEO of Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory[14] Shasha Chang is the Chief Executive Officer of Wolters Kluwer China since June 2009,[15] overseeing all Wolters Kluwer activities in greater China, one of the key growth markets for the company. "In some companies, women tend to take on functional roles but at Wolters Kluwer, women have responsibility for a P&L. You have to have that kind of experience and track record if you eventually want to aspire to be a CEO of a company or to sit as a non-executive director of a multi-national," McKinstry says.[16]
Innovation is the key to Wolters Kluwer's success. That’s why the company invests 8-10% of its annual revenues in new product developments and encourages employees to bring forward innovative ideas.[17] In 2012 McKinstry instituted a company-wide innovation contest to spur thought leadership, which also allows her to review the pool of talent, including women.[18]
Boards and honors[edit]
Nancy McKinstry is a member of the Boards of Directors of Sanoma Oyj and Abbott. She is also a member of the Advisory Council of the Amsterdam Institute of Finance, the Advisory Board for the University of Rhode Island, the Advisory Board of the Harrington School of Communication and Media, and the Board of Overseers of Columbia Business School. In August 2011, she was appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee, given her astute business leadership and long-standing expertise in the information and publishing industry.[19]
In 2012 McKinstry was ranked number 15 on Fortune’s Global 50 Most Powerful Women in Business(and 13 in 2011.)[20] She has been in the top 10 on this list in 2004, 2005, and 2006.[21] She has been among the Financial Times’ Top 50 Women in World Business for several consecutive years, being listed at number 17 most recently in 2011.[22] In 2009 McKinstry was ranked number 43 on the Forbes list of 100 Most Powerful Women, on which she represented one of the two women from the Netherlands (the other being Neelie Kroes).[23] In August 2011, she has been appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Nancy McKinstry is married and has two children, a son and a daughter. Her husband, an anesthesiologist, now splits his time between his job in New York and staying home with their children in the Netherlands.[25]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
