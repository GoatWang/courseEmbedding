BUSINESS

Former Skype CEO Josh Silverman returns to Greylock Partners as executive in residence

Former Skype chief executive Josh Silverman will be joining venture firm Greylock Partners as an executive in residence next year. A LinkedIn post by Reid Hoffman, an investing partner with the firm, reveals Silverman will be tasked with helping Greylock’s portfolio companies scale their businesses, think globally, and establish strong leadership and team culture.
Currently, Silverman serves as the president of consumer products and services at American Express. Prior to that he’s had a few other stints in the upper echelons of leadership with different firms, including most notably Skype (before the Microsoft acquisition), Shopping.com (an eBay company), and Evite.
This isn’t his first time at Greylock Partners, as he served in the exact same role in 2010 for about nine months. During that time, he consulted on business strategy and growth.
Previous executives in residences at Greylock have included Mozilla’s CEO Chris Beard, Pandora’s chief strategy officer Sara Clemens, and Wealthfront’s CEO Adam Nash and vice president of strategic partnerships Alison Rosenthal. Silverman will be joining current EIR and Cisco veteran Howie Xu.

Product Liability 


Description
Joshua Silverman is a product liability lawyer who fights to obtain compensation for his clients after personal injuries from a defective product. It is important in a product liability case that the faulty product, equipment, or machinery is preserved, as it critical to proving the liability of the manufacturer or seller of the defective product. Product liability actions include defective automobiles, workplace machinery, household products, and consumer goods.



View transcript


A products liability case is a case involving somebody who was injured
because of a product that they have either purchased or, somebody else was
using that caused them to sustain a very serious injury and that includes a
defective automobile, where, for example, the seat belts or the airbags
don't work properly. A medical device, if you go into surgery and the
medical device doesn't work properly, or even thinking about cribs and toys
and things that we presume are going to be safe for our children.

In a products liability case, one of the most important things is that
we've got to preserve the evidence from the beginning and that's why, I
always encourage people, if they think they've been injured by a defective
product, to call me promptly because if we don't have whatever it is that
caused the injury, we're probably not going to be able to make a case.
We've got to prove that it was defective. So, I encourage people to bring
them in to me or, I'll go out to them to secure the evidence and in many
cases, we'll rent a storage unit to secure it.

When you're selecting a products liability lawyer, the critical question
is, how long have you been handling products liability? Have you handled
cases similar to mine? In my practice, I've been dealing with products
liability cases since day one and we've handled cases involving defective
automobiles, defective baby products, defective medical devices, but we've
run the gamut on the types of products that have caused very serious
injuries to our client.

If you would like more information, what I would encourage you to do is to
give me a call and I'll be happy to discuss with you your situation at no
fee. Or from the website, you can click your questions to me and I'll get
back in touch with you promptly.
