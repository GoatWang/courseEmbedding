The Worst and Most Unethical Bank Ever!
I have dealt with bank's for more that 30 years and this bank, and the bank it acquired (Integrity Bank), are certainly the most unethical banks I have ever dealt with!  We entered into a new construction loan with the former Integrity Bank and the bank paid our contractor (Fink Construction) without our authorization or knowledge and the contractor lef the job site before the home was completed.  We have spent several years trying to get our money bank and have incurred huge legal costs due to Integrity Bank and now S & T Bank.  I spend the rest of my life warning people and the regulatory agencies against this bank as well as the contractor.  This has been a terrible experience yet if I can help just one person by wearing them against S & T Bank and Fink Construction then  just maybe I will feel it was worth the experience!

Best Banking Experience
I have dealt with several banks over the years and S&T Penn Hills has far exceeded any experience I have had previously.  The individual person is valued, not just businesses.  All the people are very friendly and helpful.  I recommend S&T to everyone looking for a bank.

Conventional loans
We offer conventional financing with competitive fixed rates for the purchase of your new home or refinance of your existing home.







Portfolio loans
We provides financing opportunities for unique properties and borrowers that are generally not accepted in the secondary market.







Construction loans
Our construction loans feature one convenient closing that allows customers to convert their construction loan to a permanent mortgage at the end of the construction period.  There are also options to begin new construction while still living in your current home.







Pre-approvals
With a pre-approval you will know exactly what you can afford giving you the confidence you need in your home search.  Sellers will consider your offer more seriously knowing that you've been pre-approved for financing.







Bridge loans
Bridge loans enable customers to use the equity in their present home toward financing a new home. It's a powerful tool that buyers can leverage to get a deal moving.







First-time homebuyers
We have great options for first-time homebuyers. Products such as PHFA's HFA* program and VA loans offer low down payments, competitive rates, and conservative monthly payments.  The dream of home ownership is within reach!







PHFA (Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency) HFA* loans
Together with the PHFA, we are able to offer competitive rate mortgage loans with low down payment options and no private mortgage insurance requirement. Minimum borrower contributions could be as low as $1,000, and no requirement for monthly mortgage insurance payments creates a lower overall monthly payment.







VA loans
Veterans, service members, and eligible surviving spouses may be eligible for loans that are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. VA loans feature competitive rates, low or no down payment, and no private mortgage insurance requirement.







FHA
We're an approved lender to offer loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration. FHA loans offer borrowers with less than perfect credit competitive interest rates and low down payment options.

Mr. Donnelly has spent over 27 years working with the Indiana County Chamber of Commerce and the Indiana County Development Corporation in retaining and attracting many businesses in the Indiana, PA area.

Mr. Jones assisted the S&T Board with integration and strategic issues following the acquisition. Mr. Jones’ legal practice, which focuses on estate administration and estate litigation, allows him to provide valuable insight to the S&T Board specifically with respect to our Wealth Management division, including on such issues as customer acquisition, marketing, strategic considerations, compliance and legal risk. We believe that Mr. Jones’ experience as a director of a similar bank to S&T Bank, together with his legal experience as it relates to one of our core businesses and his years of experience on the S&T Board, qualifies him to serve as a director and serve on our Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

We believe that Mr. Krieger’s 24 years of experience at S&T, including leading our commercial lending group, adds valuable experience to the S&T Board. Mr. Krieger has deep knowledge of our lending practices and our customer base, and his commercial lending experience, both at S&T and at his prior employer, provides the S&T Board with significant operational insights regarding credit risk.

Mr. Miller is retired but was formerly Chief Executive Officer of S&T and S&T Bank from 1998 until 2008 and President of S&T and S&T Bank from 1993 until 2005. We believe that Mr. Miller’s banking experience, including 37 years with S&T or a bank acquired by S&T and his service as our former chief executive officer, provides him with a unique perspective of our business, including our markets, customer base, senior management, key employees, potential customers, and operations and finances, and qualifies him to serve on the S&T Board.

Mr. Palermo’s career also includes 38 years in public accounting and four years as a vice president and controller at a community bank. We believe that Mr. Palermo’s background in accounting and finance, as well as his prior bank audit committee experience, bring a valuable perspective to the S&T Board both with respect to accounting, financial and strategic aspects of S&T’s business and to the Audit Committee on which he serves as “audit committee financial expert.” We further believe that Mr. Palermo’s extensive board experience qualifies him to be a member of the S&T Board and to serve on the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
