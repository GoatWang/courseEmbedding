BALTIMORE, Jan. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE:    LM) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to combine Permal, Legg Mason's existing hedge fund platform, with EnTrust Capital. EnTrust is a leading independent hedge fund investor and alternative asset manager headquartered in New York with approximately $12 billion in total assets and complementary investment strategies, investor base and business mix to Permal.  The business combination will create a new global alternatives firm with over $26 billion in pro-forma AUM1 and total assets of $29 billion2.  The firm will have a diverse offering of proprietary investment products with a significant number of institutional and high net worth investors. As a result of the combination, Legg Mason will own 65% of the new entity, branded EnTrustPermal, with 35% being owned by Gregg S. Hymowitz, EnTrust's Co-founder and Managing Partner.


EnTrustPermal will be led by Mr. Hymowitz, who will become the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EnTrustPermal.  Key investment and business professionals from both firms will continue to serve the investors of the new organization.  EnTrustPermal will have the global infrastructure, resources, investment professionals and underlying investment managers to source, research and structure investment opportunities worldwide on behalf of its international client base.
The combination creates a platform with the necessary scale and leadership team to significantly expand and evolve its multi-alternative capabilities and offerings.  The expanded investment capabilities include:

A combined team of over 55 investment professionals, with key leaders from both firms signing contracts 
Over 150 unique investment offerings across 18 different investment-strategies 
A materially larger investment platform, ranging from opportunistic co-investments with longer duration locked-up capital, tail-risk hedging strategies and bespoked customized investment solutions 
A more rapid evolution of innovative, alternative products and lines of business, including direct hedge funds and private debt offerings 
Increased sources of proprietary investment opportunities 
Ability to broaden the organization's innovative existing Managed Account Platform 
Joseph A. Sullivan, Chairman and CEO of Legg Mason, said, "The combined EnTrustPermal brings together two leading names in the alternative space, creating a significant potential growth engine for Legg Mason.  The team at EnTrust has a proven track record for driving significant organic growth through product innovation, with over 20% growth annually since the financial crisis.  We see meaningful opportunities to combine this innovation with Permal's blue chip client base, product offering and global footprint."
Gregg S. Hymowitz, Managing Partner of EnTrust, said, "The combination of EnTrust and Permal creates a powerful organization in the hedge fund universe.  EnTrustPermal's scale, resources and global investment talent will be able to deliver market differentiated proprietary investments to our over 700 combined institutional accounts and significant number of high-net worth investors.  The complementary nature of our investment strategies, geographies and global investor/partner base dramatically springboards us over our competition.   The EnTrust and Permal teams are eager to start delivering for our loyal investor base."
Omar Kodmani, Permal Group Chief Executive Officer, said, "The future of our industry is about offering alternative investment solutions on multiple fronts.  To achieve this, you need scale and talent and EnTrustPermal combines both.  We currently have one of the best resourced investment teams in the industry and which, when paired with EnTrust offers more to our clients and strengthens our business."
The combination is expected to close in mid-2016.  The transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to Legg Mason's earnings in the first year, after giving effect to estimated cost savings achieved that year and excluding restructuring and transition charges.   Legg Mason expects EnTrustPermal to achieve cost savings of approximately $35-$40 million per year.  In connection with the combination of the businesses, Legg Mason expects to incur restructuring and transition costs of approximately $100 million, beginning in the Company's 4th Fiscal Quarter of 2016 and continuing throughout Fiscal Year 2017.

For Non-U.S. Persons and Their Advisors: 
            The information contained in this part of the Website is directed solely to Non-U.S. persons and their advisers. By entering this Website you are
            certifying that you are not a U.S. person (including a resident of the United States, a corporation, partnership or other entity organized under U.S. laws,
            any estate of which any executor or administrator is a U.S. person or any trust of which any trustee is a U.S. person), or acting on behalf of a U.S.
            person. If you are not sure whether you are considered a U.S. person, please consult your legal adviser.
        

            The information provided on the Website is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction where such distribution or
            use is prohibited, or that would subject EnTrustPermal to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction. In particular, this expanded part of the
            Website for non-U.S. qualifying investors is directed solely to non-U.S. persons and their advisors who are outside the U.S. and must not be acted upon by
            persons in the U.S.
        

For U.K. Investors: 
            To the extent that material on the Website is issued in the UK, it is approved for the purposes of S.21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 by
            EnTrustPermal Ltd. an entity which is authorized and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), save where a particular part of the Website
            is directed at exempt recipients only.
        

            EnTrustPermal Ltd. does not exclude or restrict any duty or liability it may have in respect of the Website to its customers under the UK Financial
            Services and Markets Act 2000 or the regulatory system.
        

            EnTrustPermal Ltd. has approved the material in the Distributor Information only to the extent it is accessible in the U.K. by persons to whom
            EnTrustPermal Ltd. could itself have communicated such material.
        

            EnTrustPermal funds are unregulated collective investment schemes for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the U.K.
        

            Persons dealing with agents of the EnTrustPermal funds outside the U.K. or investing in the EnTrustPermal funds may not be covered by the rules and
            regulations made for the protection of investors in the U.K. This means that they will not have the benefit of rights designed to protect investors under
            the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and under the rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. In particular they may not benefit from the right to
            claim through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme for losses resulting from a default of obligations owed under relevant regulations.
        

UK Stewardship Code: 
            FCA Conduct of Business Rule 2.2.3R, requires the investment firms which it covers to disclose the nature of their commitment to the UK Financial Reporting
            Council's Stewardship Code (the "Code") or, where they do not comply with the Code, the reasons for not doing so. The Code is voluntary and sets out a
            number of principles relating to engagement by investors with U.K. equity issuers.
        

            EnTrustPermal Ltd. predominantly manages funds of hedge funds, and does not generally invest directly with U.K. companies. As such, the Code is not
            generally applicable to EnTrustPermal Ltd.’s investment management business. However, EnTrustPermal does support the broad aims and objectives of the Code.
            We continue to maintain policies and procedures designed to identify and manage conflicts of interest as they arise, as well as a code of ethics policy to
            which all employees are bound. Proxy voting in respect of the underlying hedge funds in which EnTrustPermal invests is conducted in accordance with our
            proxy voting policy, which is reviewed on an annual basis and updated as necessary.
        

For U.S. and Canadian Institutional Investors and Distributors to U.S. Institutions: 
            The information contained in this part of the Website is directed solely to qualified U.S. and Canadian institutions and distributors to qualified U.S.
            institutions.
        

            Although certain EnTrustPermal entities are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as investment advisers under the U.S. Investment
            Advisers Act of 1940, securities issued by certain of the EnTrustPermal Funds have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and have not
            been registered with, or approved by, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities administrator or any other regulatory authority.
            The securities issued by such EnTrustPermal Funds therefore cannot be sold, transferred or pledged (although they may be redeemed as described in each
            fund's offering documents) in the absence of such registration or the availability of an exemption therefrom. There is no public or other market for these
            securities, and no such market is expected to develop. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor the securities regulatory authority or
            commission of any state of the United States has passed upon the value of the securities of the EnTrustPermal Funds, made any recommendations as to their
            purchase, approved or disapproved any offering made by EnTrustPermal Funds or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of any information contained on the
            Website or in the offering materials for the EnTrustPermal Funds. Any contrary representation is a criminal offense.
        

            Unless otherwise noted, EnTrustPermal Funds have not been and will not be registered as investment companies under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940.
        

            U.S. institutions entering this area of the Website will be required to represent to EnTrustPermal that they are "accredited investors" as such term is
            defined under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and "qualified purchasers" as such term is defined under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940.
        

            Canadian institutions entering this area of the Website will be required to represent to EnTrustPermal that they are "accredited investors" as such term is
            defined under the Canadian National Instrument 45-106 – Prospectus and Registration Exemptions.
        

French investors: 
            To the extent that material on the Website is issued in France, such issuance is by EnTrustPermal SAS or EnTrustPermal Ltd. EnTrustPermal SAS is a French
            simplified joint-stock company, governed by French law, registered with the Paris Registry of Commerce and Companies, SIRET 532 384 195 00022.

            GP-11000023.
        

            EnTrustPermal funds have not been submitted to, and have not been approved by, the AMF or any other regulatory authority in France. The information
            provided is not for general distribution in France. Any person who accesses this Website is hereby notified that no action has or will be taken that allows
            the offer and marketing of the Shares in France. Accordingly, the Shares of the EnTrustPermal funds are not being marketed, offered, sold or delivered in
            France and neither this information nor any offering material relating to the Shares may be distributed or made available in France. Persons who are
            resident in France and who purchase/subscribe to Shares of the EnTrustPermal funds will not have the benefit of any protection from the French regulators
            or regulations.
        

Singapore investors: 
            EnTrustPermal Singapore is a division of Legg Mason Asset Management Singapore Pte. Limited (Registration Number (UEN): 200007942R). The offer or
            invitation of Shares, does not relate to a collective investment scheme which are authorized under Section 286 of the Securities and Futures Act, Chapter
            289 of Singapore (the "SFA") or recognized under Section 287 of the SFA. The EnTrustPermal funds are not authorized or recognized by the Monetary Authority
            of Singapore (the "MAS") and the Shares are not allowed to be offered to the retail public. Any information contained on the website is only directed at
            (i) an institutional investor under Section 304 of the SFA, (ii) to a relevant person pursuant to Section 305(1), or any person pursuant to Section 305(2),
            and in accordance with the conditions specified in Section 305, of the SFA, or (iii) otherwise pursuant to, and in accordance with the conditions of, any
            other applicable provision of the SFA.
        

Hong Kong investors: 
            Permal (Hong Kong) Limited is licensed by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) for dealing in, and advising on, securities. Any
            information contained on this Website has not been approved by the SFC. Material on this Website is directed at professional investors only.

Australian investors: 
            EnTrustPermal Ltd. has been granted an exemption from the requirement to hold an Australian Financial Services License under the Australian Corporations
            Act 2001 in respect of the financial services provided to wholesale clients in Australia ("Exemption"). The Exemption was granted on condition that we
            alert you to this and to the fact that EnTrustPermal Ltd. is regulated by the FCA under applicable English laws which differ from Australian Laws and that
            any information contained on this Website in the course of providing financial services will be prepared in accordance with English regulatory requirements
            (and not Australian laws).
        

            Nothing on this Website constitutes an offer of Shares or financial product advice to a 'retail client' (as defined in section 761G of the Corporations Act
            and applicable regulations).
