Marie & family,  Not aware of Bobbie's illness was deeply saddened by reading his OB in the Mercury on my computer. Knowing Bob since he was part of my championship ball team playing for Brownbacks church league some 60 years ago he was always great to be around & easy to coach. Living a life of many interest he will be missed by many.  My condolence to you & all his family     Dick Trythall--formally of Bucktown, Pa.     Murrells Int.SC

Background



Early Career I did not wake up suddenly at the age of 55, decide to become an artist, move
to Blue Mountain and begin to paint.
My desire to draw was evident from my earliest years, but the route I
took to Blue Mountain as a self-employed artist was certainly not a direct one
and involved a period of development and determination which is necessary in
every artistic career. My mother likes to
remind me that I showed some inclination to draw at the age of three,
but my career as an artist began, in my memory, at the age of seven when I fell under the
spell of Walt Disney cartoons and began to
copy the simple line structures while entertaining dreams of joining
Disney Studios in California when I grew up. By 1937, when I was nine, another art
form, the comic strip, was sweeping the
country and comic books were available in all the stores. This became my obsession for the next five years,
and I remember that I spent hours absorbing inspiration from Alex Raymond's
"Flash Gordon," Milton Caniffs "Terry and the Pirates" and
Harold Foster's "Prince Valiant." Working in the
simple black and white, pen and ink medium was to serve me well as I
learned, during this period, to draw competently without the aid of colour. At 13 I had
the privilege of meeting the creator of Superman,
Joe Schuster, but by 14, when I did my last comic strip, I had realized
that the world of the professional comic strip artist was one of demanding deadlines, and my own work habits seemed
more geared to a loose structure, so I drifted at 15 into a field closer
to magazine illustration. The war seemed to
intervene at this point, and I interrupted a four year art course at
Northern Vocational & Technical Institute in Toronto for the more
academic environment of St. Andrew's College in Aurora when my family moved to
Midland to be with my father, who was doing war work
there. I remember that the text books I used during this period which weren't illustrated, had
their margins filled with pencil sketches. I never lost the desire to be an
artist in this two year period, went to art
shows in Toronto at every opportunity, and in 1946, when the family
returned to Toronto, I resumed the art course at Northern Vocational. In the summer of
1947 I enrolled in the Banff School of Fine Arts with the intention of
learning how to do landscapes as a complement to the figure
illustrations I was doing at the time. For some reason I couldn't find the right
teacher to suit my temperament and I drifted off by myself to try to evolve a style of my
own. In the last week of the course I discovered the work of Walter J.
Phillips, who was having a show of watercolours there, and that exposure
provided me with the necessary enthusiasm and motivation to tackle this
exciting medium. As I look back on the art course at
Northern Vocational, I realize that it gave
me a good foundation in the basics of design, lettering, life and still
life, illustration, modeling and art history. My student friends and I dreamed of exciting careers as professional
artists, but the message which came
through our curriculum was that it would be more realistic for us to enter the commercial art world just to be
able to eat regularly. John Bennett, who wrote the introduction for this book,
was one of my teachers during that period, and I remember that he
encouraged us, in spite of the bitter
realities of the Canadian art market, to work outdoors by taking our class to neighbouring parks in order
to free us and our spirits from the comforts, and possibly the
constrictions, of a studio atmosphere. Work World  Following
graduation I spent two months preparing my portfolio for the many studios I
would visit before being employed by Taber, Dulmage and Feheley, where I served
my apprenticeship while I studied art by correspondence through the Famous
Artists Course in Westport, Connecticut I
remember that Norman Rockwell received my first piece of work and took me to task for lack of
preparation. This hand slapping was
the kind of constructive criticism that led me in future years to make a
concentrated effort to spend many hours of preliminary preparation for my work. During the summer of 1950 I became
acquainted with the work of the American artists, Adolph Triedler and Winslow
Homer. Their tropical watercolours, coupled
with my own attraction to Hawaii and the tropical environment, led me to the first
of three visits to Hawaii. Other tropical painting sessions included
Antigua and Bermuda. Hawaii was my real
passion as there I could surf, become proficient on the ukulele and
generally absorb the freedom of the place. During my first two month stay I
produced a large illustrated 82 page book on my visit, and letters I
wrote, while under the influence of the tropics, were always covered with free, loose
watercolour studies of the water, the shoreline and the tropical atmosphere. I remember that my friends started to marry during this time, and I would respond by giving them a landscape painting as a
wedding gift. Painting on location in Ontario took place around
Lake Simcoe where my parents went for summer
holidays in those early years. The south shore provided marvelous
material, and I began to work freely in tempera, which I always carried around in jars. Someone who had acquired two of
these early paintings in 1953 brought them back at my request recently so that I could photograph them. Seeing
them again was for me like having a family reunion after long years of
separation. By 1954 I was working on point of sale pieces for a
display company and creating ideas
rather than executing someone else's concepts. A natural
progression seemed to follow when I became art director with Hayhurst
Advertising in Toronto. Here I did photography, layout, assembly and learned
how to use lettering as an effective communication device. This period also gave me confidence to sell a product, which I drew
upon when I took the step to become a self employed artist in 1961.Self EmploymentIn 1958 I built my
original chalet at Blue Mountain and began to enjoy the outdoor life and especially
the skiing that the area offered. While on a
ski trip in New Hampshire I met a local artist, David C. Baker, who had established a roadside art gallery which
allowed him to function without big
city representation. The concept appealed to me and the more I thought about it, the more desirable it became.
To test the waters, so to speak, I
spent a month doing a set of nine temperas, working from my winter chalet in Craigleith. The whole
experience was so mentally and artistically rewarding that it left no
doubt that this was meant to be my ultimate
vocation. Three months after having grafted a studio to my chalet, I
moved to Blue Mountain and began my career as a full time professional artist. In 1966 I married Barbara Flexman of Ottawa. Our
son, Christopher, was born in 1967 and Gordon in 1970. Now life repeats
itself: Christopher attends St. Andrews and
Gordon shows promise as an artist. All
of us share in the process of being self-employed by opening our home to
visitors to the Gallery and making them feel welcome. That move in 1961
gave me an opportunity to enjoy life fully and to produce a wealth of original
work through which I can share the joy I feel.
