I'm here to help
When it comes to Medicare, one size definitely does not fit all. What works well for your neighbor may not be the right plan for you. Some people may be looking for a stand-alone prescription drug plan to supplement their Original Medicare plan. Others may choose a Medicare Advantage plan that combines doctor appointments, hospital visits and prescription drug coverage into one simple plan. These plans also often include other features, like vision and dental, that could help you save even more money. I'm happy to help you find a plan that meets your needs.


Call me directly to set up a time for an in-person session.

                    Frequently Asked Questions
                

Q: Why should I choose UnitedHealthcare?

                        A: At UnitedHealthcare we listen to your needs and offer you many different plans to choose from. Because feeling good about your health starts with feeling good about your health care coverage.
                    
Q: Can I bring a friend, neighbor or relative to a neighborhood meeting?

                        A: Yes. You are encouraged to bring a friend, neighbor or relative to neighborhood meetings. If you are bringing additional guests, please RSVP as space is limited.
                    
Q: How long does a neighborhood meeting last?

                        A: The duration of a neighborhood meeting can vary by location, attendance and time of year. A typical neighborhood meeting may include a 45-minute presentation completed by a licensed sales agent and a 15-minute question-and- answer session.
                    
Q: Will food be served at neighborhood meetings?

                        A: Refreshments may be served dependent on the location. Some locations may provide a light snack and/or refreshments.
                    
Q: When can I enroll in a Medicare health plan?

                        A: There are two basic times to enroll. Open Enrollment Period (OEP) runs from October 15 through December 7. Some individuals may qualify for a Special Election Period (SEP), where they can enroll throughout the year. Reasons for qualifying for a SEP include:
                        
You recently moved to a new service area
You qualify for extra help with your prescription drugs
You are on Medicare and Medicaid


Q: What happens if I request a consultation?

                        A: You will be given the opportunity to learn about your Medicare plan options through face-to-face interaction with a UnitedHealthcare Medicare Solutions licensed sales agent. During these meetings you can explore your options and receive advice from a local agent who can help you enroll in the plan that may best meet your needs.

What Our Customers Are Saying About Robin Hastings


 This group of guys did an amazing job. Very courteous, cleaned up after themselves, and the trees look amazing. Thank you Robin for the saplings they will be a great addition to the flora and fauna.


                      
David J., Surrey, BC



 Staff was friendly, polite, and professional. Work was done efficiently and the site cleaned. The representative, Robin, is quite knowledgeable and informative and I appreciated his recommendations. 
                      
Jim G., Delta BC



 Robin is knowledgeable and a good resource for answering questions we had about the process involved in dealing with our trees. We also appreciated his assistance with the paperwork needed to get a permit to have a tree removed. This streamlined the process in dealing with the city. The crew that did the removal was very professional. They treated our property with respect. The birch tree was safely removed, and the cleanup was very well done. On the occasions when I have had to call the office, I have found Anna to be very helpful and pleasant to deal with. She was able to answer questions for me when Robin was out in the field and she was able to find out about the timeline between submission of application to a possible date when it would be processed. 
                      
Kathy L., Surrey BC



 Robin was amazing to work with. His knowledge and understanding makes him a trusted advisor. We wouldn't think of using any other company. The work crew was also extremely knowledgable and efficient. 
                      
Bernie S., Surrey, BC
