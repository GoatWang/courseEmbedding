Learn MoreLearn More  Metromile  Insurance – Pay-per-mile – 2016 Drive less. Save big. Pay-per-mile car insurance is saving our customers an average of $500 annually.  Call an agent at 65%of drivers overpay to subsidize high mileage drivers.Traditional car insurance is unfair to low-mileage drivers. The number one risk indicator for drivers is how often they’re on the road. So if you’re already driving less, you should really start paying less.Save an average of $500 per yearDrive less, pay lessPay-per-mile insurance costs less because it’s based on how many miles you drive. If you spend less time behind the wheel, you spend less money on insurance. How per-mile insurance worksWith pay-per-mile insurance you pay a low monthly base rate plus a few cents per mile when you drive. At the end of the month, your bill is your base rate plus how many miles you drove at your per-mile rate. Just like with other insurance companies, several factors can influence your rate, including age, type of vehicle, and driver history.Per-mile rate$16.00500 miles driven x 3.2¢ per mileBase rate$30.00Flat monthly rateMonthly total$46.00Base rate + per-mile rate Rates vary with driver See Metromile In-Action  All miles over 150/day are freeRoad trip for lessWith pay-per-mile insurance, you aren’t charged for the miles you drive above 150/day (250/day in Illinois, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington). So if you go on a long trip, you’ll save big. Designed to over-deliver Even though you’re paying less, you can still have the same great coverage that you are used to. We’re working non-stop to make sure you have a best-in-class experience every time you interact with Metromile. From the always available (24/7) claims team to our industry-leading customer service, we promise to change the way you feel about car insurance. Take a closer look at claims Bodily injuryProperty damageUninsured and under­insured motorist coverageCollisionComprehensivePersonal injury protection/ medical payments coverageRental reimburse­mentEmergency road­side assistance$250, $500, and $1000 deductible optionsMeasuring milesThe key to pay-per-mile insurance is the Metromile Pulse, a small free wireless device that plugs into your car’s OBD-II port. Installation is easy, and once in place the Metromile Pulse securely counts your miles to determine your total monthly bill. Pay-per-mile insurance doesn’t consider other driving factors such as how fast you drive or how hard you brake, just how many miles you drive.We take privacy seriously, and will never sell your information to third parties.  Modern tools for the modern driver With the Metromile Pulse in place, you have unlimited access to our smart driving app. This means you can keep track of your trips, monitor your car’s health and always know where your car is parked. Check out the app Coming soon to a road near youPer-mile insurance is currently available in California, Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington but we are rapidly expanding into other states.  Join the waitlist  Answers to all your insurance related questions For more information, call 1.888.244.1702 or fill out this online form to get in touch. See all of our FAQsDo you offer full coverage?Yes, we offer four different levels of liability protection as well as choices for your comprehensive and collision deductibles. Please keep in mind that financing and leasing companies may have their own coverage requirements, so please verify before choosing your coverage limits.Can I have more than one vehicle on my policy? Is there a multi-car discount?Yes. You can add multiple vehicles while completing a quote online. Our multi-car discount will save you money on each vehicle’s base rate and per-mile rate. If you’re already a policyholder, please give us a call and we can update your policy.How are the base and per-mile rates determined?Just like other insurance companies, several factors are considered when creating your unique base and per-mile rate. These can include: driver age, credit history (state specific), type of vehicle, driver history, and length of prior insurance (state specific).What if I drive over 10,000 miles? Will my rate go up?You will never be penalized or have your rate increase purely because of an increase in annual miles. You are allowed to drive as much as you’d like, but just keep in mind that you will be charged for each mile that you drive up to 250/day (150/day in New Jersey).How does billing work?You’re charged for your first month’s base rate when you purchase a policy, plus any required prepayment. At the end of the first month, you’ll be charged for the next month’s base rate as well as any miles driven during the previous month. That way, you’ll only receive one bill each month. We also set you up for automatic billing when you first sign up, so there’s no need to worry about missed payments.

Group Car Insurance



If your employer offers MetLife Auto & Home's group car insurance program as part of your employee benefits, you could receive special savings. Some membership associations have discounts, too.

 Find out if you're eligible:


 GO 







Group discounts. Most people saved an average of $536 per year!3 We can offer these savings because your employer provides you access to a group insurance program with special low rates as part of your employee benefits.
Coverage that stays with you. If you retire, leave your company or go on leave, you can still continue your coverage without interruption or change.
Great features. Even though the policy's cheaper, you'll still have access to all our policy benefits. These include replacement coverage for total loss, rewards for good driving, enhanced rental car damage coverage, identify theft protection and more.2

MetLife Auto & Home®: Auto Safety Features




        FAQs 
      




 What types of basic auto insurance coverage does MetLife Auto & Home offer?








MetLife Auto & Home® offers a wide variety of coverage options, including:

Liability protection, which pays claims if you're responsible for an accident that causes bodily injuries and property damage.
Collision and comprehensive coverage, which pays for damage to your car if it hit another vehicle or object, no matter who caused the accident.4 It also pays for damage to your car caused by events like theft, vandalism, fire, flood, and hail.
Personal injury protection, which covers the costs of doctors, hospitals, and funeral expenses for you, members of your household, and/or your passengers, if a covered accident occurs, no matter who was at fault. You'll also be protected when you drive another person's car (with permission) or if a vehicle hits you or a family member as pedestrians.4
Uninsured motorists coverage, which pays the cost of damages and injuries resulting from being hit by an uninsured or hit-and-run driver. Coverage for both you and your passengers includes medical expenses, lost wages, and other injury-related losses.4
Underinsured motorists coverage, which pays for damages if you're injured in an accident caused by someone who doesn't have enough insurance to cover your medical expenses.





What other types of coverage are available?








MetLife Auto & Home® offers a wide variety of coverage options, including:

Rental car coverage. This will pay costs to the rental agency if you have an accident driving a rental car.
New car replacement. If you total your new car within one year of purchase or during the first 15,000 miles—whichever comes first—you get it repaired or it will be replaced with a new car with no deduction for depreciation.5
Special parts replacement. We'll pay to replace certain major parts—like tire, brakes and batteries--no matter what their wear-and-tear/depreciated value at the time of the accident.6
Glass repairs without a deductible. If your windshield is chipped or cracked, we'll repair it and waive your deductible.
Towing and roadside assistance and labor cost coverage. If your car breaks down while traveling, this can help reimburse you for towing and other roadside-assistance expenses.
Legal defense costs. If you're sued, we'll cover your legal fees. We'll also reimburse you for up to $200 per day for lost wages, if you attend a hearing or trial at our request.
Lease/loan gap coverage. Your vehicle's lease or loan will be paid off if your vehicle is a total loss due to an accident, even if the amount exceeds the value of your vehicle.





 What types of car insurance discounts and rewards does MetLife Auto & Home offer?









Deductible Savings Benefit. Automatically earn $50 every year you don't make a claim (to a maximum of $250) that may be used toward your deductible, if you have a covered loss.1
Defensive Driver Discount. Earn up to a 7% discount by completing a qualifying driver training course, like the one on the National Safety Council website.7
Superior Driver Discounts and MetRewards. Earn up to a 12% Superior Driver Discount if all of the drivers in your household have outstanding driving records, or up to 20% off your policy through the MetRewards program, if you are claim and violation-free for 5 years.8
Bundle and save. Save up to 10% with our multi-product and multi-policy discounts for having home as well as auto insurance with us. Check out our Bundle and Save page for more details! Sample multi-policy discounts:
          
Auto/Home multi-policy discount: 10%
Auto/Life multi-policy discount: 5% 9
 
Good Student Discount. Your star high school or college student could earn you a 15% discount if he or she qualifies.





 If I have a group policy, what happens if I retire, go on leave or change companies?








No worries! Your policy and coverage will continue without interruption, subject to policy terms and conditions. You'd be able to pay your insurance premiums through our EFT payment plan, by credit or debit card, through bills received by mail, or, in some cases, by pension deduction. If your premium is currently deducted from your paycheck and you go on short-term disability, like parental leave, your coverage stays in effect throughout your leave (subject to policy terms). If you were on payroll deduction and you're not receiving a regular paycheck from your employer, you'll receive a bill directly by mail.10




 What's the process for reporting an accident and filing a claim?








To file a claim with MetLife Auto & Home, call 1-800-854-6011—we're open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. If you need to file a claim against another driver, you'll need to contact that person's insurance company or agent and give the other company your insurance information. If you purchased collision coverage, you won't have to wait for the other driver to pay for damages: we will pay for damage to your car minus your deductible, regardless of who is at fault. Depending on the claim, you may be assigned a primary adjuster who conducts a thorough investigation of the accident, a field adjuster who appraises your car vehicle, a total loss specialist who finalizes the vehicle value, and a medical payments/personal injury protection adjuster who handles medical bills, like emergency room visits. If your repair shop finds additional damage that wasn't included in the original estimate, your repair shop will advise the appraiser, who will then write up a supplemental estimate that includes the additional damage. A second check is issued for the additional damage.         




My lienholder is showing up on the claim I've reported and/or the claim check. What should I do?








If you've paid off your auto loan but your lienholder is showing up on the claim reported, contact your primary claim adjuster right away. You will be asked to mail or fax a copy of your vehicle's title with the stamp indicating that the lien was discharged. The claim adjuster will forward the copy of the title to our service center, which will update your policy automatically. If you lease your vehicle or if you are still making loan payments, the leasing company or lienholder must be listed on the claim check. To cash the check, simply contact your lienholder's or leasing company's customer service department to find out how it will arrange to endorse the check. Once it has been endorsed, you may deposit it into your bank account.

What is life insurance and why do I need it?








A death in the family is not only emotionally devastating, it can also take a tremendous toll on the future financial security of a family. Suddenly, without the deceased’s income, paying the mortgage or providing for a child's college education may become much more difficult.   
Those who buy life insurance do so to help ensure their loved ones are taken care of financially. Life insurance is a promise by an insurance company to pay those who depend on you a sum of money upon your death. In return, you make periodic payments called premiums. Premiums can be based on factors such as age, gender, medical history and the dollar amount of the life insurance you purchase.
In the event of your passing, life insurance provides money directly to the individuals you select, your beneficiaries, who can use the money as they see fit, including:

Replacing lost income
Covering basic living expenses
Paying household debts, estate taxes and funeral expenses
Funding a child’s education
Supplementing retirement savings





What kinds of life insurance can I get at work?








Life insurance comes in two main types – term and permanent – which may both be available through your workplace.
Term life insurance pays a specific lump sum to your loved ones for a specified period of time – usually from one to 20 years. If you stop paying premiums, the insurance stops. Term policies pay benefits if you die during the period covered by the policy, but they do not build cash value. They may also give you the option to port. That is, you can take the coverage with you if you leave your company.
Generally, you should consider a term life insurance policy to:

Get valuable coverage at an affordable price
Help cover specific financial responsibilities like a mortgage or college expenses
Supplement a permanent policy

 Permanent life insurance policies do not expire. They are intended to protect your loved ones permanently, as long as you pay your premiums. Some permanent life insurance policies accumulate cash value. That means, the value of the policy will grow each year, tax-deferred, until it matches the face value of the policy. The cash can generally be accessed via loans or withdrawals, and can be used for a variety of purposes. This type of plan is typically portable so coverage can continue if employment terminates. 
Consider a permanent insurance policy if you want:

Protection for life
Payments that stay the same each year
To put additional money into the policy on a tax-favored basis
Cash value you can use while you are living





What are the advantages of purchasing life insurance through work?








Getting life insurance through work can be an easy way to protect your family. If your employer offers a group plan, consider signing up for advantages that may include:

Competitive group rates
Guaranteed issue, meaning you can get a certain amount of coverage without answering health questions or taking a medical exam
Convenient payroll deductions
Easy access to enrollment and educational tools that can help you make the right decisions about the type and amount of insurance that’s right for you
The confidence of knowing that your employer has reviewed and selected the plan

 All you have to do is sign up, and sometimes enrollment is automatic.




How much life insurance do I need?








While you won’t be able to pinpoint the amount you’ll need to the penny, you can make a sound estimate.  Your goal should be to develop a life insurance plan that, following your death, will allow your family to live comfortably without your economic contribution. Also consider the effect of inflation over time. The amount needed for retirement or college 20 years from now is likely to be significantly higher than today.
To estimate the amount of life insurance your family would need, first calculate everything you now provide for your family including:

Salary
Benefits/health insurance
401(k) and retirement savings
Personal services you perform for your family, such as child care, cooking, home maintenance, etc.

 Then, subtract your personal expenses including:

Annual spending on personal needs, such as food, clothing, entertainment, etc.





How much does life insurance cost?








Life insurance through your workplace may be more affordable than you think. In fact, many people can get term life insurance coverage from a quality company for a surprisingly low price.1
Premiums are typically based on factors such as:

Age, sex, height and weight
Health status, including whether or not you smoke
Participation in high-risk occupations

 Life insurance gets more expensive as you get older, and the type of coverage you choose will also affect your premium. Rates for term insurance are typically lower, while rates for permanent policies are typically higher.




Does MetLife offer an individual one year term life insurance product?








Yes.  MetLife’s one year term products offer affordable protection when you require insurance for the short term. These products are designed to provide the right amount of protection when it’s needed most, or to supplement a policy you already have. Premium rates can be found here. For more information contact MetLife's Specialized Benefit Resources at 877-638-3932, and press 2 for New Business.




What are the tax advantages of life insurance?








Death benefits are generally received income tax-free by your beneficiaries. In the case of permanent life insurance policies, cash values accumulate on an income tax-deferred basis. That means you would not have to pay income tax on any of the policy’s earnings as long as the policy remains in effect. In addition, most policy loans and withdrawals are not taxable (although withdrawals and loans will reduce the cash value and death benefit).2

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]

MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

Corporate structure[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (December 2015)


As of 2010[update], the company was "organized into five segments: Insurance Products, Retirement Products," the US Business (including Auto & Home and Corporate Benefit Funding), and International.[14] The Insurance Products division was the largest unit, accounting for 53% of 2009 revenue.[15] By 2015, a division referred to as "Americas" had emerged.[2]
Corporate governance[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2015)


As of 2011, MetLife's chief executive officer was Steve Kandarian.[16] Kandarian also served as the company's chairman of the board and president as of 2015.[2]
Hired in 2013, John Hele served as chief financial officer for the company as of 2015.[2]
In 2015, MetLife hired Hugh Dineen to fill the new role of chief marketing officer within the US Business Unit.[17]
As in many large, public corporations, MetLife has a compensation committee which establishes compensation levels for the company's senior executives; MetLife compensation emphasizes "variable performance-based compensation over fixed or guaranteed pay".[2]
Subsidiary and affiliate companies[edit]
MetLife subsidiaries and affiliates have included MetLife Investors, MetLife Bank, MetLife Securities, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, General American, Hyatt Legal, MetLife Resources, New England Financial, Walnut Street Securities, Inc., Safeguard Health Enterprises, Inc., and Tower Square Securities, Inc., Cigna.[18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26]
The subsidiary MetLife Insurance Company USA, as of 2015 headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, was formerly known as MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut, and prior to this as Travelers Insurance Company.[27][28]
MetLife Bank was sold to GE Capital in 2013, and MetLife exited the banking business.[29]
History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

Learn MoreLearn More  Metromile  Insurance – Pay-per-mile – 2016 Drive less. Save big. Pay-per-mile car insurance is saving our customers an average of $500 annually.  Call an agent at 65%of drivers overpay to subsidize high mileage drivers.Traditional car insurance is unfair to low-mileage drivers. The number one risk indicator for drivers is how often they’re on the road. So if you’re already driving less, you should really start paying less.Save an average of $500 per yearDrive less, pay lessPay-per-mile insurance costs less because it’s based on how many miles you drive. If you spend less time behind the wheel, you spend less money on insurance. How per-mile insurance worksWith pay-per-mile insurance you pay a low monthly base rate plus a few cents per mile when you drive. At the end of the month, your bill is your base rate plus how many miles you drove at your per-mile rate. Just like with other insurance companies, several factors can influence your rate, including age, type of vehicle, and driver history.Per-mile rate$16.00500 miles driven x 3.2¢ per mileBase rate$30.00Flat monthly rateMonthly total$46.00Base rate + per-mile rate Rates vary with driver See Metromile In-Action  All miles over 150/day are freeRoad trip for lessWith pay-per-mile insurance, you aren’t charged for the miles you drive above 150/day (250/day in Illinois, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington). So if you go on a long trip, you’ll save big. Designed to over-deliver Even though you’re paying less, you can still have the same great coverage that you are used to. We’re working non-stop to make sure you have a best-in-class experience every time you interact with Metromile. From the always available (24/7) claims team to our industry-leading customer service, we promise to change the way you feel about car insurance. Take a closer look at claims Bodily injuryProperty damageUninsured and under­insured motorist coverageCollisionComprehensivePersonal injury protection/ medical payments coverageRental reimburse­mentEmergency road­side assistance$250, $500, and $1000 deductible optionsMeasuring milesThe key to pay-per-mile insurance is the Metromile Pulse, a small free wireless device that plugs into your car’s OBD-II port. Installation is easy, and once in place the Metromile Pulse securely counts your miles to determine your total monthly bill. Pay-per-mile insurance doesn’t consider other driving factors such as how fast you drive or how hard you brake, just how many miles you drive.We take privacy seriously, and will never sell your information to third parties.  Modern tools for the modern driver With the Metromile Pulse in place, you have unlimited access to our smart driving app. This means you can keep track of your trips, monitor your car’s health and always know where your car is parked. Check out the app Coming soon to a road near youPer-mile insurance is currently available in California, Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington but we are rapidly expanding into other states.  Join the waitlist  Answers to all your insurance related questions For more information, call 1.888.244.1702 or fill out this online form to get in touch. See all of our FAQsDo you offer full coverage?Yes, we offer four different levels of liability protection as well as choices for your comprehensive and collision deductibles. Please keep in mind that financing and leasing companies may have their own coverage requirements, so please verify before choosing your coverage limits.Can I have more than one vehicle on my policy? Is there a multi-car discount?Yes. You can add multiple vehicles while completing a quote online. Our multi-car discount will save you money on each vehicle’s base rate and per-mile rate. If you’re already a policyholder, please give us a call and we can update your policy.How are the base and per-mile rates determined?Just like other insurance companies, several factors are considered when creating your unique base and per-mile rate. These can include: driver age, credit history (state specific), type of vehicle, driver history, and length of prior insurance (state specific).What if I drive over 10,000 miles? Will my rate go up?You will never be penalized or have your rate increase purely because of an increase in annual miles. You are allowed to drive as much as you’d like, but just keep in mind that you will be charged for each mile that you drive up to 250/day (150/day in New Jersey).How does billing work?You’re charged for your first month’s base rate when you purchase a policy, plus any required prepayment. At the end of the first month, you’ll be charged for the next month’s base rate as well as any miles driven during the previous month. That way, you’ll only receive one bill each month. We also set you up for automatic billing when you first sign up, so there’s no need to worry about missed payments. If you ever need to update your billing information, you can login to your online account.  × ErrorWe've encountered an error processing your request.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

            There is no paperwork or medical exam required.
        

            Visitors insurance plans are not Affordable Care Act (ACA) compliant.
        

            While name and date of birth are required in all travel insurance plans, passport number is optional in some of them.
        

            Visitors medical insurance can start as early as the next day or any future date you specify.
        

            Most plans have pre-existing conditions exclusions. Make sure to read the certificate wording carefully.
        














            Visitors Insurance for USA
        

            Visitors insurance primarily provides coverage if you were to unexpectedly get sick or injured while visiting United States.
        


        What does visitors insurance include?
    

        Visitors insurance may be comprised of various benefits, some of these standard benefits may include:
    














                        Emergency Medical Expenses
                    
Visitors insurance will generally cover any new medical conditions, injuries or accidents that may occur after the effective date of the policy. Medical expenses are very high in the United States. While fixed coverage plans provide limited coverage according to schedule of benefits, comprehensive coverage provides the coverage in terms of percentage (80%, 90% and so on).





                        PPO Network
                    
Most comprehensive coverage plans participate in a PPO network which has many participating doctors or hospitals all over the U.S. that bill the insurance company directly and also charge you only the network negotiated fees.


                            Learn More






                        Acute Onset of Pre-Existing Conditions
                    
Many visitors insurance plans provide coverage for acute onset of pre-existing conditions up to certain extent for persons below a certain age. This benefit is immensely helpful for elderly visitors to the U.S. who may be suffering from pre-existing conditions. It is meant to cover sudden and unexpected emergencies and not meant to cover routine maintenance of pre-existing conditions.


                            Learn More






                        Trip Interruption
                    
In case you need to return back to your home country prematurely due to covered reasons; such as your house is on fire or flooded; trip interruption coverage will help you pay for the additional expenses to make necessary arrangements.





                        Emergency Medical Evacuation / Repatriation
                    
In case you were to become seriously sick or injured in a remote location while on your trip, emergency medical evacuation would transport you to the nearest medical facility where adequate care can be given. Once you are stable enough to travel, it may also pay for you to return to your home country.


                            Learn More






                        Return of Mortal Remains
                    
Return of mortal remains would pay for transportation of your remains or local cremation if you were to pass away while on your trip.


                            Learn More






                        Loss of Checked Luggage
                    
If the airline were to permanently lose your checked luggage, this benefit would help pay for the essentials that would be immediately necessary upon your arrival to the destination.





                        Accidental Death & Dismemberment
                    
This coverage would provide lump sum amount to you or your family if you were to become dismembered or passed away in an accident. Some plans provide coverage only while traveling in a common carrier, such as a plane, bus, or train.

        Travel Insurance Coverage Options
    

        Depending on what is most important for you to have covered, there may be a plan better tailored to your needs:
    









                    Trip Cancellation Insurance
                


                Trip cancellation insurance primarily provides coverage for prepaid non-refundable expenses in case you need to cancel your trip for covered reasons. While many plans are available only to U.S. residents, some are available to non-U.S. residents.

                    Annual Multi-Trip Insurance
                


                If you are taking multiple short trips throughout the year, you should consider annual travel insurance instead of buying insurance for every trip. You don’t have to remember to buy the insurance for your every trip and it provides a higher amount of coverage at a lower price.

                    Dental Plan
                


                Many visitors medical insurance plans provide no dental coverage and some provide limited coverage only in case of accidents. Dental and Vision plans are low cost and they complement the visitors medical plans.

                    Group Travel Insurance
                


                Individual visitors insurance plans are meant for individual and families. For group of 5 travelers or more that will be traveling together and have the same travel dates, it is worthwhile to look at the group travel insurance plans. They provide the same coverage as the individual plans but are usually 10% cheaper.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
