      challenges represented by the growth of internet and wireless

      capabilities.

    


      "Luis is a strong addition to our Board," said EA CEO John Riccitiello.

      "He brings a deep understanding of digital opportunities in media and

      entertainment, and an impressive mix of strategic and operational

      management experience."

    


      Mr. Ubiñas serves on several boards and advisory committees, including

      the World Bank Advisory Council of Global Foundation Leaders and the UN

      Permanent Advisory Memorial Committee. He has been nominated by

      and Negotiation. He is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard

      Business School, and is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and

      Sciences.

    


      "As we welcome Luis, I also want to express our gratitude to Gary Kusin,

      who retires from the EA Board today after over fifteen years of

      distinguished contribution," continued John Riccitiello. "During his

      tenure, including his time as lead director from 2006 to 2009, Gary has

      brought invaluable insight to Electronic Arts."

LIVONIA, Mich., Nov. 26, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Valassis (NYSE:   VCI), one of the nation's leading media and marketing services companies, announced today the appointment of Luis A. Ubinas, president of the Ford Foundation, to the Valassis Board of Directors, effective Nov. 26, 2012. With a distinguished record of leadership in both the profit and nonprofit sectors, Ubinas brings a strong background in media including how digital and emerging technologies are transforming ways we communicate.
In his role at the Ford Foundation, the second largest philanthropic foundation in the United States, he helped to more clearly define the foundation's objectives and streamline its global operations.  With over $10.5 billion in assets and $500 million in annual giving, the Foundation operates worldwide and has offices in Asia and Africa as well as Central and South America. Under his direction, he helped place greater emphasis on demonstrating the impact of the Foundation's programs.
As president of the Ford Foundation since 2008, Ubinas has built a program strategy focused on how new technology and social media can reshape the way nonprofits deliver results for those they serve. To maximize the resources available to grantees, Ubinas also led the restructuring of the Foundation's operations and endowment management. 
"Luis brings to our board a wealth of experience in driving transformational change," said Alan F. Schultz, Valassis Chairman of the Board. "His board expertise will help guide our efforts to innovate and enhance the value we deliver to clients and consumers."
Prior to joining the Ford Foundation, Ubinas was a director at McKinsey & Company, leading the firm's media practice on the West Coast. He served technology, telecommunications and media companies, working with them to develop and implement strategies and improve operations. While at McKinsey, he led research on the impact of new technologies on business, and much of his work focused on the opportunities and challenges represented by the growth of Internet and wireless technologies. He has spoken extensively on trends in the communications arena.
Ubinas serves on several nonprofit, government and corporate boards and advisory committees, including the High Level Task Force for the International Conference on Population and Development, the Advisory Committee for the U.S.-China 100,000 Strong Initiative and the boards of the New York Public Library and the Collegiate School for Boys. He also serves on the Board of Electronic Arts and on the U.S. Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiation.
Ubinas is a graduate of Harvard College, where he was named a Truman Scholar, and Harvard Business School, where he graduated with highest honors. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
