FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Better Buy: TransEnterix, Inc. vs. Medtronic
Which is the better medical device stock to buy right now?











                George Budwell
            

                (TMFGBudwell)



            
            Nov 30, 2016 at 9:42AM
            
            





Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSEMKT:TRXC) both appear to be well-positioned to benefit from an aging global population and longer life spans, both of which should drive a sizable uptick in the demand for medical devices in the coming decades. Let's take a closer look at which company offers investors the better means of taking advantage of this demographic tailwind moving forward. 

Image source: Getty Images.
Medtronic is a mature medical device company
Although a large-cap dividend aristocrat stock like Medtronic may sound like a boring pick compared to an up-and-comer like TransEnterix, there really is more than meets the eye with this top medical device company.
First off, Medtronic has a solid track record of posting modest single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth (when excluding the impact of any non-GAAP adjustments). Moreover, the company's headfirst foray into the mergers and acquisitions scene over the last six years has vastly broadened its global footprint, commercial portfolio, and overall scale, transforming it into the world's largest medical technology company.
This year, Medtronic has been working toward integrating these various acquisitions and streamlining its overall operations in order to improve profitability and increase its free cash flows going forward. And, if all goes as planned, the company should have the ability to continue upping its quarterly dividend on a regular basis in the years to come, as well as remain a leader in terms of innovation. 

Image source: Medtronic.
Beyond its already healthy and still-improving fundamental picture, Medtronic also sports a diverse product portfolio consisting of implantable cardiac devices, a range of diabetes care products, and numerous other therapies that span the entire patient care continuum, from diagnosis to recovery. Put simply, Medtronic isn't a one-trick pony, which gives it a highly diversified revenue stream that can withstand the typical ebbs and flows of the global medical device market.
TransEnterix is a speculative bet on the red-hot robotic surgery market
TransEnterix is a small-cap robotic surgery company that offers tremendous upside potential -- yet stomach-wrenching levels of risk as well.
The company's story revolves around its two robotic surgery platforms: Senhance (previously known as the ALF-X system) that sports CE Mark approval in the European Union for minimally invasive surgery procedures, and the developmental-stage SurgiBot System that's designed to go head-to-head against Intuitive Surgical's market-leading da Vinci surgical system.
The crux of the situation is that Senhance's commercialization in the EU remains in its nascent stages, with the company selling its first unit in Italy earlier this year. And, it's entirely unclear when, if ever, the FDA will clear the Surgibot System for sale inside the United States.
TransEnterix has tried to remain upbeat about the state of Surgibot's regulatory dance with the FDA. But the company simply hasn't been able to say anything definitive since the device's 510(k) submission was pushed back for its failure to meet the criteria for substantial equivalence to another previously approved product earlier this year.
So, with a dwindling cash pile that probably won't last past 2017, the company appears ripe for a sizable secondary offering sometime soon. Perhaps more worrisome, TransEnterix's core value proposition depends entirely on its ability to successfully navigate the FDA regulatory maze to break into the multibillion-dollar robotic surgery market -- a task it has yet to achieve. And that's before going head-to-head against the established market leader.





Which stock is the better buy?
In this match up, Medtronic is arguably a far better buy due to its stable cash flows, impressive product portfolio, and quarterly payout. TransEnterix, after all, has yet to even break into the all-important U.S. market, and its ultimate game plan is to take on the 800-pound gorilla that is Intuitive Surgical once its does so. That's a tall order for a small-cap company with extremely limited resources -- even if SurgiBot truly is a superior product to Intuitive's da Vinci surgical system.

How Risky Is TransEnterix, Inc.?
Find out if the first sale of its only marketable product makes this troubled robotic-surgery stock a buy.

It's been a wild year for robotic-surgery stock TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSEMKT:TRXC). Last September the company spent a great deal acquiring the ALF-X System while waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make a decision regarding its main project at the time, the SurgiBot System.
The purchase raised some eyebrows, but without it TransEnterix would have nothing to sell right now. In April, the FDA declared the SurgiBot not equivalent to existing devices and refused to grant it clearance.
The ALF-X earned EU marketing approval (known as the CE mark) long before TransEnterix bought it, and just ahead of reporting second-quarter earnings the company announced its first sale. 
Does the sale signal a smooth path to profitability, or is Transenterix as risky as ever? Read on to find out.





Bleak beginnings
The ALF-X earned EU marketing approval in 2011, but its previous owner, Italy's Sofar, never sold one. To be fair, Sofar mainly markets pharmaceutical products and dietary supplements, with a minor medical-device presence. There's a chance its launch failed because of a lack of effort on Sofar's part, but success under TransEnterix's ownership is hardly a sure thing.

There are reasons to suspect ramping up demand for ALF-X in the EU will be more difficult than expected. The company is up against firmly entrenched robotic-surgery pioneer Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) and its Da Vinci line of devices that sell for around $1.5 million each, with newer models as much as $2.5 million. The ALF-X costs roughly $1.8 million but promises lower per-procedure costs than Da Vinci systems by allowing surgeons to reuse instruments. According to TransEnterix CEO Todd Pope, Intuitive Surgical has been peddling older, refurbished devices at steep discounts, diminishing ALF-X's ability to compete on price.
Whether hospitals aren't interested in the ALF-X or are simply being won over by Intuitive Surgical strategy isn't clear, but it's probably a combination of both. What we do know is that TransEnterix began its ALF-X selling efforts in the fourth quarter of 2015 but didn't announce the first "sale" until late last month. That might not be as bad as it sounds, as management expects hospitals to spend four to six quarters with the device on site before pulling the trigger, implying an unspecified trial period allowed prior to official purchase. That means it's still too early to issue ALF-X a European death certificate.





The device isn't cleared for marketing in the U.S., although the company intends to file an application for 501(k) clearance by the end of the year. If approved, U.S. sales could begin in 2017, but that clearance is far from guaranteed.
In the numbers
The most encouraging tidbit from the second-quarter earnings call was a steep increase in hospital interest. In the first quarter, management said surgeons representing 10 hospitals had participated in a hands-on demonstration. During the second quarter, surgeons from 21 hospitals gave the ALF-X a test drive. However, management didn't say how many of those demos resulted in hospital placements that could eventually lead to sales.
A far less encouraging figure to point to in the second quarter was an enormous writedown of about $61.8 million in goodwill associated with the SurgiBot system's implosion. Overall, TransEnterix reported a staggering loss of $82.4 million during the three months ended in June.
Goodwill impairment is a non-cash charge, allowing TransEnterix to exit the quarter with $64.6 million in cash and equivalents, which should be enough to see it through the third quarter of next year. Despite its decent cash position, though, I expect that more share dilution lies ahead for investors. Even if all 31 hospitals to test drive an ALF-X this year end up buying one, it wouldn't cover the amount of cash operations are expected to burn through over the next year or so with R&D teams on two continents.






TRXC data by YCharts
If the stock is hovering near its recent price of $1.50 around this time next year, investors can expect their slice of any potential profits to evaporate, again. Of course, there's a chance the FDA might clear the ALF-X before then, and positive European sales figures could come rolling in. That news would almost certainly drive up the stock price and limit the number of shares the company will need to sell to keep its doors open.
Considering TransEnterix's track record, though, I wouldn't recommend betting on such success to the most adventurous investors. It's far too risky.
