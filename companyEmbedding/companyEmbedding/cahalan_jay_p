Insider Bets Paying Off At GCBC As New 52-Week High Reached






MarketNewsVideo.com




Jun 9, 2017 4:07 PM EDT













 


















































 In trading on Friday, shares of Greene County Bancorp Inc ( GCBC) touched a new 52-week high of $27.95/share. That's a 81.49% rise, or $12.55 per share from the 52-week low of $15.40 set back on 06/29/2016. That means at today's intraday high, any investor who purchased GCBC stock any time over the past 52 weeks has an unrealized gain, including company insiders.   Over the past six months, insiders have been scooping up shares, and those bets are now paying off handsomely. As summarized by the table below, GCBC has seen 3 different instances of insiders buying over the trailing six month period.

GCBC Ex-Dividend Reminder - 2/11/15
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 2/11/15, Greene County Bancorp Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.18, payable on 2/27/15. As a percentage of GCBC's recent stock price of $29.50, this dividend works out to approximately 0.61%, so look for shares of Greene County Bancorp Inc to trade 0.61% lower — all else being equal — when GCBC shares open for trading on 2/11/15.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
