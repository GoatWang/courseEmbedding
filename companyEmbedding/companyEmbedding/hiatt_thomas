Hiatt
		and Co. Ltd. A Possible History of Hiatt and its
		Birmingham Competitors 











Introduction Hiatt & Co.
								Ltd. Griffin Nichols T & A Longmore
Froggatt Field  
A Time Line   
    

 



				Introduction. The origins of Hiatt and Company Ltd. lie in the
				late eighteenth century, 1780, as stated in vintage and contemporary company
				advertisements. According to both the
				Hiatt and the
				American
				Hiatt-Thompson  web pages, the company was
				begun by a "Mr. Hiat" with one T. Supposedly he set up shop in 1780 at 26
				Masshouse Lane in Birmingham. 

"In the year 1780 when
				  Birmingham, England was little more than a village, any passer-by walking down
				  the well known thoroughfare called Masshouse Lane, might have stopped out of
				  curiosity to look at a new sign which had recently gone up at Number
				  26.
This intimated that a certain Mr.
				  Hiat was a maker of Prisoners' Handcuffs, Felons' Leg Irons and Gang Chains to
				  the Trade." 
This quote as taken from the
				Hiatt-Thompson web page. The quote
				originally comes from a newspaper article that appeared in the "Black
				County Survey" published in 1958. It was part of a series of articles
				devoted to the "Histories of Famous Firms." Although the article is fascinating
				to read, it gives no documentation for the company's earliest history. The
				article does make reference to entry for "Hiat" (with one T) in an 1832 trade
				directory.


Unfortunately this entire story
				seems to be mostly myth. Collectors have searched for and speculated about
				early Hiatt restraints. Shouldn't the earliest examples be marked "Hiat" with
				one T? As far as I know, no such cuffs have ever been found. 
It seemed that some original
				research was needed. I had two types of evidence to examine, written records in
				the form of old trade directories and advertisements, and actual examples of
				old handcuffs. A close examination of their markings revealed important
				clues.
The results of this research led me
				to write a book on the subject entitled, "British Handcuffs, A Collector's
				Guide to Vintage Handcuffs." The "possible history" that is presented here is
				based upon information that appears in this new book. The book also includes
				pictures of about a hundred vintage British handcuffs taken from my collection.
				 
 


 Hiatt & Co.
				Ltd. Perhaps the best documentation of early 19th century Birmingham
				are the early trade directories published by Wrightson. Significantly there is
				no mention of Hiatt in Wrightson's Triennial Directory of Birmingham, published
				in 1815. However, the 1815 directory does include a listing for Thomas Griffin
				and Co., horse and dog collar, fetter and gate lock makers, located on Digbeth
				Street. 
In 1818 Thomas Griffin Hiatt
				appears in the Wrightson Directory for the first time as a manufacturer of
				felon's irons and gate locks, located on Moor St. in Birmingham. Some time in
				the next few years Hiatt moved around the corner to 26 Masshouse Lane, where he
				is located in the next edition of the Wrightson's Birmingham directory as a
				manufacturer of felon's irons, gate lock, handcuffs, horse and dog collars. The
				Hiatt Company remained at the 26 Masshouse Lane address until the premises were
				destroyed by the World War II German bombing in 1941. 

As mentioned above the spelling of
				the name Hiatt, with one "t" or two is a matter of some confusion. Some
				sources, including the present day Hiatt web sites, claim that early cuffs were
				issued with only one "t" in the name. However, I have never seen a cuff marked
				with an original "Hiat" mark and I am not convinced that they exist.
				
 From
				Chris Gower's Collection  
Even cuffs marked with the very
				early "MOOR STREET BIRM" address have a Hiatt with two "t's" logo. One
				possible reason for the confusion is due to spelling errors in the Wrightson
				directories, the spelling is Hiatt in the 1818 and 1839 directories of the
				series, but in the intermediate years the name is listed as "Hiat," with one
				"t". These misspellings may be responsible for the one "t" myth. The
				directories are actually full of misspellings. In one place Hiatt name is
				listed as T. G. Hart.
A clue to Hiatt's earliest years
				may be found in his full name, Thomas Griffin Hiatt. There must be a
				relationship between Hiatt and the previously mentioned Thomas Griffin and Co.
				on Digbeth Street. Perhaps Thomas Griffin was Hiatt's grandfather and taught
				Hiatt the trade. According to an entry in Alex Nichols' book, examples of cuffs
				marked Hiatt and Griffin exist. Such cuffs may predate the independent Hiatt
				operation and represent work done by Thomas Griffin Hiatt working with Thomas
				Griffin and Co. 
The independent Hiatt Company
				prospered. By 1845 William John Hiatt was running the company and in 1858 the
				Dix Birmingham Directory contained this listing. 

"Hiatt William
				  John, (successor to the late Thos. Griffin Hiatt) handcuff manufacr to Her
				  Majesty's Honorable Board of Ordanace and original manufacturer of all kinds of
				  police and other handcuffs, police leg, and, travelling irons, police staves,
				  sabers, pistols rattles, and lanterns, 16 Masshouseln; h, Moseley rd.
				  Balsallheath"    
  


Griffin. The history of
				the Griffin handcuffs has been rather obscure, but it turns out that Griffin
				may be one of the most important Birmingham handcuff companies.

Products are known with the Griffin
				name only, but there are also cuffs marked Griffin & Nichols. And in
				addition according to the Alex Nichols book there are cuffs marked Hiatt &
				Griffin. How are these cuffs related? 
The story turns out to be rather
				fascinating. Griffin is certainly one of the earliest handcuffs companies. In
				Wrightson's Triennial Directory for 1815 there is a listing for Thomas Griffin
				and Co., horse and dog collar, fetter and gate lock makers, on Digbeth Street.
				This same directory does not have any listing for Hiatt. Since the directory is
				rather thorough, this suggests that perhaps the Hiatt Company did not exist in
				1815. 
Three years later the 1818
				directory lists a changed company name, Griffin appears to have taken a
				partner. The new company is Griffin & Nichols, at the same address and with
				the same products. (The name Griffin is misspelled in the 1818 directory, but
				correct in later editions.) The 1818 directory also lists T. G. Hiatt (Thomas
				Griffin Hiatt) as an irons and gate lock manufacturer, on Moor Street. This is
				the earliest directory listing for Hiatt. 
The similarity of the two names
				cannot be a coincidence. Thomas Griffin Hiatt and Thomas Griffin must have been
				related. Perhaps Griffin was Hiatt's grandfather. A family relationship would
				certainly explain the existence of cuffs marked Hiatt and Griffin. Indeed it is
				possible that the supposed 1780 beginning date for Hiatt & Co. Ltd. may
				actually be traced through some Griffin lineage. After all, it is significant
				that none of the existing literature can assign a name to the instigator of the
				Hiatt Company. The Hiatt web site simply refers to him a "Mr. Hiat", with one
				"t". Perhaps "Mr. Hiat" was actually "Mr. Griffin", Thomas Griffin (with two
				F's), Hiatt's grandfather or some other close relative. 

In 1823 Griffin & Nichols, are
				listed as makers of horse and dog collars, fetter, and D. locks, handcuffs and
				boot tips, at 62, Digbeth Street. The partnership between Griffin & Nichols
				was relatively short lived, and handcuffs marked Griffin & Nichols are
				rare. In the 1829 Birmingham directory, Griffin is gone and James Nichols is
				listed alone as a chain, horse and dog collar, and felon's iron maker, still at
				the Digbeth Street address. This double change in company names over about a
				fifteen-year period shows that that Griffin cuffs come first predating cuffs
				marked Griffin & Nichols. Nichols cuffs come later postdating the
				partnership.   
  


Nichols. The history of Nichols handcuffs is tied up
				with the history of Griffin and Hiatt. Sometime between 1815 and 1818 it
				appears that Thomas Griffin formed a partnership with James Nichols. The
				company was located in Birmingham on Digbeth Street. Sometime later in the late
				1820s the Griffin name was dropped and James Nichols becomes the sole
				proprietor of the Digbeth Street operation.

I have two types of Nichols
				handcuffs, a very nice back strap Darby, and a couple of pairs of standard
				Darby cuffs. They carry a characteristic curved Nichols trademark as shown
				above. One of my standard Darby handcuffs has the curved Nichols logo and the
				date 1859. This date is important because in 1861, the T & A Longmore
				Company placed an advertisement in the Birmingham corporate directory with a
				reference to the "Late James Nichols." The implication of the advertisement is
				that James Nichols has just left the business, likely due to his retirement or
				death, and that T & A Longmore has taken over the company. 
However, the story gets more
				complicated than this. I also have a pair nicely plated Nichols Darby handcuffs
				that look like they were made in the late nineteenth century or even the early
				twentieth. Significantly they do not have the curved Nichols trademark. Instead
				they have the Nichols name printed in bold letters along with an equally large
				Birmingham Police designation.

So how do we interpret this
				information? Perhaps there were two Nichols operations. One began with Griffin
				in the early nineteenth century and then ended with the death of James Nichols.
				The second separate operation, perhaps founded by another member of the same
				family, may have come into existence in the later nineteenth century. Or
				perhaps this odd Nichols cuff is not made by Nichols at all; maybe it was
				merely owned or sold by someone named Nichols. More research is
				needed.  
  


T & A
				Longmore. Thomas and Arthur Longmore were ironwork makers through out
				much of the mid nineteenth century. In the 1861 Corporation Birmingham
				directory, an advertisement for T & A Longmore appears listing them as
				manufacturers of police handcuffs. Most interesting is a reference to the "Late
				James Nichols." The address in Digbeth corresponds to the address listed for
				Griffin and Nichols in the early nineteenth century .

 This likely means that upon James
				Nichols' retirement or perhaps his death, the company that began as Thomas
				Griffin and Co. was purchased by T & A Longmore. However, it appears that
				the venture was very short lived. As soon as 1865, the Longmore handcuff
				references are gone from Birmingham directories and the Longmores are listed
				only as iron founders and "heavy steel toy manufacturers." 

Not surprisingly the T & A
				handcuffs appear to be very rare. The lone example I have in my collection is
				the only one I have ever seen.   
  


 Field.
				Field & Sons was also founded in the eighteenth century, but in London, not
				Birmingham. In the 1794 Directory of London and Westminster & Borough of
				Southwark, the company was listed as Field & Parker, located at 233 High
				Holborn, London. According to a note from Chris Gower, the name of the company
				changed to Parker, Field & Sons from 1842 -1877, although their products
				were often marked just Field, 233 Holborn, London. From 1877-1883 the company
				relocated to 59 Lehman Street and the company name changed to Field & Sons.
				At this point the company seems to have gone out of business. 

Field handcuffs are relatively
				plentiful, but most interestingly there is no real evidence that they ever
				manufactured cuffs. All their products are very similar to Hiatt products and
				it seems likely that Field simply acted as Hiatt's London agent. 
It is interesting to note a comment
				from Houdini made in the October 1906 issue of his Conjurer's Magazine. Houdini
				

"Herewith is presented the "Plug
				  eight Handcuff." This is an extraordinary broad one, was used in South Africa
				  during the Boer war, and they say the cuff is used on the Kaffir diamond
				  thieves. No matter how heavy the manacle may be, the locking arrangement is
				  generally the same. This cuff is made by Hiatt, of Birmingham, Froggatt of
				  Boardsley and the one time Handcuff maker Fields. Strange, but almost all of
				  the English cuffs are made in Birmingham or its vicinity."

In this quote Houdini refers to
				Fields as a former handcuff maker and implies that their cuffs came from
				Birmingham. But here is no evidence of a Fields operation in Birmingham, Hiatt
				most likely made cuffs of Fields.  
  


Froggatt. William West's 1830 Directory of Warwickshire
				lists William Froggatt, of 4 Court Bordesley St. Birmingham as a manufacturer
				of dog and horse collars and felon's iron maker. Later in the 1830s Froggatt
				moved to Bartholomew St. and then on to 289 Bradford Street where they
				remained. Ownership of the company stayed in the family and came eventually to
				William's grandson Thomas Froggatt, who was born in 1864. 
Thomas Froggatt & Co. became
				Hiatt's main competitor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
				In 1937 Thomas Froggatt sold the company to Hiatt, but Froggatt continued on as
				employee. He finally retired in 1948 at the age of 84, when Hiatt moved to
				their new suburban location on Baltimore Road, Great Barr. 
Thomas Froggatt was said to have
				been a good friend of Harry Houdini and to have supplied Houdini with many of
				the handcuffs and leg irons that he used in his act. 
Judged by the abundance and ease of
				finding Froggatt cuffs today, Froggatt sold a lot of handcuffs. In particular
				Froggatt Plug 8 cuffs are nearly as plentiful as are Hiatt Plug 8's. Froggatt
				must have also been a major exporter to America, because Froggatt cuffs turn up
				relatively frequently on this side of the Atlantic.
Other Companies.
				There were other Birmingham handcuffs companies in addition to those discussed
				here, Thompson, Dowler and Hudson are the most important. However, as far as I
				know they have no direct links to Hiatt. More details about these other
				companies can be found in my book.  
  


Time
				Line. The figure below shows an
				approximate time line for the various interlinked Birmingham handcuff
				companies. Remember this is a "possible history." Don't take anything you read
				here as fact. At least not until more research has been completed.
