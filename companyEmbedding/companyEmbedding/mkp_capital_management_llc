A Long-term Approach to Alternative Investing
 
 
MKP Capital Management, L.L.C. ("MKP®" or "Firm") is a diversified alternative investment manager with approximately $6 billion in assets under management and 100 employees in New York and London.  The Firm has operated with a long-term approach to investing since its founding in 1995.  MKP invests across global markets, including rates, currencies, credit, equities and commodities through its discretionary global macro and credit strategies.  MKP advises a variety of commingled and customized vehicles. Each investment strategy shares the objective of producing high risk-adjusted returns over the long term in a risk-controlled manner. MKP believes that business integrity and transparency are an essential and uncompromising part of its business model.  
 
  


Collaborative approach
MKP’s collaborative approach seeks to yield superior economic insights across its investment platform. The collaborative approach seeks to ensure that ideas and creativity are leveraged across the strategies below to the benefit of investors:
Global Macro – top-down fundamental approach to identify and exploit economic and financial
imbalances in asset markets
Credit – core strategies include Agency and non-Agency residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, corporate capital structure and collateralized loan obligations 
  

Risk management culture
MKP Capital is built upon a risk management culture that seeks to assist the firm in achieving its goal of providing absolute returns while minimizing drawdowns in varying investment climates.  MKP targets risk rather than return in order to preserve capital with the intention of generating stable returns over the long-term. MKP’s infrastructure, including an independent risk group led by our Chief Risk Officer, continually monitors all portfolio, market, and counterparty risks. 

Integrity and transparency
Integrity and transparency are essential and uncompromising components of MKP’s business model. MKP has a distinctive culture built on six core values, and over a 20-year history. MKP Capital’s principals are personally invested in the firm’s success.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
