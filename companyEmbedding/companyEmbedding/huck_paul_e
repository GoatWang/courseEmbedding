Huck has served as CFO since 2004 and has been responsible for Air Products’ Finance, Investor Relations, Information Technology, Business Support Services, and Mergers and Acquisitions organizations and has served on company’s Corporate Executive Committee. He joined the company in 1979 after serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy and served as a controller for several company businesses before being named corporate controller in 1994. 

John McGlade, Air Products’ chairman, president and CEO said, “Paul Huck has exemplified the best of everything Air Products stands for. The company has grown tremendously during his distinguished tenure, and he has been a key player every step of the way as a leader, trusted colleague and member of the Corporate Executive Committee. Through his careful mentoring of Scott and long-term leadership of the finance group, he leaves the Air Products finance team well positioned for this transition. I would like to thank Paul for his outstanding service and dedication to Air Products.” 

McGlade continued, “Scott Crocco brings to the role a significant depth and breadth of understanding of Air Products from his extensive experience across all areas of the Finance organization, including his most recent role as corporate controller and chief accounting officer. The board of directors and I have every confidence in his abilities as he assumes this key role.” 

Paul Huck said, “Air Products is a great company, and I am proud to have spent my entire business career as a member of the team working to make it better. I would like to thank all of the people at Air Products for their efforts and the support they have given me. We have accomplished great things together, and the company is well positioned to continue to succeed in the future. I have worked with Scott for his entire career here, and I am certain he will make a great CFO.”
