                    Company Overview                  

For more than 30 years, our organization has been keeping healthcare close to home in cities and towns across the nation. Our affiliated hospitals deliver a wide range of health services and function as vitally important members of their local communities.
As one of the largest hospital organizations in the nation, our size provides an advantageous economy of scale and critical resources to help local hospitals identify and act on opportunities. As a result, these hospitals have made significant investments in healthcare services, physician recruitment, facility improvements, modern medical technology and, most importantly, an ever-strengthening commitment to clinical excellence.
A Record of Growth 
Today, our organization includes 137 affiliated hospitals in 21 states. Across these hospitals, about 123,000 employees and approximately 20,000 physicians on their medical staffs share a fundamental commitment to quality, compassionate care.
Acquisitions also have fueled our growth. Dozens of individual community hospitals and small healthcare systems have joined our organization over the past decade. The successful integration of these facilities, along with the large scale acquisitions of Triad Hospitals, Inc. in 2007 and Health Management Associates, Inc. in 2014, made us the largest publicly traded hospital company in the nation as measured by number of hospital facilities.
On April 29, 2016, the organization formed a new, independent, publicly traded hospital company by spinning off a group of 38 hospitals and Quorum Health Resources, LLC, a leading hospital management and consulting firm. That new company is Quorum Health Corporation, which is also headquartered in Middle Tennessee.
Community Health Systems, Inc. is headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee, and our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CYH.

                    Quality                  

People come to hospitals at their most vulnerable and hopeful times – for the birth of a baby, a health emergency, surgery, the end of life. Local hospitals affiliated with Community Health Systems appreciate the trust of their patients, striving to meet their needs for quality health services and their expectations for a satisfying experience. Thousands of frontline caregivers are focused on evidence-based medicine, processes and clinical care paths that improve outcomes and patient safety. Numerous awards and accreditations recognize this commitment and underscore how important quality is to our organization.
Top Performers in Key Quality Measures
The Joint Commission, a leading accrediting agency for healthcare organizations, has recognized 118 CHS-affiliated hospitals as Top Performers on Key Quality Measures.® Only about one-third of the nation’s eligible hospitals were recognized for exemplary performance in using clinical processes shown to improve care for conditions including heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, surgical care, children’s asthma, inpatient psychiatric services, stroke, venous thromboembolism, perinatal care, immunization, tobacco treatment and substance use. Of the 118 CHS-affiliated hospitals recognized this year, 101 have appeared on the list more than once. Of the 117 hospitals nationwide that have achieved the Top Performer recognition for five consecutive years, 26 are affiliated with Community Health Systems. Ratings are based on accountability measures reported to The Joint Commission during the 2014 calendar year. Click here to see a list of affiliated hospitals honored this year.
Patient Safety Organization
All CHS-affiliated hospitals are participants in an affiliated component Patient Safety Organization (PSO). PSOs were authorized under the Patient Safety Act of 2005 and are designed to improve the quality and safety of U.S. healthcare delivery. By providing both privilege and confidentiality, PSOs create a secure environment where clinicians and health systems can collect, aggregate and analyze data, thereby improving quality by identifying and reducing the risks and hazards associated with patient care. Currently there are only 79 listed PSOs in the United States.
Specialty Accreditations
Many CHS-affiliated hospitals have gained accreditation for specialized services, including:

Advanced Primary Stroke Center Accreditation (The Joint Commission)
Bariatric Center of Excellence (American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgeons)
Cancer Center Accreditation (American College of Cancer Surgeons Commission on Cancer)
Chest Pain Center Accreditation (Society of Chest Pain Centers)
Get with the Guidelines Performance Achievement (American Heart Association)
Joint Replacement (Hips and Knees) Accreditation (The Joint Commission)
Spine Surgery Certification (The Joint Commission)

			COMMUNITY HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.		
As published in The Community Foundation Spotlight in The Press Enterprise on May 24, 2014. Moreno Valley Community Health Center - 22675 Alessandro Blvd., Moreno Valley 92553 / 951.571-2350Serving under-insured and uninsured individuals such as the homeless, indigent, and working poor, Community Health Systems offers individuals the opportunity to receive the health care they need on a sliding-scale and in a supportive, comfortable environment. Established from the roots of Bloomington Community Health Center in Bloomington, Community Health Systems, Inc. (CHSI) has grown with community health centers in the counties of Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego. The mission of CHSI is not to compete with other clinics that provide healthcare services, but to serve the indigent population who other doctors cannot see because of financial constraints and to meet these patients’ healthcare needs. McGruff, the Crime Dog educating CHSI pediatric patients about staying safe through games, puzzles and coloring books.In 1991, Jack E. Johns, the chief executive officer of CHSI, a retired military man with a career in military medicine, realized he missed working directly with patients. Johns began working with Community Clinics and is now dedicated to the work of CHSI. To date there have been 85,000 patient visits, 35,000 of which were uninsured individuals, in all five CHSI clinics combined, three of which are in Riverside County.  Johns notes that the centers in Riverside County are all relatively new state-of-the-art facilities and their focus is more than just family medicine. “We have teen clinics in three of the sites for teens at risk. This is one of the biggest issues in our community right now,” says Johns. Working with young pregnant women who are as young as 12- and 13- years old, CHSI is able to offer all services and resources available.  University Community Health Center - 2933 University Ave., Riverside 92507 / 951.224-8220“By the time we are finished they have essentially a baby shower’s worth of products,” says Johns. “It’s astounding how many girls this age are pregnant.” It can be a terrifying time for the girls and the staff not only looks after their prenatal care, but also talks to the mother’s parents, helps the girls get back in school, and helps them with their social needs. They also receive dental care and are educated on what their babies need to thrive.  University Community Health Center giving away backpacks at Back to School Health Fair.Youth dentistry is also an important service to the community and the pediatric anesthesia program is an uncommon service. “We have children whose teeth are so bad, that they are malnourished,” says Johns. “They can’t explain to their parents that it’s their teeth. They think they have a headache or something is wrong with their face.” Using anesthesia, the children go to sleep in their parents arms and awaken with their dental care attended to and without the stress. “Sometimes, the next time we see these young patients, they’ve gained five pounds,” says Johns.  Children who aren’t in school may also have vision problems that adults don’t recognize. “We do try to push them over to the optometrist to get them seen,” says Johns. “We find out that the kids can’t see in front of them, let alone see the stars in the sky and when they suddenly can, it seems like a miracle to them.” Magnolia Community Health Center - 9380 Magnolia Ave., Riverside 92503 / 951.373-5620Finding funding to provide services is always a challenge. The Youth Grantmakers Fund through The Community Foundation has supported biweekly informational classes at the Magnolia Community Health Center, but CHSI is always on the lookout for further funding. “A community clinic that is really accomplishing its mission will always have a cash flow problem,” says Johns. “The very idea is that if we start making more money, we give more services. As soon as we start feeling more comfortable, we should be delivering more services.”  Moreno Valley Family Health Center Child Health & Disability Prevention Program (CHDP) delivers periodic health assessments and services to low income children and youth.Governed by a board of members made up by the community, Johns notes that CHSI is really about serving the community where they are based. “Having a local volunteer board helps us maintain the programs that are needed the most within the community,” says Johns. CHSI also hopes that more of the community will learn about the services available to them at their clinics as they feel they are often an unknown resource. Johns, the board, and the staff feel that the struggles of meeting community needs are worth the end results. “The days when I get discouraged and think it’s hopeless and we can’t do it, I sit in the waiting room and watch the patients and the kids in the waiting room,” says Johns. “Then I get re-energized and start all over again.” To find out more about Community Health Systems, Inc., their services and how to support them, you can visit www.chsica.org or call (951) 571-2300.
