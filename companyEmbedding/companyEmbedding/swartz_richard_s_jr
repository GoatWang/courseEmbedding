Mississippi Personal Injury Attorney
Personalized Legal Assistance for 30+ Years
Accidents typically happen when you least expect them. Even the most careful
	 of individuals cannot fully prepare for an unexpected accident, nor the
	 stressful consequences that follow. Car and truck collisions, birth injuries,
	 and other accidents often leave costly medical bills, lost wages, and
	 temporary or permanent disability in their wake, causing you undue stress
	 and making recovery that much more difficult.
At Richard Schwartz & Associates, P.A., our skilled personal injury
	 attorneys in Jackson, MS believe that you shouldn’t have to struggle
	 with these consequences all on your own. When an accident occurs due to
	 another person’s negligence, we can help you fight for the fair
	 financial reparation you are owed. We strive for the best possible outcome
	 for each unique case, offering open communication and one-on-one, personalized
	 assistance throughout the entire legal process.
Contact our firm today at (601) 869-0696 to set up your free case evaluation.

Fighting for Your Rights After an Accident
Even though insurance companies claim to protect you from the aftermath
	 of an accident, it’s always in their best interest to avoid paying
	 out your injury claim. Instead, insurance companies will often go to drastic
	 lengths to devalue or completely deny your claim—even if you were
	 not at fault. When this happens, it can leave you feeling overwhelmed
	 and unsure of your legal options. However, an experienced Jackson personal
	 injury attorney can help you fight back.
