Report: DHS Advisory Group to Produce Reports on Botnet Attack Mitigation

136 Views 


A group of advisers within the Department of Homeland Security‘s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee will release two reports on how the U.S. government can counter cyber attacks carried out by networks of compromised devices, know as botnets, Nextgov reported Friday.
Sonus Networks CEO Raymond Dolan, chairman of NSTAC’s Internet and Communications Resilience Subcommittee, said the first report will include ways to expand existing technologies to prevent hackers from adding personal computers and other devices into botnet groups.
Dolan added that the first report will also cover measures to fight botnet attacks and will be issued to DHS and Commerce Department leaders in October.
The subcommittee plans to produce an initial draft of the first report in August and has called on 20 subject matter experts to provide information on botnets, Dolan noted.
The group has yet to set a due date for the second report, which will explore methods to mitigate the formation and growth of botnet armies, according to Dolan.

Sonus Networks announced an initiative that will combine the capabilities of Sonus Session Border Controllers (SBCs) and industry leading next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) to provide a truly unified security perimeter for enterprises.

	The new solution addresses the growing need for enterprises to secure both IP-based data and SIP-based real-time communications in a cohesive, consistent manner as they migrate to Unified Communications (UC), said Sonus Networks.

	Under the current UC security perimeter arrangement, firewalls and SBCs work independently to address data and real-time communications traffic, respectively. This deployment creates natural holes in the enterprise security perimeter that can be exploited during an attack.

	In the new unified security perimeter, NGFWs and Sonus SBCs work together by exchanging security context to leverage their strengths and fill these security holes. Sonus SBCs deep understanding of SIP session characteristics can now enable NGFWs to take part in mitigating telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) attacks and theft of service attacks that might have been missed.

	Similarly, the NGFWs payload scanning ability can help the SBCs blacklist bad actors sending spyware or other malware. By linking the NGFW and SBC platforms at the control-plane level, the unified security perimeter provides a holistic network defense system that makes real-time threat detection and mitigation a reality in both hardware and cloud architectures. This capability becomes increasingly important as enterprises move to cloud or software-defined network (SDN) architectures, where the network perimeter may now be logical rather than physical.


Mykola Konrad, VP, Product Management and Marketing, Sonus
		By integrating the capabilities of next-generation firewalls with Sonus SBCs and leveraging the automation capabilities of SDN architectures, this new architecture delivers unprecedented security against data exfiltration, TDoS and many other UC threats.


Shawn Hakl, VP, Business Networking and Security Solutions, Verizon 
	The efforts by two of our VNF providers, Sonus Networks and Palo Alto Networks, to support cross VNF service chains is exactly the type of intelligent collaboration we had envisioned when we launched Verizon Virtual Network Services. The exchange of meta data between virtual functions to allow policy decisions based on complete visibility across the network will provide a level of security for enterprises that is simply not possible with individual point solutions.

Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



D Value | D Growth | C Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
