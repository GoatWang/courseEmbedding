Ad Agency plus more!.......Mel Brooks is that short, funny Jewish guy who is known to moviegoers as the man behind The Producers (1968), Blazing Saddles (1974) and Young Frankenstein (1974). Throughout the 1950s Brooks wrote comedy for TV star Sid Caesar (Your Show of Shows), and worked with Carl Reiner, his partner in the hugely successful comedy recording, "The 2,000 Year-Old Man" (1960). In the 1960s Brooks became a big star. He won an Oscar for a cartoon short, The Critic (1963), created the hit TV show Get Smart (1965-70) and wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for his directorial debut, The Producers (1968). Brooks has worked frequently with actor Gene Wilder, and together they made some of the most popular comedies of the 1970s, including Blazing Saddles (1974) and Young Frankenstein. In recent years Brooks has had enormous success with the play adaptation of The Producers, a Broadway smash since 2001. His other films include Silent Movie (1976), History of the World Part One (1981) and Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993)....Carl Reiner is the writer and producer who created the hit show The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961-66), in which he played Dick Van Dyke's tyrannical boss, Alan Brady. Before that Reiner had made a name for himself on the New York stage and in Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows (1950-54) and Caesar's Hour (1954-57), where he won two Emmy awards for his work as a comic actor. Reiner has had success in feature films also, directing comedies including Enter Laughing (1966-67, based on his autobiographical book and starring Alan Arkin), Oh, God (1977) and four movies with Steve Martin: The Jerk (1979), Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982), The Man With Two Brains (1983) and All of Me (1984). Reiner is also known for his long-running comedy routine with Mel Brooks, "The 2,000 Year-Old Man," (winner of a 1998 Grammy), and for his occasional appearances on television and in the movies, including the role of Saul Bloom, the elderly confidence man of Steve Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven movies (co-starring George Clooney and Don Cheadle). In 2004 he lent his voice to the CGI-animated TV series Family of the Pride.
