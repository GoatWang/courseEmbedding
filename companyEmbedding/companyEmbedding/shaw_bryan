Bio







Brian Shaw
Standing 6-foot-8 and weighing in at 425 LBS, Brian Shaw is easily the largest man on the Rogue athlete roster, and he’s also one of the most accomplished. Across a decade-long career in Strongman competitions, the Colorado native has shown remarkable consistency and all-out dominance, winning three “World’s Strongest Man” titles and a pair of Arnold Strongman Classics. He has finished in the Top 5 at both events each of the past six years, and still stands as the only American to win those titles as well as “America’s Strongest Man.”
Shaw showed no signs of slowing down in 2015, taking first place at both the Arnold and World’s Strongest Man—a feat he’d first performed in 2011. Shaw holds a degree from Black Hills State University and still trains out of his hometown of Fort Lupton, Colorado.
