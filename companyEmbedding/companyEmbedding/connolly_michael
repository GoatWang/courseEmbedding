On top of that, our computer system also will provide for you the best possible price to purchase those books, linking you to the best online retailer for your needs.

Thanks for all your hard work     added to favorites






John



Excellent site  …  but where is William Makepeace Thackeray?  I also don’t see Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings.






Brandon



They weren’t even on our to do list until you mentioned them. Happy to add them to it though. Thanks!








Amy



What a delightful (and useful!) surprise to find your site. Would you consider listing Amy Tan?






Brandon



Thank you so much! She’s actually at the top of my to do list here, and with your request, that puts her at the very top. She’ll be up in the next few days.








Robert



Please consider adding Greig Beck






Diane



Could you add Lauren Willig?






SUSAN



I SO TOTALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK YOU HAVE PUT INTO THIS SIGHT.  PLEASE THINK ABOUT ADDING THE FOLLOWING AUTHORS AS I DID NOT SEE THEM LISTED. THANK YOU AGAIN…     AUTHORS…
MARY KITTREDGE, ARTHUR HALEY, HARRY STEIN, EILEEN DREYER, LEONARD GOLDBERG & CHARLES WILSON






Jan



I like your site.  It’s great for chasing down SciFi books.  But I didn’t see Jasper Fforde who writes the Thursday books and others.






Brandon



Jasper was right on the brink of being added before your recommendation. Expect to see him added soon. Thanks!








Stephen



Hi could you please add Stephen Harding?  Thanks!






Brandon



While our focus is fiction, I’ve added him to my list.








Sue Morris



Please could you add Anne Bennett, I am so confused with her books as she has written 6 that link in together about the sullivan family, have read most of them but didn’t realise their significance till I had given them away, now collecting them again and would love to read them in order. This is a fantastic site and really useful, thanks for all your hard work!!






Brandon



I can add her to our to do list, but until then, I think I can help out with a more immediate solution. (And thanks for the kind words!)
http://www.annebennett.co.uk/#/books/4533825832






Sue Morris



Thank you for this link, do you have any idea why there are 2 books with the same title but different pictures on the front included in the 6 books? Could it be that there are in fact only 5 books in the Sullivan series?






Brandon



I apologize for the delay in the response. It would be an alternate cover of some sort.






L Free



Also, the “Good Reads” site shows publication dates: http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/368018.Anne_Bennett












Stacon



Toby Neal’s “Lei Crime” series






mel k



Why no listing for Colin Cotterill?






Brandon



There’s no reason why we don’t have any author on the site other than not enough people want them up yet (and we can only put them up so fast). However, Colin is almost at the very top of our list of authors to add, so he should be up very soon!








carol



I don’t find Anna Quindlen. Am I missing it or can it be added?  I , too recently found this site and it is indeed excellent and fills a real need for the many book lovers that want to read titles in order.  Thanks,  Carol






Trevor Cole



Jim Kelly please.






Cheryl Chapman



I love this site!  Creating a lending library for my sorority.  Could you please add Karen Harper to the list?  We love romantic/suspense.  Thank You!!!!






Diana



I’m a fan of Sharyn McCrumb, particularly the Ballad series and the Elizabeth MacPherson novels. Hope to see her here soon. Thanks.






Brandon



She’s not far down our “to do” list and she just got closer to the top!








Rah



Looking for Ally Condie






Chic



Looking for Robert Harris (Enigma; Fatherland)






Brandon



Thanks for the request!








Sheila J Smith



David Handler






Cheryl



Great website!  Use it just about every day!  Please add Catherine Anderson when you get a chance.  Thanks!






pilford



I would like more info on Zoe Sharpe A Nottingham UK writer






Jim



James carlos  Blake ?






Susan



I’ve just discovered this terrific site, and wish I’d discovered it a lot sooner.  Thank you!






J



I’d like to see “Blood Coven” Novels by Marianne Mancusi






Brandon



Thanks! She’s just moved closer to the top on our “to do” list.








Tebs



Just stumbled onto this site and made my day. I love Evelyn Anthony and noticed she is not listed. Thanks!






Brandon



Thanks for the request!








Mandy S



I would love to see Barbara Hambly’s books added to this page.  Awesome site!






danbrownx



Why is THE MYSTERIOUS AVIATOR not listed with other Neville Schute books?






Brandon



Because it’s listed under its other title of “So Disdained.” There’s a note at the bottom.








danbrownx



I appreciate your work and your list but I think both titles should be shown to avoid confusion.  I have The Mysterious Aviator and no where does it mention a second title.  I have just read Wikipedia and I see the American version is TMA; the English version So Disdained.






Pebbles



Can you add Anne Tyler and Kazuo Ishiguro please. Love this site. I use it all the time.






audrey1984



suggesting michael ridpath, who writes thrillers






audrey1984



I notice you’re in high demand and a bit backed up, whereas I am an unemployed librarian who loves your site and would treasure some online work. Just sayin’ ….






Brandon



Unfortunately, we’re not currently hiring, but please send your contact info to us at g@dealerdan.com incase that changes.








Jay



Can’t believe Jacquelyn Mitchard is not included on your site






Brandon



There’s a lot of authors that I can’t believe are not on this site yet! But I usually add authors based on what the visitors want to see, so Ms. Mitchard is now one step closer to being added. 🙂








Jay



Thank you Brandon. My first ever posting on your site was a bit curt and I apologize for that.






Bev Harrison



Would you consider putting the following authors up on your site?
Ella Price, Felicity Heaton, Lisa Renee Jones, Jasmine Haynes, Azure Boone, JM Madden, JS Luxor, Amy Cross and Rita Hestand.
More to come.






Brandon



Thanks! Send as many requests as you like. They all count.








Dave



Another author add request:  Jane K. Cleland and her series of Josie Prescott antiquarian mysteries.  Thanks.






Karen



May I suggest that, instead of page numbers, you list the pages as Ray-Robert M, Robert R.-Simon, etc. Looking for an author whose first name comes in the middle of the alphabet is a guessing game to find the correct page. Thanks.






Brandon



This is an excellent suggestion. If there is a way to do this without having to do it manually, we’d strongly consider it.








Bev Harrison



Okey doke, here are some more you might consider for your list:
Tonya KAPPES
Terri REID
Regan BLACK
Irina SHAPIRO
Cynthia SAX
Thanks






Trish



Fabulous site – just found you and am so happy!!  Thank you very much for your hard work!  I have a great author for you to add – Clinton Mckinzie.  His main character is Special Agent Antonio Burns and he is a rock climber and a bit of a rebel.  Have read them all – suspense, action and legal thrills – great reads!






Paul M.



Would like to see Grant McKenzie on the list.  Thanks, Paul.






Cheryl



Hi, Brandon!  Please add Joan Johnston when you get a chance.   Thanks!  Love this site bunches …  I can’t seem to do without it on a daily basis.






katelowe



I would like to see Joanna Campbell-Slan added to list






Princess Poopyhead



Unfortunately, you have none of the authors or series listed on your website I’m currently interested in. Boo-hoo!






Brandon



Tell us what you want to see added!






Princess Poopyhead



Richard Stevenson, John Morgan Wilson, Joseph Hansen, Mark Richard Zubro










TheAntiObama



A very Scary Author Malachi Martin, Exorcist for the Vatican, unfortunately is not list. Will just keep an eye on Orson S. Card, Dan Simmons, and Jeff Sharra for new releases.






Brandon



Thank you for the request!








Peggy Hilmer Gibson



Looking for books by Chris Knopf with main character Sam Acquillo please






Brandon



He just happened to be at the very top of our list, so he’ll be added very shortly.








mel



Was looking for a list of Jeremiah Healy books.  Especially with his obituary in today’s newspaper.






Magato6



Just came across this site …..my!  Am thrilled to see all my favorite authors and new authors to read, wish I had this years ago!  It is sometimes hard to remember  who wrote which character ?   Just  great to get on here and surf for hours!   I am a voracious reader, 7 books a week!  Sometimes, So always looking for new (to me) authors to read!  My favorite is Alex Cross. Michael Bennett Series! I don’t normally read books with co-authors with the exception of Lee Child and  Douglas Preston,  so I am glad I tried Michael Bennett series… Otherwise James Patterson is my favorite when he writes alone!
MC Beaton’s Hamish  Mc Beth
Diana Gabaldan ( only historical books I have read )
Jan Karon
Andrew Greely
Both Kellerman’s
Ian Rankin
Robert Parker
Could go on for hours!
Like all kinds of books except Western, Sci Fi and Histerical Romances!  If a book makes me laugh? So much better!
My favorite is Mystery Novels , but I like series where characters come alive !  Learn new things  about new places, places I will never. Visit  but can visualize through books ! 






Bob Buchanan



Would like Sean Black to your list.  Most of his novels are 4 star






Eamon



Love the site! Opened up a whole new world. Thank you very much






DANNA COGBURN



Love this. wish  could have found it sooner






Patsy Laurendine Ferrara



Very helpful site!  Gillian Roberts’ Amanda Pepper series isn’t represented, though.  You may want to consider adding.  Thanks!






Brandon



I didn’t see this post until now, but Gillian is now up and Amanda will soon follow.








Cynthia



Is there a way to search out authors who write action suspense on your site?






Brandon



Besides writing it in a search box, not really, unfortunately. I’m not sure I’ve ever used that term for a genre, but you can look up an author in that genre and maybe there will be others listed with it under “If you like…”. Adding a genre section to the site is one of my goals, but to properly index them would take a long time.








Eamon



Craig Russell should be in there, gentlemen






Carole



Would like the “Midwife” books by Sam Thomas listed.  His third one is coming out in January.






disqus_v3VchbOZZx



KATHRYN LE VEQUE. I’d love to see her books listed here. She has written so many Historical Medieval romantic adventures.






Max



Ivan Doig writes superb novels, but is not in your authors list.






Bill_R



Very helpful site… perhaps you could include Carol Davis Luce in your authors list.






Gail Heath



Where are the Charlie Steel books?






Brandon



If enough people are looking for him, I will add him to the site!








Bev



What about adding Red Phoenix as an author?






Brandon



Thanks for the request!








Judith Dillon



I use your site constantly. Would you please add Qiu Xiaolong’s Inspector Chen series and his other works?






Brandon



I shot him right up there for you. Thanks for the request!








Andy



Thank you! I try to finish at least one book a day, and absolutely love series, where my favorites will keep appearing. Wonderful site, and will follow and access via Facebook.






Evelyn Kostanski



How often does ORDER OF BOOKS update authors booklists?
Thank you!






Elizabeth M Woods



No Todd McCaffrey?






Candice



I would like Robinson Wells on the site. Thanks! Your site is very helpful.






Nadine



I love this site! I have found it most helpful over the past year. I was wondering why I could not find any listing of Pulitzer Prize Winner Alice Munro?






Brandon



Thanks for the comments, Nadine! Alice was one tier down from being added to the site, so you can take credit for getting her added very soon!








Mary



Just discovered this marvelous site. Thank you. Thank you






plainoldwill



This is a wonderful site.  Where is Robert Silverberg?






A J



You are missing Mary Coneally; fab christian romance writer, women have a can do attitude, men are dimensional, good, bad, real. Turn of the century, old West.






Bev



What about JS Scott? She has quite a few books.






joe bondaloon



looking for William Lashner, a terrific author






Brandon



He’s listed! http://www.orderofbooks.com/authors/william-lashner/






joe bondaloon



found him, thanks










Ila Turner



Please add https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/167605.Guillermo_del_Toro  He is probably best known for his movie directing now but is a very good novelists, best known for the Strain Trilogy. I looked under G and T, and under Strain Trilogy with no luck.  Thanks for considering my request






Brandon



Moved him up our “to do” list thanks to your request. Sorry for the delay in response!








Bev



Could you please add Cassie Laurent?






Brandon



Added her to our “to do” list! Thanks! (And sorry for the delay in response.)








kathi Harris



What a useful site and tool.  Now on my favorites list.






Jeffrey J Parker



Is there a reason that author John Wayne Falbey’s series Sleeping Dogs and Endangered Species are not listed? I just discovered them and at first found it difficult to figure out the sequencing of the various series due to similar titles. Thus I came to OOB for guidance only to find out they are not listed. That was disappointing! Otherwise, I love this site although it has made me a bit lazy!






Brandon



The only reason would be not enough people have requested him, as you just have. Thanks!








Nancy



I’d like to see Kristina Ludwig’s series of Amish fiction novels.  I think the first one is Amish Baby.  I’d like to see her novels on this site.  Thank you!






Brandon



Thanks, Nancy!








Mark



Great site.  I go to it often.  Can you list Jess Walter?  Thanks






Brandon



Thanks for the suggestion!








A. Dogster member



I can’t believe I’m the first to say this, and I’m sorry to feel the need, because I really do appreciate all you’ve done on this site. For those who love serial books this is awesome. But when your listing authors or books alphabetically, it would make a whole lot of sense to give us A – Z links to jump nearer to what we are searching for, than simply giving us a numerical page list and making us guess as to how far in our author or book might be, thereby having to wade through pages and pages of stuff to get there.  Like the example below.






Brandon



Sorry to say, but you’re not the first person to say that. 🙂
We’d love to add a system like this in the future.






A. Dogster member



Looking forward to that day. It’s really isn’t difficult to do, just requires a bit of time, some shifting, and renaming of pages.










A. Dogster member



Now that said, I can’t find Sax Rohmer, (real name, Henry Ward) a prolific English novelist. He is best remembered for his series of novels featuring the master criminal Dr. Fu Manchu, but he wrote others too. I’ve looked under both Sax, Henry, and Dr. If I’ve overlooked it somehow, would you please steer me to it?






Brandon



We’d love to have every author ever available on this site, but unfortunately we can only do one at a time (if we’re expected to have any sort of quality whatsoever). Your request has been acknowledged and Sax has been moved closer to the top of our “to do” list!






A. Dogster member



Thank you, Brandon.










robeb4



Love your site. Please add author John Mortimer and his Horace Rumpole books. Thanks.






Bluesilver82



Just discovered this site. Great resource for staying up to date on my favorite book series. Just finished an excellent book that came out early last year: The Devon Proposition by D.R. Braddy. I recommend it to anyone who’s into action/adventure.






Jake Hagan



There are a bunch of excellent authors here.  I’m surprised that Fredrick Manfred, Vardis Fisher, Harvey Ferguson, and John Neihardt aren’t included.  They were great Western writers.






Bev



What about Cassie Laurent? She has quite a few books and the different series can be quite confusing. Thanks.






Gigi



No Amanda Ashley?






KG



Kent Haruf is missing. 






Michelle



I have just found this site and like others, wish I’d found it sooner. I love it and bookmarked as one of my favourites! I am always on the look out for new Authors to read I’d love to see an option for Authors to be listed in genre’s, rather than having to click on each one to see what they write?






Lisa Oaks Bragg



Author Marne Davis Kellogg, would love to see her books here.






LM



How about Emma Jameson-I couldn’t find any of her books listed here.






Ila Turner



Please add Helen Hanson, thriller writer to your list when you can. Author of 4 books and 1 more on the way, she is very good. http://www.amazon.com/Helen-Hanson/e/B004FD2MR2/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1  Thanks.






cyberpal



James Hadley Chase is missing! 






Stuart Aken



You’re doing a fine job. Keep up the good work!






Michael James Gallagher



How do I add my books here, please?






Doris Koester



Looking for Peter Straub Books






Mitch Thomas



Can you please Author Hope Callaghan to your list?  She writes women sleuths cozy mysteries.  Her info
http://www.hopecallaghan.com
Thank you!






Rob



I am a fan of Tony Park and hope to see him here soon. 






chrijeff



Thank you for listing the Making of America by Lee Davis Willoughby!  It’s so long I despaired of ever finding a complete listing of it.  You should add more of the “produced by Lyle Kenyon Engel” series–they all tend to be lengthy.  Also J. T. Edson (if you need help on that, I have one), not great literature, but quite popular and still collected by Western lovers; Mazo de la Roche’s Jalna (old but fondly remembered by many); Janice Holt Giles (Cooper-Fowler Family and others).
Is it possible to search by name of series?  Some users might not be able to remember the name of an author.






jan



I just found about the Canadian “Hercule Poirot” character Emile Cinq-Mars. The books are written by John Farrow. I’d like to see this series added to the list.






Mongoose218



Please add Michelle Diener to your list!   She has a short series about a real man and woman from the era of Elizabeth I;  and some set in Regency England……they are good, and I highly recommend them!
  I use “order of books” very frequently to try to read books in the order in which they author published them and in which they were meant to be read!  Great site!






Carolinajule



Please add Tracy L. Higley to your list.  Thanks.






D.E. Walker



e.e. Doc Smith ? Lensmen series






Letitgo



Great site.  I also use KDL.org for their “What’s Next” link.






Beth



Please add C. L. Bevill.






Judy



No, Jack Higgins?

Still not been able to find author Gunther Lutz included in your authors list. James Hadley Chase is now available thank you.






Brandon



We’ll do our best to get him up soon.










Meta Chalker



I just discovered Thor Heyerdahl and his book Kon-Tiki: across the Pacific by raft.
I know he has written a number of books, but I do not see his name listed on this website.
I was very happy to see all of Robert Parker’s books and have read most of them. Did not care very much for the ghost writers which his wife and family had employed to continue the series.
There are still many of his books I have not read yet, so I will stick with him.
Thank you for setting up this website. It is very useful and user friendly.






Clara



Just found and bookmarked this site. Spending a little time everyday searching for favorite authors especially the ones with hard to find books.






Joanne



Have been enjoying the Poldark series by Winston Graham and would love to see his books listed in Order Of Books. There has been an increase of interest in his books since the Poldark series was recently on TV.






Melanie Rickmar



Could You add Dorothy Eden, Charlene Weir and M.D. Lake to your To-Do List?  Thanks!






Rhea Parsons



Please add Denise Grover Swank. She has several series (about 6) and is a great author!






Graeme



On our list – will get Denise up soon 🙂  Thanks for the suggestions








Kay McCloud



Just read a Wishcraft Mystery by Heather Blake-pretty good! Could you please add her to your author list? I would like to be able to access these on Order of Books. Thanks, Kay






Graeme



Thanks for the suggestion Kay.  We’ve got the list of her books all written up and added to our database.  Just have to write up the bio and get it posted hopefully within a week.








Chris Radford



We just found this site! thankyou! it’s great. We are readers of Juliet Mariller books but could not find her listed here. Does she have another name perhaps?






Graeme



Thanks for the suggestion Chris – we’ve added it to her list and will have her up soon.








D.E. Walker



Nicholas Guild please.






D.E. Walker



Author Robert Marcello please. For example, Check out ” The Einstein Prophecy”. It’s got late WWII, Egyptian tombs, hidden forces of good and evil, secret Einstein stuff. What’s not to like!






Esther



can you add Julie Carobini?






Carolyn Scardino



am now reading jane thynne and just found out there are more than the secret of scents…..






Liz



Does anyone know this book and/or author:  A man goes to see his father who has cancer.  His father asks him to go to Mexicali to find a prostitute.  It is a mystery/thriller book.  My husband wants to read it and lost the link.






Glen Wittur



William Deverell, Canada’s top crime writer and onr of most honored






Steve Rodriguez



Excuse me. Thank you for your wonderful site. When you are able to get to it, could you please include Mark Hodder? Thank you so much.






Phil H Morrell



I love this site. It’s absolutely the best resource for finding a newly discovered author’s complete catalogue. However, no William Golding, “Lord of the Flies” (for which he won a Nobel Prize) and “Rite of Passage”.






Keith L



How about James Carol author of the Jefferson Winter series?






Becky



Could you please add the book list for Dianne Duvall and Caris Roane? It would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!






MJ



I use this site often to determine which book comes next in a series that I am enjoying.  I cannot find Elizabeth Hunter who writes several romantic fantasy series including the Irin Chronicles, the Elemental Mysteries, and Elemental World series.  I hope to see Elizabeth Hunter included soon.






Ila Turner



Hi Please add Peter Clines to your list – I’ll get together his list of books and send it to you if you need me to but in the meantime here is this: https://www.fantasticfiction.com/c/peter-clines/
with a bibliography and a bio.  I own all of them and this list is current as of today Aug 02, 2016.  Great author in many areas, in my opinion.






Patti Leota Genack



I’ve looked for Mary Anna Evans before and  you still don’t have her Archaeology inspired mysteries listed. Hope you have her listed her soon.






nik morton



A great site! There are two series by me (Nik Morton) published by Crooked Cat (UK) not listed. Tana Standish psychic spy (#1The Prague Papers, #2 The Tehran Text) and Catherine Vibrissae, the ‘avenging Cat’ (#1 Catalyst, #2 Catacomb, #3 Cataclysm).






Jenny



I love this site and use it frequently.  How about adding Deborah Coonts, and her Lucky series?






Kathy Minick



Holly Chamberlin has written many enjoyable books.  Just finished Seashell Season.






Keith



Do you have a list of A.M. Delamonica’s books on your site?






Graeme



Yep http://www.orderofbooks.com/authors/am-dellamonica/








FreeMan



Organizing author names into 43 random groups identified numerically is incredibly obtuse (they’re not even broken out alphabetically? That’s weird), and the search engine returns sadly disorganized results that rarely help me find what I’m after.






Janis Weltzin



I’d love to see Jack McDevitt’s books – a favorite scifi author!






Robert Deckert



Please add Alma Alexander to your list. She has published more than a score of fantasy novels, including two YA series, and an adult fantasy, The Secrets of Jin-shei, now out in 13 languages.






Jeanne Manton



what happened to paullina simons listing?






Brandon



Was she on the site at some point, or are you asking about a request?






Jeanne Manton



She is so prolific please add her to your list. In order to sort through the Bronze Horseman series an order would be helpful. I so admire her writing that I would appreciate help  in watching her style develop.  Thanks










Sally Schroeder



Thank you!!!






Cathy



Just found this page, thanks!  I’ve used http://www.stopyourekillingme.com/ for years, but it only works for the mystery series. I used https://www.fantasticfiction.com/ for non mysteries, but wasn’t entirely happy with it. I think this site will be perfect!
