Company


Longfellow Investment Management Co. (LIM) was founded in 1986 with a focus on building portfolios that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns.  When we opened our doors, the 10-year Treasury yielded 8.05%, a 30-year mortgage averaged 10.15% and the S & P 500 closed at 247. While market conditions have changed dramatically since then, LIM has prospered, and remains an agile firm in the fixed income and arbitrage arenas. We navigated rising and falling interest rates, inflation and deflation, government shutdowns, bulls, bears, bubbles and periods of “irrational exuberance.” 

Over the years we have had the pleasure of working side-by-side with wonderful clients.  At the start, we offered Short Duration fixed income and Merger Arbitrage strategies. Based on client requests, we developed Core, Intermediate Duration, High Yield, Enhanced Cash, TIPS and Government-Only approaches. In many ways, our expansion and growth has been attributable to our clients’ evolving needs.  We are now proud to offer solutions for investors seeking a range of liquidity, income and capital preservation needs as well as specific objectives such as LDI, SRI, ESG and maximization of after-tax returns.  Thanks to the support of our clients, assets under management continue to grow, supporting the addition of great employees to our ranks.
Through all the changes, we remain true to our roots.  We still believe in focusing not just on returns, but rather consistent, risk-adjusted performance.  In the long run, investors are best rewarded for avoiding the underperformers rather than chasing a few outperformers.  More than anything else, we never lose sight of the fact that the assets we have been entrusted with are our clients’ assets, used to further their organizations’ missions.
	As you peruse the website remember that while there is plenty of information available here, additional resources are only a phone call away.  We seek to partner with clients and consultants to become a resource.  If you are looking for information on the markets, strategies or particular research, we encourage you to contact us directly.

InsightsThe Smaller Size Advantage in Fixed Income Cheap sectors and individual securities exist in the fixed income market because of non-economic factors, such as investor preferences, supply/demand imbalances and size constraints.  These structural factors create pockets of inefficiencies, which can be exploited by smaller, more nimble investment managers.  The following paper provides a sampling of several strategies and processes Longfellow Investment Management Co. (LIM) follows to capitalize on these opportunities and add value for our clients.

Company


Longfellow Investment Management Co. (LIM) was founded in 1986 with a focus on building portfolios that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns.  When we opened our doors, the 10-year Treasury yielded 8.05%, a 30-year mortgage averaged 10.15% and the S & P 500 closed at 247. While market conditions have changed dramatically since then, LIM has prospered, and remains an agile firm in the fixed income and arbitrage arenas. We navigated rising and falling interest rates, inflation and deflation, government shutdowns, bulls, bears, bubbles and periods of “irrational exuberance.” 

Over the years we have had the pleasure of working side-by-side with wonderful clients.  At the start, we offered Short Duration fixed income and Merger Arbitrage strategies. Based on client requests, we developed Core, Intermediate Duration, High Yield, Enhanced Cash, TIPS and Government-Only approaches. In many ways, our expansion and growth has been attributable to our clients’ evolving needs.  We are now proud to offer solutions for investors seeking a range of liquidity, income and capital preservation needs as well as specific objectives such as LDI, SRI, ESG and maximization of after-tax returns.  Thanks to the support of our clients, assets under management continue to grow, supporting the addition of great employees to our ranks.
Through all the changes, we remain true to our roots.  We still believe in focusing not just on returns, but rather consistent, risk-adjusted performance.  In the long run, investors are best rewarded for avoiding the underperformers rather than chasing a few outperformers.  More than anything else, we never lose sight of the fact that the assets we have been entrusted with are our clients’ assets, used to further their organizations’ missions.
	As you peruse the website remember that while there is plenty of information available here, additional resources are only a phone call away.  We seek to partner with clients and consultants to become a resource.  If you are looking for information on the markets, strategies or particular research, we encourage you to contact us directly.

 Career History



Director, Portfolio Manager

                                    2010 - Current                


Longfellow Investment Management Co. LLC


                  Longfellow Investment Management invests client portfolios in one of several in one of several fixed income-only mandates or in their merger arbitrage strategy. The firm's investment process, research and portfolio management are identical across all of their fixed income strategies; however, every portfolio is individually managed to meet each client’s specific guidelines and objectives. Longfellow's philosophy is based on the premise that upside is limited in fixed income investments. Downside risk,however, is substantial, so fixed income management should focus on analyzing risk. They believe that the fixed income portion of a portfolio should earn incremental returns over Treasuries without a substantial increase in risk.  Longfellow performs bottom-up fundamental-based research to determine the most attractive sectors and individual credits (securities/issuers). They use fundamental, technical and valuation analysis in determining specific security selection, ultimately purchasing the security with the best risk-adjusted return potential given the particular liquidity needs and portfolio objectives. Because Longfellow’s portfolio strategies (enhanced cash/short/intermediate/core) are similar in structure, once identified as attractive, most issuers are held across all portfolios/products, varying only by the specific issue’s maturity. As appropriate to each client, Longfellow incorporates the following sectors/securities into portfolios: Corporate Notes; Government Agency and Sovereign Issues; Commercial Mortgage-backed Securities (CMBS); Residential Mortgage-backed Securities (MBS); Asset-backed Securities (ABS); and Treasury Notes and Bonds (including zero-coupons and TIPS).
