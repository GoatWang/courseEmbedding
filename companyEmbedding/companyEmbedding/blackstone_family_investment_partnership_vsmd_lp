	Counterclaim, together with a Cross-Motion for Preliminary Injunction seeking
	to enjoin Product Carriers and Product Manager from holding themselves out as
	Managing Member and Vessel Manager for Products Investor, and from interfering
	with any foreclosure on Products Investors assets;




	                    WHEREAS,
	pending a hearing on Product Carriers and Product Managers motion for the
	preliminary injunction, Product Carriers, Product Manager and the

	seq

	., as amended
	(the 

	Bankruptcy Code

	), on April 29, 2009 (the 

	Petition Date

	)

	U.S. Shipping Partners, L.P., et al. v. Blackstone
	Corporate Debt Administration L.L.C. et al.

	, No. 09-1170 (RDD) (the
	

	Adversary Proceeding

	), and removed the State Court Action to United
	States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which was
	subsequently referred to the Bankruptcy Court (No. 09-1175 (RDD));




	                    WHEREAS,
	by Motion dated April 29, 2009, the Debtors sought (a) entry of an order
	enforcing the automatic stay of section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code against the

	inter alia

	,

	a temporary restraining order pending a hearing on the preliminary injunction
	request;




	                    WHEREAS,
	mutually desiring to avoid the burdens, risks and expenses of potential
	litigation between themselves, the Parties have entered into this Agreement to
	facilitate a full and final resolution and settlement of the Adversary
	Proceeding and the State Court Action, and to fully and finally resolve and
	settle any and all disputes between themselves;




	                    WHEREAS,
	the Debtors have considered the benefit to the Debtors estates and creditors
	that will be received as a result of the settlement of the Adversary Proceeding
	and the State Court Action, particularly in light of the costs, uncertainties
	and risks of further litigation, and have concluded that the settlement
	contained herein is (i) fair and equitable, (ii) a reasonable resolution of the
	Adversary Proceeding and the State Court Action, and (iii) in the best
	interests of the Debtors, their estates, their creditors, and all other
	parties-in-interest;




	                    WHEREAS,
	the Parties desire to set forth detailed terms for the settlement that was set
	forth on the Bankruptcy Court record by the Parties on June 3, 2009,




	38









	                     NOW,
	THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the covenants and releases
	herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is
	hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:




	                    1.     

	Bankruptcy
	Court Approval/Effective Date

	. (a) This Agreement is subject to approval by
	the Bankruptcy Court under Rule 9019 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy
	Procedure (

	Rule 9019

	) and Sections 363(b) and (f) of the Bankruptcy
	Code. If the Effective Date (as defined below) does not occur and this
	Agreement is terminated, neither this Agreement, its terms, any affidavits
	filed in support of this Agreement, correspondence regarding it, nor any
	negotiations in connection with this Agreement shall be, or be construed as or
	deemed to be, evidence of or an admission by or against any Party or admissible
	in any judicial, administrative or other proceeding, and this Agreement shall
	be null, void and of no further force or effect

	ab initio

	, and the Parties shall retain all of their rights,
	claims and defenses vis-à-vis one another, including, without limitation, the
	claims and defenses asserted or assertable in the Adversary Proceeding and/or
	the State Court Action.




	39









	                    (b)     The
	effective date of the Agreement (the 

	Effective Date

	) shall occur on
	the date that all of the following conditions precedent are satisfied or, in
	the case of the condition in paragraph 1(b)(iv), satisfied or waived: (i) this
	Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by all Parties hereto; (ii)
	the Bankruptcy Court shall have entered on the docket an order (the 

	Approval
	Order

	) approving the settlement in form and substance reasonably
	satisfactory to the Parties (including, without limitation, findings by the
	Bankruptcy Court that the Parties had entered into this Agreement in good faith
	and are entitled to the protections of Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code);
	(iii) no stay of the Approval Order prohibiting the consummation of the
	transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in effect; and (iv) either no
	appeal of the Approval Order shall have been filed or be pending on the 11th
	day following the date of entry thereof or, if there has been an appeal of the
	Approval Order, all appellate remedies have been fully exhausted and the
	Approval Order has been affirmed. If all the conditions to the Effective Date
	have been satisfied other than the condition in paragraph 1(b)(iv), the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties shall have the right to waive, in their sole discretion,
	satisfaction of such condition. In the event the Effective Date does not occur
	or cannot occur because one of the conditions precedent cannot be satisfied,
	and such conditions are not waived by the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties, the
	terms set forth herein shall be null and void and of no binding effect on any
	of the Parties. Each of the Parties hereto shall use their commercially
	reasonable efforts to cause the Effective Date to occur as promptly as possible
	after the date hereof, which for the avoidance of doubt shall not in any way
	impair the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties right, in their sole discretion, to not
	waive any unsatisfied condition precedent hereunder.




	                    (c)     Debtors
	shall file a motion seeking approval under Rule 9019 and Sections 363(b) and
	(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties, within 5 business days of the execution of this
	Agreement. The Parties hereto shall use reasonable efforts to cause the entry of
	the Approval Order approving and incorporating this Agreement. Reasonable
	efforts shall include the presentation of necessary evidence (documentary and
	testimony) to support entry of the Approval Order.




	40









	                    2.     

	Transfer
	of Product Carriers Class B Interest

	. (a) As of the Effective Date,
	Product Carriers shall irrevocably transfer, for consideration of $1, all of
	its right, title and interest as the Class B Member under the LLC Agreement,
	and all such right, title and interest, and all obligations, of the Class B
	Member under the LLC Agreement shall be automatically and irrevocably deemed
	transferred, free and clear of all Liens (as
	defined below) other than the NASSCO Lien (as defined below), to the
	Class A Members ratably according to each such Class A Members interest
	(obtained by dividing such Class A Members Capital Account (as defined in the

	Members). Products Carriers agrees that it shall file, and cause to be filed,
	all tax returns, reports and any other tax-related documents in a manner
	consistent with the transfer of the Class B Member Interest for $1. Product
	Carriers represents and warrants to the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties on the date
	hereof and immediately prior to the transfer on the Effective Date that,
	Product Carriers (i) is the record and beneficial owner of the Class B Member
	Interest (as defined in the LLC Agreement), and (ii) has good and valid title
	to the Class B Member Interest, free and clear of any lien, mortgage, pledge,
	claim, encumbrance, charge or other security interest (a 

	Lien

	), other
	than any Lien (I) on payments and other distributions made in connection with
	the Class B Member Interest arising as a result of the Collateral Assignment
	entered into between Product Carriers and NASSCO on August 7, 2006, to secure
	obligations owed under Article 36 of the Construction Contract (the 

	NASSCO Lien

	) and (II) on the
	Class B Member Interest, and any payments and distributions made in respect
	thereof, arising as a result of the Bankruptcy Courts Stipulation and Second
	Interim Order Regarding Use of Cash Collateral and Adequate Protection, dated
	May 27, 2009, and any subsequent interim or final order that supercedes such
	Second Interim Order.




	                    (b)     The
	Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that effective as of the Effective Date
	(i) Product Carriers will not be and no longer has the right to be the Managing
	Member of Products Investor, and (ii) Product Carriers no longer has, nor has
	any right to appoint, any persons acting as directors and representatives of
	the Class B Member on the Board of Directors of Products Investor. Product
	Carriers shall, as of the Effective Date, deliver to the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties
	the Certificate of Interest (as defined in the LLC Agreement) with respect to
	the Class B Member Interest endorsed in blank or accompanied by duly executed
	assignment documents.




	41









	                    (c)     It
	is further understood and agreed that, except as expressly set forth in this
	Agreement, (i) Product Carriers shall have as of the Effective Date
	relinquished all rights under the LLC Agreement with respect to Products
	Investor and (ii) the Debtors shall have as of the Effective Date relinquished
	all rights in respect of Products Investor and the Joint Venture, including all
	Vessels owned by or being constructed on behalf of the Joint Venture.




	                    (d)     At
	the Effective Date, there shall be a closing of the books of Products Investor,
	and each item of income, gain, loss and deduction of Products Investor for the
	period from January 1, 2009 through but excluding the Effective Date shall be
	allocated among the Class A Members and the Class B Member in accordance with
	the LLC Agreement as in effect on the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt,
	no item of income, gain, loss or deduction arising from and after the Effective
	Date shall be allocated to Product Carriers.




	                    (e)     The
	Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that as of the Effective Date the
	Performance Guaranty, dated as of August 7, 2006, made by U.S. Shipping
	Partners L.P. and USS PC Holding Corp. to Products Investor, shall be
	terminated and of no further force and effect.




	42









	                    3.     

	Termination
	of Management Agreement

	. (a) Debtors hereby acknowledge, confirm, and agree
	that as of the Effective Date Product Manager shall be terminated as Vessel
	Manager with respect to all Vessels,

	provided

	,

	however

	, that
	Product Manager shall remain as Vessel Manager and continue to provide
	Management and Operating Services (as defined in the Management Agreement) with
	respect to all Vessels, except as provided in this Agreement (but for the
	avoidance of doubt, as of the Effective Date Product Manager shall not provide
	Construction Supervision Services (as defined in the Management Agreement)
	except to the extent requested by Products Investor in accordance with
	paragraph 4(c)(i) hereof), until the earlier of (i) seventy-five days following
	the Effective Date, provided that Product Manager has complied in all material
	respects with its obligations in Section 3(b) below to cooperate with and
	assist in the transition of vessel management duties, and (ii) such time
	following the Effective Date as Products Investor and/or Blackstone/Cerberus
	Parties appoint a replacement Vessel manager (the 

	Replacement Vessel
	Manager

	) in their sole discretion, the Replacement Vessel Manager assumes
	full operational and management control of the

	Golden
	State

	, the

	Pelican State

	and
	any other Vessel Delivered (as defined in the Construction Contract) prior to
	the Effective Date (collectively the 

	Operating Vessels

	), and Debtors
	receive notification from Products Investor that full operational and
	management control of the Operating Vessels has been assumed by such
	Replacement Vessel Manager (which the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties estimate will
	be completed within approximately 60 days from the Effective Date), such notice
	to be given no later than one business day after the date all persons employed
	by Debtors or USS Transport LLC have vacated the

	Golden State

	and the

	Pelican
	State

	at the request of the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties (the period between the Effective Date
	and the earlier of the foregoing dates being the 

	Management Transition
	Period

	). The Blackstone/Cerberus Parties agree to use commercially
	reasonable efforts to (i) appoint a Replacement Vessel Manager as soon as
	practicable after the Effective Date and (ii) cause the Replacement Vessel
	Manager to assume full operational and management control of the Operating
	Vessels within approximately 60 days after the Effective Date. Subject to
	paragraph 3(e) of this Agreement, Product Manager shall not be entitled to any
	Management Fees (as defined in the Management Agreement) from Products Investor
	or the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties for the period from and after June 2, 2009,
	except for payments that are expressly provided for by this Agreement. Product
	Manager shall be entitled to receive from Products Investor, and Products
	Investor shall pay to Product Manager, all Reimbursable Expenses (as defined in
	the Management Agreement and including any such expenses as specified in
	paragraph 3(c) hereof as being Reimbursable Expenses) pursuant to Section 4.3
	of the Management Agreement which are incurred prior to the end of the
	Management Transition Period in providing Management and Operating Services
	under the Management Agreement or pursuant to this paragraph 3(a), consistent
	with past practice and regardless of whether incurred before or after the date
	of this Agreement. All payments of Reimbursable Expenses shall be made in the
	ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.




	43









	                    (b)     During
	the Management Transition Period, Debtors agree that Product Manager shall use
	commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist the Replacement
	Vessel Manager with an orderly transition of Vessel Manager duties with respect
	to the Operating Vessels. Upon completion of the Management Transition Period,
	or at such earlier time as Products Investor or the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties
	may request, upon at least five (5) business days notice, with respect to any
	Vessel, Debtors and their affiliates, crew, employees, staff, and agents shall
	immediately vacate all Vessels, unless Products Investor or the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties in their sole discretion determine to waive this
	requirement in writing on an individual-by-individual basis for specifically
	identified Vessel personnel (it being understood and agreed that any such
	individual may elect to remain in the employ of Debtors). The Parties agree
	that the Management Agreement and all rights and obligations of Product Manager
	thereunder shall be terminated upon completion of the Management Transition Period;
	provided, however, that Sections 4.3, 7, 8, 12 through 16, 18, 20 and 21 of the
	Management Agreement shall survive termination of the Management Agreement and
	shall apply to services rendered pursuant to this Agreement as though they were
	provided pursuant to the Management Agreement.




	44









	                    (c)     Debtors
	agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Products Investor and
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties in obtaining any consents, novations,
	authorizations, approvals, exemptions, notices or other agreements from third
	parties, including without limitation the U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command,
	Marathon Petroleum Company LLC and BP West Coast Products LLC, with regard to
	any charters, the appointment of the Replacement Vessel Manager, and all other
	matters contemplated in this Agreement, as may be reasonably requested by the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties, it being understood and agreed that (i) Debtors
	shall not be required to expend any funds in assisting the Blackstone/Cerberus
	Parties in obtaining any consents, novations, authorizations, approvals,
	exemptions, notices or other agreements from third parties hereunder unless
	such expenditure of funds is specifically requested by the Blackstone/Cerberus
	Parties in writing, in which event such funds expended by the Debtors shall be
	Reimbursable Expenses under the Management Agreement and reimbursed to Product
	Manager in accordance with the Management Agreement and (ii) the failure of
	Products Investor and the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties to obtain any consents,
	novations, authorizations, approvals, exemptions, notices or other agreements
	from third parties shall not affect the Settlement Payments due Product Manager
	hereunder.




	45









	                    (d)     As
	soon as practicable, Debtors shall deliver to Products Investor, the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties, and/or the Replacement Vessel Manager copies of
	all books, records, reports, and contracts of Products Investor, Vessel Manager
	(with respect to the Vessels) and the Vessels and all further information
	concerning Products Investors business, properties and, except to the extent
	prohibited by applicable law, personnel, including but not limited to the
	reports and statements set forth on

	Schedule A

	hereto, and any other
	reports required pursuant to the LLC Agreement, Management Agreement, and
	Credit Agreement as the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties may reasonably request.




	                    (e)     The
	Parties agree that, in the event all conditions to the Effective Date have been
	satisfied other than the condition in paragraph 1(b)(iv), until the Effective
	Date, Products Investor shall continue to pay to Product Manager, in accordance
	with the terms of the Management Agreement, (i) the Annual Management Fee (as
	defined in the Management Agreement) in respect of each Operating Vessel (all
	payments made pursuant to this Section 3(e)(i) being collectively referred to
	as the 

	Interim Management Fee

	) and (ii) the Oversight Fee (as defined
	in the Management Agreement) in respect of each Vessel under construction (all
	payments made pursuant to this Section 3(e)(ii) being collectively referred to
	as the 

	Interim Oversight Fee

	). For the avoidance of doubt, if all the
	conditions to the Effective Date other than the condition in paragraph 1(b)(iv)
	have been satisfied, Product Manager shall be entitled to receive from Products
	Investor, and Products Investor shall pay to Product Manager, promptly
	following the eleventh day after entry of the Approval Order, all Annual
	Management Fees and Oversight Fees that Product Manager would have received
	during the period beginning on June 2, 2009 and ending on the date hereof, and
	all payments of Annual Management Fees and Oversight Fees pursuant to this
	sentence shall be Interim Management Fees and Interim Oversight Fees for
	purposes of this Agreement.




	46









	                    (f)     The
	Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that simultaneous with the termination of
	the Management Agreement as set forth in paragraph 3(b), all obligations of
	USSP and USS JV Manager Inc. (

	JV Manager

	) to Products Investor under
	that certain Performance Guaranty, dated as of August 7, 2006, made by USSP and
	JV Manager to Products Investor (the 

	Performance Guaranty

	), shall be
	terminated and of no further force and effect; provided, however, that
	notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of USSP and JV Manager under the
	Performance Guaranty in respect of Product Managers obligations under Section
	7.3 of the Management Agreement shall survive termination of the Performance
	Guaranty.




	                    4.     

	Settlement
	Payments

	. On the Effective Date, the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties, jointly
	and severally, shall deposit Fourteen Million Dollars ($14,000,000) less the
	amount of Interim Management Fees and Interim Oversight Fees actually paid to
	Product Manager between the date hereof and the Effective Date into an escrow
	account (the 

	Escrow Account

	) pursuant to the terms of an escrow
	agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as

	Exhibit A

	for the
	purpose of funding the payment obligations in paragraphs 4(a) through 4(c). The
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties shall, in cases of paragraphs 4(a) through (c),
	cause distributions from the Escrow Account to, and Products Investor shall, in
	cases of paragraphs 4(d) and (e) directly pay, Product Manager at the times and
	in the manner set forth below (the 

	Settlement Payments

	):




	                    (a)     On
	the Effective Date, Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) by wire transfer of
	immediately available funds less 50% of the amount of Interim Management Fees
	actually paid to Product Manager between the date hereof and the Effective
	Date.




	                    (b)     On
	the 40

	th

	day following the conclusion of the Management Transition
	Period (or, if such date is not a business day, on the first business day after
	such date), subject to the orderly transition of vessel management with respect
	to the Operating Vessels as provided in paragraph 3(b), Two Million Three
	Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,300,000) less 50% of the amount of Interim Management
	Fees actually paid to Product Manager between the date hereof and the Effective
	Date.




	47









	                    (c)     Two
	Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,700,000) less the amount of Interim
	Oversight Fees actually paid to Product Manager between the date hereof and the
	Effective Date, such amount to be paid in equal monthly installments through
	December 2010, on the 17th day of each calendar month (or, if such date is not
	a business day, on the first business day after such date) commencing with the
	first month after the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt, from and
	after the Effective Date (i) Debtors shall have no obligation to, and shall
	not, perform Construction Supervision Services on behalf of Products Investor
	except, and then only, to the extent reasonably requested by Products Investor
	in writing and shall perform no other Construction Supervision Services
	pertaining to any of the Vessels, (ii) the payments due under this paragraph
	4(c) are due and payable whether or not Product Manager renders any
	Construction Supervision Services and (iii) neither Product Manager nor any
	Managers Covered Person (as defined in the Management Agreement) shall be
	liable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise to Products
	Investor, the JV Subsidiaries (as defined in the Management Agreement) or the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties for any losses, damages, liabilities, demands or
	expenses suffered by Products Investor, the JV Subsidiaries or the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties for mistakes of judgment or for action or inaction
	in performing Construction Supervision Services on behalf of Products Investor
	to the extent reasonably requested by Products Investor in writing pursuant to
	clause (i) of this sentence, except to the extent arising out of (A) the gross
	negligence or willful misconduct of such Managers Covered Person or (B) a
	violation of any Applicable Law (as defined in the Management Agreement) by the
	Managers Covered Person. The Blackstone/Cerberus Parties and Products Investor
	hereby agree to hold harmless and indemnify the Debtors for any damages or
	liabilities incurred by the Debtors during the period from the Effective Date
	through and until the completion of construction of the Vessels, arising from
	or related to the services performed by a person or construction manager other
	than Product Manager or as a result of Products Investor not appointing another
	person to provide Construction Supervision Services and not requesting Product
	Manager to provide such services.




	48









	                    (d)     Upon
	Delivery (as defined in the Construction Contract) of any of Vessels 3, 4 and
	5, to the extent Products Investor receives a provisional deduction in Progress
	Payments (as defined in the Construction Contract) made to NASSCO based on NASSCOs
	cost performance pursuant to Article 3(e) of the Construction Contract with
	respect to such Vessel (such deduction amount, a 

	Cost Under-run Provisional
	Deduction

	), Products Investor shall, within 2 days of making any Progress
	Payment that has been reduced to give effect to such Cost Under-run Provisional
	Deduction, pay Product Manager (by wire transfer of immediately available
	funds) an amount equal to 50% of the first One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) of
	any such Cost Under-run Deduction. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the
	aggregate amount that Product Manager may receive under this paragraph shall be
	up to, but not in excess of, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) and (ii)
	if Product Manager does not receive $500,000 in connection with any Cost
	Under-run Provisional Deduction in respect of Vessel 3, then additional amounts
	shall be paid from the Cost Under-run Provisional Deductions in respect of
	Vessel 4, if any, and, if necessary, Vessel 5, if any, until Product Manager
	has received a total of $500,000 in the aggregate under this provision;
	provided that any payment due under this paragraph 4(d) with respect to Vessel
	5 shall be made within 2 days after receipt of the Cost Under-run Payment (as
	defined below), if any, made by NASSCO to Products Investor.




	49









	                    (e)     Upon
	the expiration of Vessel 5s Guarantee Period (as defined in the Construction
	Contract), to the extent Products Investor receives a payment based on NASSCOs
	cost performance pursuant to Article 3(d) of the Construction Contract with
	respect to such Vessel (such deduction amount, a 

	Cost Under-run Payment

	),
	Products Investor shall, within 2 days of receipt of such Cost Under-run
	Payment, pay Product Manager (by wire transfer of immediately available funds)
	an amount equal to 50% of the first $500,000 of any such Cost Under-run Payment
	not applied to satisfy Products Investors obligations under paragraph
	4(d). For the avoidance of doubt, the
	aggregate amount that Product Manager may receive under this paragraph 4(e)
	shall be up to, but not in excess of, Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars
	($250,000).




	                    (f)     The
	payments to be made pursuant to paragraphs 4(a) through (e) shall be in
	settlement of the termination of the Management Agreement, and payment of
	management and other fees to have been paid thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, in addition to
	the payments to be made pursuant to paragraphs 4(a) through (e), Product
	Manager shall be entitled to receive, and Products Investor shall pay to Product
	Manager, in accordance with the terms of the Management Agreement, all
	Reimbursable Expenses incurred by Product Manager through the end of the
	Management Transition Period.




	50









	                    (g)     The
	Settlement Payments shall be in full settlement of any and all claims or
	interests whatsoever Debtors may have relating to Products Investor and the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties, other than claims for Reimbursable Expenses and
	indemnification under Section 7 of the Management Agreement, and in full settlement
	of all other claims being released by Debtors pursuant to this Agreement. The Settlement Payments shall be made by
	wire transfer to an account in the United States to be designated by Product
	Manager. Failure by Products Investor
	to make payments pursuant to paragraph 4(d) and (e) in accordance with the
	dates set forth in this Agreement shall not be deemed a default under this
	Agreement, unless a missed payment shall not have been cured within 3 business
	days following receipt by Products Investor, the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties,
	and their counsel, of written notice of such missed payment by the
	Debtors. With respect to the payments
	due under paragraphs 4(d) and (e), Product Investors shall provide Product
	Manager with notice of when the respective Vessels are delivered, and, if the
	aggregate amount to be paid thereunder to Product Manager is not paid with
	respect to any Vessel, documentation demonstrating in reasonable detail whether
	or not a Cost-under Run Payment is due and the calculation of the Cost-under
	Run Payment. For the avoidance of
	doubt, except as provided in paragraph 4(i), the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties
	obligations under this paragraph 4 shall be satisfied in full, with respect to
	each payment, upon the transfer of funds to the account or accounts designated
	by Product Manager for such payments.




	                    5.     

	Jan
	Ziobro

	. The Debtors hereby agree
	that as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, and for so long as Mr. Jan T.
	Ziobro is employed by any of Debtors or their affiliates (it being understood
	and agreed that Debtors shall have no obligation to retain Mr. Ziobro as an
	employee), Debtors shall, upon reasonable prior notice, provide to Products
	Investor and/or the person providing construction oversight services to
	Products Investor reasonable access to Mr. Ziobro promptly upon request in
	connection with oversight of Vessel construction, including following the
	termination of the Management Agreement, consistent with past practice. For the avoidance of doubt, no consideration
	shall be paid to Debtors in connection with the performance by Mr. Ziobro of
	such services beyond the Settlement Payments set forth in this Agreement.




	51









	                    6.     

	Vessel
	Sales

	. (a) With respect to any one or more Vessels, in the event Products
	Investor makes a

	bona fide

	decision to sell one or more of the Vessels then, prior to effecting any such
	sale of one or more of the Vessels, Products Investor shall provide written
	notice to Debtors that it intends to effect a sale of a Vessel or Vessels (a 

	Proposed
	Sale Notice

	).




	                    (b)     Within
	21 days of the date such Proposed Sale Notice is delivered to Debtors, Debtors
	may elect, by delivery of a

	bona fide

	written
	notice (a 

	Purchase Offer Notice

	) to Products Investor not later than
	the end of such 21 day period, to offer to purchase one or more of the Vessels
	offered. The Purchase Offer Notice
	shall include evidence reasonably satisfactory to Products Investor demonstrating
	that Debtors have adequate financial resources to timely consummate the
	purchase of the Vessel or Vessels. The
	terms of any Purchase Offer Notice shall expire on the tenth day following its
	delivery to Products Investor. If
	Products Investor accepts the Purchase Offer Notice within such ten day period,
	then Products Investor shall sell the Vessel or Vessels to Debtors on a date
	designated by Debtors that is not more than 120 days after the date the
	Purchase Offer Notice is accepted by Products Investor. For the avoidance of doubt, Products
	Investor is under no obligation to accept any Purchase Offer Notice.




	                    (c)     In
	the event that a Purchase Offer Notice was delivered but was not accepted by
	Products Investor, then Products Investor may sell the Vessel or Vessels to a
	third party purchaser free of any right of Debtors,

	provided

	,

	however

	,
	that Debtors will be permitted to fully participate as a bidder in, and not be
	subject to a negative bias in connection with, any such sales process. Products Investor shall exercise its
	commercially reasonable business judgment in conducting any sales process and
	in determining the successful bidder (if any) and the terms of any accepted
	purchase offer for any Vessel or group of Vessels.




	52

	Secured Notes due 2014.




	53









	                    (b)     As
	of the Effective Date and again as of the last day of the Management Transition
	Period, the Blackstone/Cerberus Parties, on behalf of themselves and on behalf

	54









	                    (c)     The
	Debtor Releasors and the Blackstone/Cerberus Releasors, in connection with and
	as part of the releases described in paragraphs 7(a) and (b) above, voluntarily
	waive Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, or any similar, comparable or
	equivalent provision of the statutory or non-statutory law of any other

	A general

	the debtor.







	55









	                    (d)     The
	Parties acknowledge that they may hereafter discover facts different from or in
	addition to those they now know or believe to be true with respect to the

	Releasors (i) shall not institute, commence, assert or prosecute against any of
	the Blackstone/Cerberus Releasees any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding
	of any kind or nature whatsoever, in law or in equity, directly or indirectly,
	whether by way of action, defense, set-off, cross-complaint, counterclaim or
	otherwise, and whether for payment, damages, loss, specific performance or
	otherwise, related to any claim to be released pursuant to paragraph 7(a)
	herein; and (ii) shall indemnify and hold each of the Blackstone/Cerberus
	Releasees harmless against any and all costs (including attorneys fees and
	expenses) and liabilities incurred by them as a result of the Debtor Releasors

	cross-complaint, counterclaim or otherwise, and whether for payment, damages,
	loss, specific performance or otherwise, related to any claim to be released
	pursuant to paragraph 7(b) herein; and (ii) shall indemnify and hold each of
	the Debtor Releasees harmless against any and all costs (including attorneys
	fees and expenses) and liabilities incurred by them as a result of the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Releasors breach of the foregoing clause 8(b)(i).




	56









	                    (c)     The
	provisions of paragraphs 8(a) and (b) shall be in full force and effect upon
	execution of this Agreement, and shall remain in effect upon the Effective Date
	and thereafter.




	                    9.     

	Dismissal
	of Actions

	. Upon the Effective
	Date, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, agreements and other
	consideration described in this Agreement, Debtors shall file or cause to be
	filed appropriate notices and/or stipulations dismissing the Adversary

	Confidential
	Information

	. The Debtors shall keep
	confidential, and cause their affiliates, and Debtors and their affiliates
	respective officers, directors, employees and advisors to keep confidential,
	all information relating to Products Investor and its subsidiaries, including
	but not limited to information related to their business, charters and related
	rates, vendors, customers, market analyses, financial information, business
	plans, employee compensation information, and contracts (collectively, 

	Confidential
	Information

	), except as required by law and except for information that is
	available to the public on the Effective Date, or thereafter becomes available
	to the public other than as a result of a breach of this paragraph 10. For purposes of this paragraph 10 the term
	Confidential Information should not include any information that (a) is or
	becomes generally available to the public or (b) was or becomes available to
	Debtors, its affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors,
	employees and advisors on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties or Products Investor.




	57









	                    11.     

	Restriction
	on Certain Amendments to LLC Agreement and Construction Contract

	. Products Investor shall not, and the
	Blackstone/Cerberus Parties shall not permit Products Investor to, amend in any
	respect (a) any provision of the LLC Agreement which would be effective for any
	period prior to the Effective Date, (b) the Construction Contract if such
	amendment would have the effect of (i) decreasing the Contract Price (as such
	term is defined in the Construction Contract) for any Vessel or (ii) increasing
	Contractors Actual Cost (as such term is defined in the Construction
	Contract), for any Vessel or (c) Articles 3(a), (c), (d) or (e), 5, 6, 7 or 9
	of the Construction Contract, if, and only to the extent that, any of the
	foregoing amendments of Articles 3(a), (c), (d) or (e), 5, 6, 7 or 9 of the
	Construction Contract could otherwise reasonably be expected to adversely
	affect Product Managers rights to receive payments pursuant to paragraph 4(d)
	or (e) of this Agreement. For the
	avoidance of doubt, no amendment shall be deemed to adversely affect Product
	Managers right to receive payments pursuant to paragraphs 4(d) or (e) of this
	Agreement so long as Product Manager receives the payments contemplated by
	those paragraphs at the time the payments would have been received but for the
	amendments. Notwithstanding anything
	to the contrary herein, Products Investor may amend the Construction Contract
	to defer progress and other payments to NASSCO for no more than six months and
	such amendments shall not be deemed to adversely affect Product Managers
	rights to receive payments pursuant to paragraph 4(d) or (e) hereof as long as
	such amendments do not have the effect of or result in a decrease in the

	the date hereof by another Party hereto, or (iii) any article appearing at any
	time after the date hereof in the press. Disparaging remarks, comments or

	Management Agreement and the proceeds thereof and (ii) the Bankruptcy Court has
	entered orders, including its order dated May 27, 2009 and any subsequent
	interim or final order that supercedes the May 27, 2009 order, that provides
	the Debtors secured lenders with a security interest in all of the property of
	the Debtors, now owned or hereafter acquired.

	Documentation is not so provided to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may be
	required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to withhold and
	promptly remit to the Internal Revenue Service a portion of any interest or
	other income earned on the investment of monies or other property held by the
	Escrow Agent pursuant to this Escrow Agreement.

	comply with any direction or instruction (other than those contained herein
	or delivered in accordance with this Escrow Agreement) from the Blackstone
	Entity or Product Manager or any entity acting on their behalf. Escrow Agent
	shall not be required to, and shall not, expend or risk any of its own funds

	confer, either express or implied, any legal or equitable right, remedy,
	benefit or claim to or upon any other entity or person whatsoever.








	 






	 








	3.






	If at any
	time Escrow Agent is served with any judicial or administrative order,
	judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative process

	Order). The Blackstone Entity, Product Manager and Escrow Agent shall use
	their reasonable best efforts to oppose or limit the effect of such Order.
	Escrow Agent is authorized to comply with such Order in any manner as it or
	its legal counsel of its own choosing deems reasonably appropriate; and if

	be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person or entity even
	though such Order may be subsequently modified or vacated or otherwise
	determined to have been without legal force or effect.








	 






	 








	4.






	          (a)          Escrow
	Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted or for any loss or

	acting in accordance with or relying upon any joint instruction, notice,
	demand, certificate or document from the Blackstone Entity or Product Manager
	or any entities acting on their behalf, in each case as permitted by this
	Escrow Agreement, (ii) for any consequential, punitive or special damages,
	(iii) for the acts or omissions of its nominees, correspondents, designees,
	subagents or subcustodians, or (iv) for an amount in excess of the value of
	the Escrow Funds, valued as of the date of deposit.

	any fees, expenses or costs incurred by, or any obligations owed to, Escrow
	Agent hereunder are not promptly paid when due, Escrow Agent shall give
	notice in writing to the Blackstone Entity and Product Manager of such
	failure to pay. If such fees, expenses or costs are not paid by the
	Blackstone Entity and Product Manager within ten (10) business days of such
	notice, Escrow Agent may reimburse itself therefor from the Escrow Funds and may
	sell, convey or otherwise dispose of any Escrow Funds for such purpose.

	Agent shall not incur any liability for not performing any act or fulfilling
	any duty, obligation or responsibility hereunder by reason of any occurrence
	beyond the control of Escrow Agent (including but not limited to any act or
	provision of any present or future law or regulation or governmental
	authority, any act of God or war, or the unavailability of the Federal
	Reserve Bank wire or telex or other wire or communication facility).

	usual collection practices or terms regarding items received by Escrow Agent
	for deposit or collection. Escrow Agent shall not be required, or have any
	duty, to notify anyone of any payment or maturity under the terms of any
	instrument deposited hereunder, nor to take any legal action to enforce
	payment of any check, note or security deposited hereunder or to exercise any

	writing signed by the Blackstone Entity and Product Manager. Escrow Agent may

	reasonably acceptable to the Blackstone Entity and Product Manager shall have
	been appointed and such appointment shall have been accepted by such

	twenty (20) calendar days after giving the foregoing notice of removal to
	Escrow Agent or receiving the foregoing notice of resignation from Escrow
	Agent, the Blackstone Entity and Product Manager shall jointly agree on and
	appoint a successor Escrow Agent. Any such successor escrow agent shall agree
	to be bound by the terms of this Escrow Agreement and shall, upon receipt of
	the Escrow Funds and any instruments in which the Escrow Funds have been

	apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
	Escrow Agent or for other appropriate relief. The costs and expenses
	(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by Escrow Agent

	receipt of the identity of the successor Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent shall
	deliver the Escrow Funds then held hereunder to the successor Escrow Agent,
	less Escrow Agents fees, costs and expenses or other obligations owed to
	Escrow Agent.








	 






	 








	 






	          (d)          Upon
	proper delivery of the Escrow Funds to a successor Escrow Agent in accordance
	with the terms hereof, Escrow Agent shall have no further duties,
	responsibilities or obligations hereunder.








	 






	 








	11.






	          (a)          In
	the event of any ambiguity or uncertainty hereunder or in any notice,
	instruction or other communication received by Escrow Agent hereunder, Escrow
	Agent may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action other than
	retain possession of the Escrow Funds, unless Escrow Agent receives written
	instructions, signed by the Blackstone Entity and Product Manager, which
	eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty.








	 






	 








	 






	          (b)          In
	the event of any dispute between or conflicting claims by or among the
	Blackstone Entity and Product Manager and/or any other person or entity with
	respect to any Escrow Funds, Escrow Agent shall be entitled, in its sole
	discretion, to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands or
	instructions with respect to such Escrow Funds so long as such dispute or
	conflict shall continue, and Escrow Agent shall not be or become liable in
	any way to the Blackstone Entity or Product Manager for failure or refusal to
	comply with such conflicting claims, demands or instructions. Escrow Agent
	shall be entitled to refuse to act until, in its sole discretion, either (i)
	such conflicting or adverse claims or demands shall have been determined by a
	final order, judgment or decree of the Bankruptcy Court, which order,
	judgment or decree is not subject to appeal, or settled by agreement between
	the conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing satisfactory to Escrow
	Agent or (ii) Escrow Agent shall have received security or an indemnity
	satisfactory to it sufficient to hold it harmless from and against any and
	all Losses which it may incur by reason of so acting. Escrow Agent may, in
	addition, elect, in its sole discretion, to commence in the Bankruptcy Court
	an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief or orders as it may
	deem, in its sole discretion, necessary. The costs and expenses (including
	reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such
	proceeding shall be paid by, and shall be deemed a joint and several
	obligation of, the Blackstone Entity and Product Manager.

	Patriot Act Disclosure.

	Section 326 of the
	Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to
	Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (

	USA PATRIOT Act

	)
	requires the Escrow Agent to implement reasonable procedures to verify the
	identity of any person that opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the
	parties acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Escrow
	Agents identity verification procedures require the Escrow Agent to obtain
	information which may be used to confirm the parties identity including
	without limitation name, address and organizational documents (identifying
	information). The parties agree to provide the Escrow Agent with and consent
	to the Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties any such identifying
	information required as a condition of opening an account with or using any
	service provided by the Escrow Agent.








	Security Procedures.

	In
	the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing at the
	time of execution of this Escrow Agreement), whether in writing, by facsimile
	or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such
	instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on
	schedule 1 hereto (

	Schedule 1

	), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
	confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated.
	Each funds transfer instruction shall be executed by an authorized signatory, a
	list of such authorized signatories is set forth on Schedule 1. The persons and
	telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually
	received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to
	contact any of the authorized representatives identified in Schedule 1, the
	Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by
	telephone call-back to any one or more of Blackstone Entity or the Product
	Mangers executive officers, (

	Executive Officers

	), as the case may be,
	which shall include the titles of______________________, as the Escrow Agent
	may select. Such Executive Officer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully
	executed incumbency certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
	confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow Agent and
	the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account
	numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by Blackstone Entity and the
	Product Manager to identify (a) the beneficiary, (b) the beneficiarys bank, or
	(c) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds
	for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even when
	its use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the
	transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiarys bank or an intermediary
	bank designated. The parties acknowledge that these security procedures are
	commercially reasonable.




	-12-









	IN WITNESS
	WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Escrow Agreement to be executed by
	a duly authorized officer as of the day and year first written above.
