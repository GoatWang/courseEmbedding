SACRAMENTO, Calif., July 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- SynGen Inc., a company focused on the development and commercialization of medical systems that harvest stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, peripheral blood, and other tissues, announced today that it has been granted FDA 510(k) clearance to market its three related products to process cord blood: 

SynGenXTM-1000 System: A programmable Control Module, Docking Station and Disposable Cartridge for harvesting stem and progenitor cells from units of collected cord blood. These cells are used to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of patients afflicted with hematologic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma and more than 70 genetic diseases. 
CryoPRO-2TM Cryopreservation/Storage Bag Set: A disposable processing set with a chamber into which the harvested stem and progenitor cells from the SynGenXTM-1000 are transferred, mixed with cryoprotectant and transferred under sterile conditions into a multiple compartment bag for freezing and storage at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-196o C). 
SynGen™ DataTrak software: The application code that provides the interface between the operator and the SynGenX™-1000 System through a host PC computer. It downloads processing and system information from the SynGenX™-1000 Control Module and stores it in a database on the host PC computer.
Earlier, the Company was awarded an ISO 13485:2003 Certificate of Registration and a Full Quality Assurance certificate by the British Standards Institution (BSI), which allows it to CE mark its own Class 1 products and commercialize them in the European Union (EU).
Philip Coelho, SynGen's CEO noted: "We thank the FDA for guiding us through the 510(k) clearance process. SynGen is dedicated to developing products that consistently exceed our customers' expectations. This "next generation" SynGenXTM-1000 System improves the recovery of stem and progenitor cells from cord blood units, which should increase the number of clinical grade units available for transplantation. The CryoPRO-2TM simplifies the cryopreservation workflow for cord blood bank personnel and provides a medical record of the process. The SynGen™ DataTrak software captures the data associated with processing each cord blood unit for the blood bank's records.  
"SynGen recently received additional financing from Bay City Capital to support our commercialization efforts. We look forward to providing U.S. cord blood banks with the competitive advantage they will enjoy by using our products."

SynGenX®-LAB SystemA revolutionary new process to isolate cell populations from bone marrow, blood or apheresis products.





SynGenX®-LAB System


The SynGenX®-LAB System is designed for the efficient isolation of target cell populations from bone marrow, blood or apheresis products in a closed device. It is intended for use in cell processing laboratories. The SynGenX®-LAB System automatically harvests the target cell population from starting materials during a short cycle on a programmable bench top centrifuge without the use of Ficoll or other additives.
In addition, the system’s firmware and SynGen®-DataTrak software generate a report of the entire centrifugation and harvest process, downloadable to the host PC for cGMP compliance. The SynGenX®-LAB system is available in the US, EU and UK.

FeaturesHow it WorksSupport & ResourcesFeaturesSynGenX®-LAB FeaturesBetter integration for GMP support.


The SynGen® DataTrak software is installed on the host’s PC and is the user interface for the SynGenX®-Lab System. The software allows the operator of the system to use a bar code reader to track and record equipment serial numbers and disposable lot numbers. The software also downloads process performance data from the Control Module to the host PC that includes important cGMLP support information:

Tracking centrifuge performance, including duration of periods at constant speed, accelerations and decelerations.
Opening and closing of the valves that direct target cells and red blood cells to their respective compartments at the base of the Disposable Cartridge.
Configured volumes of harvested target cells.
Documentation of the successful completion of the processing cycle.
 Space for sign-off of the data set by the lab director, if desired.

 
 
*The SynGenX®-LAB system is designed for the efficient isolation of cell populations from bone marrow, blood or apheresis samples, and is classified as general laboratory equipment.

How it WorksHow It Works





One unit, endless possibilities.



The SynGenX®-LAB System is designed for the efficient extraction of target cell populations from bone marrow or blood samples in a closed device.
The sample is transferred to the central sample chamber of the SynGenX®-LAB Disposable Cartridge via transfer tubing through a 150 micron filter to remove any clots and bone chips.








STEP #1Centrifugation







The Disposable Cartridge is latched onto the SynGenX®-LAB Control Module, placed in the centrifuge and counter balanced with a SynGen counterweight cartridge. During centrifugation, the sample is separated into three fractions:  red blood cells, target cells, and plasma.



STEP #2Stratification & Separation







The SynGenX®-LAB Disposable Cartridge features a cone-shaped region at the bottom of the central sample chamber where the cell fractions of the sample stratify during centrifugation.
Four vertically aligned, infrared sensor-pairs in the Control Module continuously monitor the region, detect cell fraction interfaces, and trigger opening and closing of the valves that direct the red blood cells and the target cells to their respective chambers.  This allows high precision separation and harvest of the target cells during processing.



STEP #3Analysis







The SynGenX®-LAB Docking Station transfers the data collected during the centrifuge run by the Control Module via SynGen™ DataTrak software installed on a PC.

Enhanced Cell TherapySynGen's innovative, scalable systems increase target cell recovery and redefine the regenerative medicine workflow.System Components





SynGenX®-LAB Disposable Cartridge



Each SynGenX®-LAB Disposable Cartridge can process a sample of bone marrow, blood or apheresis product with a volume between 40 mL to 240 mL. The Disposable Cartridge has three discrete compartments for separation of the sample into a defined volume of target cells, depleted red blood cells and the remaining plasma.
The target cells can be collected from the harvest chamber via the attached access tube, either by sterile-welding a transfer bag or by syringe via a luer-lock fitting.  Four disposable cartridges can be processed simultaneously, enabling nearly 1 liter of starting material to be processed.








SynGenX®-LAB Control Module





Separation made easy.



The SynGenX®-LAB Control Module automatically directs the separation of the target cells, red cells and plasma into their respective chambers, by monitoring the  speed of the centrifuge, and opening and closing valves at the base of the Disposable Cartridge at the right times.








SynGenX Docking Station





Powerful. Efficient. Simple.



The SynGenX Docking Station transfers the data collected during the centrifuge run by the Control Module to the host PC via SynGen® DataTrak software. It also charges the Control Module’s lithium polymer ion battery. A fully charged battery will allow the Control Module to operate an average of 5 days of normal laboratory operation.

The Disposable Cartridge is latched onto the SynGenX®-LAB Control Module, placed in the centrifuge and counter balanced with a SynGen counterweight cartridge. During centrifugation, the sample is separated into three fractions:  red blood cells, target cells, and plasma.



STEP #2Stratification & Separation







The SynGenX®-LAB Disposable Cartridge features a cone-shaped region at the bottom of the central sample chamber where the cell fractions of the sample stratify during centrifugation.
Four vertically aligned, infrared sensor-pairs in the Control Module continuously monitor the region, detect cell fraction interfaces, and trigger opening and closing of the valves that direct the red blood cells and the target cells to their respective chambers.  This allows high precision separation and harvest of the target cells during processing.



STEP #3Analysis







The SynGenX®-LAB Docking Station transfers the data collected during the centrifuge run by the Control Module via SynGen™ DataTrak software installed on a PC.

SynGenX®-LAB Disposable Cartridge



Each SynGenX®-LAB Disposable Cartridge can process a sample of bone marrow, blood or apheresis product with a volume between 40 mL to 240 mL. The Disposable Cartridge has three discrete compartments for separation of the sample into a defined volume of target cells, depleted red blood cells and the remaining plasma.
The target cells can be collected from the harvest chamber via the attached access tube, either by sterile-welding a transfer bag or by syringe via a luer-lock fitting.  Four disposable cartridges can be processed simultaneously, enabling nearly 1 liter of starting material to be processed.








SynGenX®-LAB Control Module





Separation made easy.



The SynGenX®-LAB Control Module automatically directs the separation of the target cells, red cells and plasma into their respective chambers, by monitoring the  speed of the centrifuge, and opening and closing valves at the base of the Disposable Cartridge at the right times.








SynGenX Docking Station





Powerful. Efficient. Simple.



The SynGenX Docking Station transfers the data collected during the centrifuge run by the Control Module to the host PC via SynGen® DataTrak software. It also charges the Control Module’s lithium polymer ion battery. A fully charged battery will allow the Control Module to operate an average of 5 days of normal laboratory operation.

FAQ | Syngen Inc.













































































































Frequently Asked QuestionsSupport for SynGen® Systems and DevicesFrequently Asked QuestionsSupport for SynGen® Systems and DevicesGeneral Hardware and Software Questions
What is the battery life of the SynGenX® Control Module?


The Control Module battery will last approximately 1 week between charges assuming normal usage (3-6 centrifugation runs per day).  However, it is always recommended that you check the battery status indicator when the Control Module is placed on the docking station before proceeding with a new run.


Since the Control Module battery is lithium ion, does it need to be drained?


The battery does not need to be drained.  There is no need to do anything special with respect to the battery.  Unlike Ni-CAD batteries, it has no “memory”.


What is the best way to store the Control Modules for long term?


The Control Modules can be stored safely on a shelf at room temperature for long term.  After such storage, however, it is a good idea to charge the battery overnight prior to initial use.


How do I return the Control Modules for annual maintenance?


In order to return a Control Module for its annual maintenance, you will need to:
a.    Contact Customer Service and request a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) for your Control Module.
b.    Customer service will provide you with:

An RMA Form to send back with your Control Module
A decontamination form to be completed and returned with the Control Module
Instructions for cleaning your Control Module
A Return Shipping Label

c.     You will need to follow the cleaning instructions and complete the decontamination form.
d.     Pack up the Control Module for shipment in the original box (if this is not available, we will supply a replacement).

An original copy of the decontamination form and a copy of the RMA form need to be included with the shipment.

e.     Ship the unit back to SynGen.


If I get an error message indicating the Control Module is no longer working correctly, how do I exchange it?


Control Modules under warranty will be replaced.  A replacement Control Module will be shipped to your site.  Your current Control Module can then be returned in the same packaging that your replacement was shipped in, following the instructions under step 4 above, indicating this is an under-warranty replacement.
If you would prefer to not have an exchange and wish to keep your current Control Module, you will need to ship that Control Module back to the SynGen, following the steps in step 4, above.  Indicate that you want to receive the same Control Module back after repair.
•     Please note – not all Control Modules can be repaired.  If the evaluation shows the Control Module cannot be repaired, you will be notified and a replacement will be shipped out.
For Control Modules that are not under warranty or service contract, contact SynGen directly for instructions.


Can I use a different centrifuge than specified?


We do not advise doing so.  Only the Thermo Fisher Sorvall™ Legend™ XT-Series centrifuge can be programmed to provide the linked cycle steps of g-force and time that SynGen has validated.   The 750 mL buckets are an exact fit for the SynGenX®– Disposable Cartridge.


With what computer operating systems is the SynGen® DataTrak software compatible?


Windows® 7 and Windows 8.1


For the SynGenX®-LAB System
What sources of cells can be processed with the SynGenX®-LAB system?


Bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood, Leukapheresis product, and thawed cellular products.


Can I use Ficoll in the SynGenX®-LAB system?


No. The SynGenX-LAB system was designed to replace the Ficoll process.


What volumes of cell sources can I process in a single SynGenX®-LAB Disposable Cartridge?


40 mL to 220 mL


What types of processes can be performed with the SynGenX®-LAB System?



Cell Harvesting
Cell Washing
Volume Reduction and Concentration
Cell Separation



What final volumes can I harvest my target cells into?


There are a number of variables that impact the final harvest volume, including:

The initial volume placed into the disposable cartridge for processing.
The volume of depleted cells removed and the target harvest volume

With the above considerations in mind, customized programming of the centrifuge and the Control Module allow a final target volume ranging from 3 to 25 mL.  Contact SynGen for details.


For the SynGenX®-1000 System and its Auxiliary Products
How much cord blood can be processed in a single SynGenX®-1000 Disposable Cartridge?


The Disposable Cartridge can process from 40mL to 220mL of cord blood.


What is the volume of the Mixing Chamber of the CryoPRO™ Cryopreservation/Storage Bag Sets?


The Mixing Chamber is designed to allow optimum mixing with 20-25 mL of buffy coat and cryoprotectant, but can hold a maximum of 30 mL of fluid.


What is the volume of the segment line tubing on the Freezing Bag?


The segment line tubing connecting to each of the compartments holds 0.1 mL/inch


Do I need to use HES when processing cord blood with the SynGenX®-1000 System?


HES is not required, but may be used if desired.


Should I choose to use HES, what is the recommended mixing time after adding HES to the blood in the collection bag?


Any added HES should be mixed in the collection bag by gently rocking about 45 degrees from side to side for a minute or so.  After this mixing, follow any additional protocols that have been established and validated within your lab.
After the HES and cord blood have been mixed in the collection bag, transfer the contents of the bag to the central compartment of the Disposable Cartridge and gently rock the cartridge about 45 degrees from side to side for a minute or so.
