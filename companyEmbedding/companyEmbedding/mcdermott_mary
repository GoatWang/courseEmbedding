Stacy Pratt McDermott on Mary Lincoln - Routledge
Stacy Pratt McDermott on Mary Lincoln"I set out to write a biography that illustrates the richly human  qualities of historical experience through the eyes of a woman who, like  all of us, was flawed." 	Stacy Pratt McDermott, author of Mary Lincoln: Southern Girl, Northern Woman, on why she chose to tell Mary Lincoln's story from her own perspective.When I began working at the Abraham Lincoln Papers in 1996, the venom  that Lincoln scholars spewed at Mary Lincoln bothered me. As a new  scholar in Lincoln studies at the time, I was reading everything I could  get my hands on, and the Mary haters were just impossible to escape.  They tended to present on the one hand, the kind, honest, and likeable  Mr. Lincoln, and on the other hand, his hateful, deceitful, unlikable  wife. Not only was this stark dichotomy historically inaccurate, but it  did absolutely nothing to better our understanding of Abraham Lincoln,  his marriage, or his life. I was always frustrated that Mary Lincoln had  such a bad reputation because of this ridiculous dichotomy. As the  years passed, I frequently grumbled against what I considered unfair  treatment of Mary Lincoln. I would complain about it with colleagues. On  a few occasions I even defended Mary Lincoln in the face of a hater or  two by trying to offer them a more nuanced explanation of her behavior,  her life, or her historical legacy. Yet I will admit that it never  occurred to me to write a biography that might counter all of that  negativity. I know now, however, that a Mary Lincoln biography was  churning around inside of me for a very long time. 	When my Ph.D. advisor Vernon Burton convinced me to tackle this  biography of Mary Lincoln—our most controversial first lady—I was a  little apprehensive. Yet after reading all of her more than 600 extant  letters, I found a path for the project that made me comfortable. When I  read Mary’s letters, I saw an intelligent, sensitive woman with a whole  lot of what we would today call baggage; and she was navigating fairly  well through a life that was both a blessing and a curse. I saw a woman  who had a great deal of strength, but was so very fragile at the same  time. I saw a woman who had great capacity to love and to learn and to  give, but who struggled every day to keep the past and the demons at  bay. After reading her letters, I decided to tell Mary Lincoln’s story  from her perspective and with as much of her intellect, her heart, and  her soul as I could glean from the words she has left us. Too long have  the historians appropriated, and misappropriated, her life and her  history to their own ends. 	Mary Lincoln was not a cartoon character. She was a living, breathing  person, who had real experiences. I set out to write a biography that  illustrates the richly human qualities of historical experience through  the eyes of a woman who, like all of us, was flawed. I find Mary  Lincoln’s life compelling because she was a complicated woman. She was  smart, intellectually curious, and social. Yet she was insecure, petty,  and reclusive. Mary Lincoln was the wife of Abraham Lincoln and that was  an extraordinarily important personal and historical fact of her life.  But Mary was also a daughter, a student, a sister, a mother, a friend,  and a widow. She was a nineteenth-century woman doing the best she  could. Sometimes her efforts exceeded even her own expectations,  sometimes they were just good enough, and sometimes they were  devastatingly insufficient. Her story is a human story, and I hope my  biography adequately captures Mary Lincoln’s humanity. Mostly, though, I  hope that I have written a life that she herself would recognize.Stacy Pratt McDermott is Assistant Director and Associate Editor, Papers of Abraham Lincoln.Related ProductsMary LincolnSouthern Girl, Northern WomanBy Stacy Pratt McDermottOne of America’s most compelling First Ladies, Mary Lincoln possessed a unique vantage point on the events of her time, even as her experiences of the constraints of gender roles and the upheaval of the Civil War reflected those of many other women.

Atomic Burger Slider Campaign
Client: Atomic BurgerChallenge: Promoting a new product, the Slider Box (where you can mix and match nine different sliders), to drive sales and reach a wide audience.Solution: We used this campaign as an opportunity to add whimsy and wonder to Atomic Burger's visual identity. In order to reach a wide audience and drive sales, we engaged this more robust visual identity on multiple channels, such as social media, email marketing, exterior menu boards, and interior table tents.Performed photography, illustration, and design. Art direction by Alli Morrison & Michelle Zande, strategy and copywriting by Devin Bambrick.




























































Atomic Burger Cookie Shake Campaign
Client: Atomic BurgerChallenge: To promote Atomic Burger's special cookie shakes: Thin Mint and Samoa. Solution: Pairing photography and illustration to create a fun, playful campaign where the customer earns a button (similar to a Girl Scout badge) for each flavor tried. Performed photography, illustration and design. Art direction by Alli Morrison & Michelle Zande, strategy and copywriting by Devin Bambrick.






























Tulane Learning Communities Promo
Client: Tulane Housing and Residence LifeChallenge: Creating a more emotional approach to convey information about the residential learning communities to students and encouraging them to live in the RLCs. Solution: A bright, vibrant brochure that recruiters can hand out to students, with photographs and summarized information broken down into bulleted lists. This brochure pointed students to the website, where there was more information about each RLC and a form to apply. Performed design and layout. Art direction by Kelley Wiedman & Michelle Zande, copywriting by Devin Bambrick, web development by Hite Billes.




































Advantage Tradeshow
Client: Advantage Medical ProfessionalsChallenge: To help Advantage stand out from other staffing agencies at a national tradeshow, and to collect contact information from as many of the attendees as possible for future recruitment efforts.Solution: Designing materials that reached beyond the booth with a social media contest that sent conference-goers on a selfie-seeking scavenger hunt up and down the Vegas Strip.Performed illustration and design.

Art direction by Michelle Zande, copywriting by Devin Bambrick, web development by Hite Billes.

Art direction by Alli Morrison.






























Personal Branding
Client: MyselfChallenge: Finding a way to visually represent myself and my work.Solution: A mark with an "M" hidden inside and reflected over itself and connected by curls / loops (which also alludes to my very bouncy, curly hair). The concept behind this never-ending loop, is that I believe the design is continuous and loops over itself multiple times.




































Ciao Calendar
Featured on Packaging of the World.Client: Student ProjectChallenge: Finding a way to design a calendar that the user will interact with every day. Solution: I created Ciao, an English-to-Italian Calendar, where consumers can greet each day by learning a new Italian word. They either see the Italian word first (with an illustration), or the English word first (with a number) and simply lift the tab to reveal the translation. At the end of the month, they can slide off the paper and pop out each perforated day for a memory card. This way, they can play a memory card game to review the words they learned throughout the month before their trip to Italy.Performed illustration, design, packaging, and product design. Art direction by professor Chaiwat Thumsujarit.
















































Evolution of Communication Stamps
Client: Student ProjectChallenge: Creating a Commemorative Stamp Series and designing a consistent feel from the small stamps to the larger collector sheets and book. Solution: Inspired by the evolution of communication, these stamps emphasize the Pony Express, telegraph, telephone, and wireless communication. I illustrated each time period, and created small collector’s sheets that represented each one, with their own specific timeline. When these collector's sheets are put together, they create a cohesive, larger timeline. Performed illustration, design, and layout. Art direction by professor Chaiwat Thumsujarit. 










































Fahrenheit 451 Cover Redesign
First Place in AIGA Nebraska’s SHOW 2015 Exhibition.Client: Student ProjectChallenge: Design a book two different ways: one that expresses the individuality of the story and writer through illustration, and the other as a drop cap.Solution: After choosing "Fahrenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury, I designed the first book to have a black jacket with “451” die cut out of it, hiding a majority of flames underneath, emphasizing the censorship within the society. Through the die cut, the reader can see only a bit of the flames. This represents the fact that the citizens within the dystopian society see that fires are happening, but are unaware of the truth behind them. The flames are sharp and pointed instead of organic to reflect the book’s harsh atmosphere. Under the black sleeve is intricate line work and stylistic features to evoke a classic novel.For the second book (drop cap), I focused on the contrast between the main character and the society in which he lives. The books that create the stem of the “f” have one book sticking out, creating the crossbar. The book that doesn’t quite fit on the shelf represents the main character, Montag. Performed illustration and design. Art direction by professor Karrie Simpson Voth.
