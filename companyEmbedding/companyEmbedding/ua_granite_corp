There are many well-established manufacturing, distribution and retail sales
companies in cut stone industry. Most of our competitors have greater financial
resources than we do and will be able to withstand sales or price decreases
better than we are. We also expect to continue to face competition from new
market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these
existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.


Company Description
UA Granite Corporation was incorporated on February 14, 2013, under the laws of
the State of Nevada, for the purpose of the development of web portals to 
market and distribute cut granite products from Ukraine. To implement our plan 
of operations we require a minimum funding of $ 82,693 for the


 next twelve 
months. In the event we do not raise sufficient capital to implement its 
planned operations, your entire investment could be lost.

---

We are in the early stages of developing our plan to distribute granite products
in forms including but not limited to countertops, chopped (or split) stone 
blocks, stone blocks with absolute sawn finish and with chopped-sawn (split and
sawn) finish for road surface, kerbstones (border stones), stairs and paving 
tiles with different kinds of surfaces (chopped, sawn, polished and flamed), 
decorative tiles with surface like “Rock” and many other kinds of products made
from natural granite of Ukrainian deposits.  We currently have no revenues, no 
operating history, and no orders to purchase granite products.  Our plan of 
operations over the 12 month period following successful completion of our 
offering is to develop and establish our granite products distribution business
by establishing our office, developing our website, attempting to enter into 
supply agreements with prospective retailers of granite products, engage in 
advertising and marketing activities and hire a sales person. We currently have
commercial granite products available, but do not expect to be selling such 
granite products until approximately 12 months following the completion of this
