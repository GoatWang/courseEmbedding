About Sempra Energy
With more than 16,000 employees, the Sempra Energy companies develop energy infrastructure, operate utilities, and provide related products and services to more than 32 million consumers worldwide.

Executing on Our Strategy
Sempra Energy is implementing a strategic plan focused on a balanced portfolio of growth businesses � regulated utilities and long-term contracted energy infrastructure. 


The Sempra Energy Story
Sempra Energy  was created in 1998 by a merger of parent companies of two long-established, and highly respected, investor-owned utilities -- Los Angeles-based Pacific Enterprises, the parent company of Southern California Gas Co., and Enova Corporation, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric -- with rich histories dating back more than a century.
Sempra Energy capitalizes on new opportunities in competitive energy markets. The company�s ongoing focus is to enhance shareholder value and meet customer needs by sustaining the financial strength, operational flexibility and skilled workforce needed to succeed in rapidly changing market conditions.
Our Companies
Sempra Energy operates two business segments � Sempra Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure � with six principal subsidiaries.
Sempra Utilities owns and operates electric and gas utilities in the U.S. and South America, including San Diego Gas & Electric and  SoCalGas in California, Luz del Sur in Peru, and Chilquinta Energía in Chile.
Sempra Infrastructure invests in, develops and operates long-term contracted energy infrastructure in the U.S. and Mexico. Its subsidiaries include Sempra Renewables, Sempra LNG & Midstream and Sempra Mexico.

This webpage contains statements that are not historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements can be identified by words like "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "plans," "estimates," "projects," "forecasts," "contemplates," "assumes," "depends," "should," "could," "would," "will," "confident," "may," “can,” "potential," "possible," "proposed," "target," "pursue," "outlook," "maintain," or similar expressions or discussions of guidance, strategies, plans, goals, opportunities, projections, initiatives, objectives or intentions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.  They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Future results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. 


Factors, among others, that could cause actual results and future actions to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements include: actions and the timing of actions, including decisions, new regulations, and issuances of permits and other authorizations by the California Public Utilities Commission, U.S. Department of Energy, California Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, states, cities and counties, and other regulatory and governmental bodies in the United States and other countries in which we operate; the timing and success of business development efforts and construction projects, including risks in obtaining or maintaining permits and other authorizations on a timely basis, risks in completing construction projects on schedule and on budget, and risks in obtaining the consent and participation of partners; the resolution of civil and criminal litigation and regulatory investigations; deviations from regulatory precedent or practice that result in a reallocation of benefits or burdens among shareholders and ratepayers; modifications of settlements; delays in, or disallowance or denial of, regulatory agency authorizations to recover costs in rates from customers (including with respect to regulatory assets associated with the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station facility and 2007 wildfires) or regulatory agency approval for projects required to enhance safety and reliability; the availability of electric power, natural gas and liquefied natural gas, and natural gas pipeline and storage capacity, including disruptions caused by failures in the transmission grid, moratoriums on the withdrawal or injection of natural gas from or into storage facilities, and equipment failures; changes in energy markets; volatility in commodity prices; moves to reduce or eliminate reliance on natural gas; the impact on the value of our investment in natural gas storage and related assets from low natural gas prices, low volatility of natural gas prices and the inability to procure favorable long-term contracts for storage services; risks posed by actions of third parties who control the operations of our investments, and risks that our partners or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual commitments; weather conditions, natural disasters, accidents, equipment failures, computer system outages, explosions, terrorist attacks and other events that disrupt our operations, damage our facilities and systems, cause the release of greenhouse gases, radioactive materials and harmful emissions, cause wildfires and subject us to third-party liability for property damage or personal injuries, fines and penalties, some of which may not be covered by insurance (including costs in excess of applicable policy limits) or may be disputed by insurers; cybersecurity threats to the energy grid, storage and pipeline infrastructure, the information and systems used to operate our businesses and the confidentiality of our proprietary information and the personal information of our customers and employees; capital markets and economic conditions, including the availability of credit and the liquidity of our investments; fluctuations in inflation, interest and currency exchange rates and our ability to effectively hedge the risk of such fluctuations; changes in the tax code as a result of potential federal tax reform, such as the elimination of the deduction for interest and non-deductibility of all, or a portion of, the cost of imported materials, equipment and commodities; changes in foreign and domestic trade policies and laws, including border tariffs, revisions to favorable international trade agreements, and changes that make our exports less competitive or otherwise restrict our ability to export; the ability to win competitively bid infrastructure projects against a number of strong and aggressive competitors; expropriation of assets by foreign governments and title and other property disputes; the impact on reliability of San Diego Gas & Electric Company's (SDG&E) electric transmission and distribution system due to increased amount and variability of power supply from renewable energy sources; the impact on competitive customer rates due to the growth in distributed and local power generation and the corresponding decrease in demand for power delivered through SDG&E's electric transmission and distribution system and from possible departing retail load resulting from customers transferring to Direct Access and Community Choice Aggregation; and other uncertainties, some of which may be difficult to predict and are beyond our control.


These risks and uncertainties are further discussed in the reports that Sempra Energy has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports are available through the EDGAR system free-of-charge on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov, and on the company's website at www.sempra.com. Investors should not rely unduly on any forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forecasts or projections or other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.


Sempra South American Utilities, Sempra Infrastructure, Sempra LNG & Midstream, Sempra Renewables, Sempra Mexico and Infraestructura Energética Nova, S.A.B. de C.V. (IEnova) are not the same as the California Utilities, San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) or Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), and are not regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission.

Business model of Sempra Energy
Customer Segments
Sempra Energy’s multiple operating segments serve a range of services and products to customers across the commercial and public sector, as well as to general consumers. These customers can be broadly categorised as follows:

General Consumers, with the Company providing utilities to residential customers;
Commercial Businesses, with the Company providing various utilities and energy services to businesses across multiple sectors;
Industrial Companies, with the Company providing utility and energy services to industrial operators, including manufacturing and production businesses;
Utility Electric Generation and Wholesale, which distribute and resell the Company’s utility and energy products; and
Public Institutions, including government bodies, to which the Company provides a range of services, including energy infrastructure and public lighting solutions.

Sempra Energy’s principal operating regions is its home market of the US, which accounts for the majority of the Company’s revenue. The Company also serves customers across Latin America, notably in Mexico but also in Chile and Peru.
Value Propositions
Sempra Energy provides value to its customers in the following ways:

The reliability and quality of its products and services, with the Company having established itself as a reliable and efficient utilities provider, securing a substantial customer bases across multiple customer segments, including public bodies and large commercial businesses;
Its industry expertise and experience, with the Company employing highly-trained specialist personnel across its multiple operating segments, led by a team of experienced industry executives; and
Its commitment to research and development, with the Company committing a portion of its resources to the development of new and innovative energy solutions, particularly in the field of alternative energy.

Channels
Sempra Energy operates a website at www.sempra.com, through which it provides information on its various services, activities, and projects. The nature of the Company’s services, however, is not conducive with the operation of an online sales channel.
Sempra Energy owns and operates its own network of storage, distribution and transmission infrastructure, through which it provides its natural gas and energy products. The Company deals with its clients directly through an in-house sales force, which is organised across the Company’s separate operating segments and geographic operating regions. Sempra Energy has offices across the US, Mexico, Chile and Peru.
To a lesser extent, Sempra Energy also utilises the distribution and sales services of third-party energy and utility wholesalers and power generation companies.
Customer Relationships
Sempra Energy does not provide any products or services to its customers on a self-service basis. The Company, instead, consults directly with its customers, working closely with clients to agree multi-year sales and distribution agreements. The Company also works closely with a number of organisations, including public bodies, collaborating in the development of energy infrastructure and utility projects across the Americas. Across all of its operating segments Sempra Energy seeks to establish longstanding customer relationships, with a view to securing recurring business.
Sempra Energy provides ongoing support to its clients. The Company provides contact details for its various operating segments and business divisions on its websites, providing personal responses to queries and enquiries from existing and potential customers. Sempra Energy operates several social networking accounts, including with Twitter and LinkedIn, through which it can interact directly with clients and post updates on its corporate developments.
Key Activities
Sempra Energy operates as a holding company. Through its various operating subsidiaries, the Company provides a range of utility and energy infrastructure services to commercial, industrial, public, and residential customers.
The Company's principal operating units are San Diego Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Gas Company, Sempra International – which includes Sempra South American Utilities and Sempra Mexico segments, and Sempra US Gas and Power – which includes Sempra Renewables and Sempra Natural Gas segments. The Company owns energy and utility distribution infrastructure across the US and Latin America, including a natural gas-fired power plant in Baja California, natural gas distribution systems in Mexicali, underground gas storage facilities and pipelines across multiple US states, and a regasification facility in Hackberry, Louisiana.
Key Partners
Sempra Energy’s multiple operating segments collaborate with a range of companies in the provision of their various products and services. These partners include:

Supplier Partners, including suppliers of services, resources, tools, and technology that support and supplement the Company’s own suite of services;
Joint Venture Partners, comprising a rage of energy and utility companies, with which the Company collaborates on joint projects through mutually-owned entities;
Strategic and Alliance Partners, comprising a range of partners across various sectors with which the Company shares resources and collaborates on joint projects; and
Channel Partners, comprising a range of energy and utility distributors, wholesalers and power generation companies, that assist in delivering the Company’s products and services to clients.

Sempra Energy participates in a solar energy partnership with Consolidated Edison Development, through which it holds a stake in several solar energy facilities. It is also a 50-50 partner alongside Mexico’s state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos in operating a natural gas distribution network that begins at the US border.
Sempra also has a range of community and corporate social responsibility partners. This includes a recent tie-up with Habitat for Humanity, under which the Company’s staff assisted in construction of homes in Mexico.
Key Resources
Sempra Energy’s key resources are its gas and electricity supplies, its production and distribution infrastructure – including pipelines and power generating facilities, its various operating permits and licences, its sales and distribution channels, its information and technology systems, its partnerships, and its personnel.
Sempra Energy owns and leases a number of offices and facilities across the US and Latin America, including office complexes, warehouses, maintenance centres, and service facilities, and own certain equipment that is key to its activities. The Company also owns or part-owns various gas pipeline networks, underground gas storage facilities, power generation plants, regasification facilities, and energy distribution networks that are key to the Company’s ability to provide core energy services.
While Sempra Energy is involved in research and development activities, the Company does not appear to have any patents or intellectual properties that are material to the success of its ongoing activities.
Cost Structure
Sempra Energy incurs costs in relation to the purchase of gas and electricity, the operation and maintenance of its production, storage and transmission infrastructure, the acquisition of relevant permits and licences, the operation of its sales and distribution channels, the maintenance of its information and technology infrastructure, the management of its partnerships, and the retention of its personnel.
In 2015 Sempra Energy accrued total operating and maintenance costs in the amount of $2.90 billion. The Company also accrued substantial utilities expenses, including costs related to the purchase of natural gas totalling $1.34 billion and costs related to the purchase of electric fuel and power totalling $2.14 billion. Sempra Energy also incurs occupancy costs relating to the operation of its network of international offices, and personnel costs comprising the payment of salaries and benefits to its global workforce of more than 17,000 employees.
Revenue Streams
Sempra Energy generates revenue through the provision of various energy and utility services. This includes tariff revenues and tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity, revenue derived under capacity services agreements, and revenue derived from terminal service agreements, as well as revenue derived from the provision of energy marketing, scheduling and related services in support of sales of generated power.
In 2015 Sempra Energy generated $10.23 billion in annual revenue, down slightly on the $11.04 billion recorded by the Company in 2014. The majority of this revenue was derived from the Company’s utilities businesses, which amounted to $9.25 billion, with San Diego Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Gas Company recording respective revenue of $4.22 billion and $3.49 billion, and Sempra South American Utilities generating $1.54 billion.

History[edit]
Sempra Energy was created through the 1998 merger of Los Angeles-based Pacific Enterprises, the parent company of SoCalGas, and Enova Corporation, the parent company of SDG&E.[3]
Sempra was sued over claims it manipulated natural gas supplies and electricity contracts during the 2001 California electricity crisis. In 2006, the company agreed to pay $377 million to settle gas supply claims, and in 2010 another $410 million to settle claims on electricity price gouging, but has never admitted wrongdoing.[4]
Awards and rankings[edit]
Sempra Energy ranked No. 279 on the 2016 list of Fortune 500 companies.[5] Sempra ranked No.16 among gas and electric utilities.[citation needed]
Sempra Energy was named to the 2015 list of the “100 Best Corporate Citizens”[6] by Corporate Responsibility Magazine for excellence in seven categories including: environmental stewardship, climate change, human rights, employee relations, financial performance, philanthropy and corporate governance.
Sempra Energy has been named one of the best places to work by the Human Rights Campaign each year from 2013-2016.[7] As the largest civil rights organization, Human Rights Campaign represents a force of more than one million members and supporters nationwide working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.
In 2015, Sempra Energy was named to:

Sempra Energy is an American natural gas utilities holding company based in San Diego, California. It divides its interests into two broad categories: California utilities, including Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E); and businesses not subject to California utilities regulation, chiefly Sempra International and Sempra U.S. Gas & Power.[1][2]
For 2015, Sempra Energy reported more than $10 billion in revenue and 17,000 employees, serving more than 32 million customers worldwide. It is the largest natural gas utility in the United States in terms of coverage area and population served, and is a major force in international natural gas markets.

History[edit]
Sempra Energy was created through the 1998 merger of Los Angeles-based Pacific Enterprises, the parent company of SoCalGas, and Enova Corporation, the parent company of SDG&E.[3]
Sempra was sued over claims it manipulated natural gas supplies and electricity contracts during the 2001 California electricity crisis. In 2006, the company agreed to pay $377 million to settle gas supply claims, and in 2010 another $410 million to settle claims on electricity price gouging, but has never admitted wrongdoing.[4]
Awards and rankings[edit]
Sempra Energy ranked No. 279 on the 2016 list of Fortune 500 companies.[5] Sempra ranked No.16 among gas and electric utilities.[citation needed]
Sempra Energy was named to the 2015 list of the “100 Best Corporate Citizens”[6] by Corporate Responsibility Magazine for excellence in seven categories including: environmental stewardship, climate change, human rights, employee relations, financial performance, philanthropy and corporate governance.
Sempra Energy has been named one of the best places to work by the Human Rights Campaign each year from 2013-2016.[7] As the largest civil rights organization, Human Rights Campaign represents a force of more than one million members and supporters nationwide working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.
In 2015, Sempra Energy was named to:

Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
MSCI Global Sustainability Index
Thomson Reuters U.S. Large Cap ESG Index[8]

Subsidiaries[edit]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
