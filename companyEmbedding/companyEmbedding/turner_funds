Portfolio Manager

				Scott Swickard, CFA


	*Formerly known as the Turner Spectrum Fund and and subsequently Turner Titan II Fund


	 


	The Turner Titan Long/Short Fund invests in stocks of companies with primarily large capitalization ranges across all major industry sectors using a long/short strategy in seeking to capture alpha, reduce volatility, and preserve capital in declining markets.

 Investment Objectives
	The Turner Titan Long/Short Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation and is intended for investors seeking long-term growth of capital.

 Investment Process
	We understand the DNA of great growth companies:





	The heart of Turner’s stock selection process is fundamental analysis. For long positions, we seek to identify:


	Global companies benefiting from change:


Accelerating earnings
Improving expectations
High returns on capital


	Industry leaders:


Strong management
Sustainable earnings, margins, and revenue growth
Compelling new products and services
Open-ended business opportunities
Market share gains


	For short positions, we seek to identify companies that exhibit the following:


Decelerating earnings prospects and declining business momentum.
Overwhelming competitive or financial challenges with negative near-term catalysts.
Loss of market share due to poor execution or a lack of innovation.
Questionable accounting practices and deteriorating operating models.

 Risk Disclosure
The performance data quoted represents past performance and the principal value and investment return will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown here. Please call 800.224.6312 or visit our website www.turnerinvestments.com for performance current to the most recent month end. Returns shown, unless otherwise indicated, are total returns, with dividends and income reinvested. Returns spanning more than one year are annualized. Fee waivers are in effect; if they had not been in effect performance would have been lower.


Past performance can vary over short periods. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


	Since it purchases equity securities, including common stocks, the Fund is subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time.  These factors contribute to price volatility, which is the principal risk of investing in the Fund.  


	 


	The Fund may focus its investments from time to time on one or more economic sectors.  To the extent that it does so, developments affecting companies in that sector or sectors will likely have a magnified effect on the Fund’s net asset value and total return.


	The Fund is subject to the risks associated with selling securities short. A short sale involves a finite opportunity for appreciation, but a theoretically unlimited risk of loss. 


	The smaller capitalization companies the Fund invests in may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. Therefore, small cap stock prices may be more volatile than those of larger companies.


	The Fund is subject to risks due to its foreign investments.  Foreign investments may be riskier than U.S. investments because of factors such as foreign government restrictions, changes in currency exchange rates, incomplete financial information about the issuers of securities, and political or economic instability.  Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The risks associated with foreign investments are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Such investments tend to fluctuate in price more widely and to be less liquid than other foreign investment.


	The Fund is subject to risks associated with the use of options, including: (1) the success of a hedging strategy may depend on an ability to predict movements in the prices of individual securities, fluctuations in markets and movements in interest rates; (2) there may be an imperfect correlation between the movement in prices of options and the securities underlying them; (3) there may not be a liquid secondary market for options; and (4) while the Fund will receive a premium when it writes call options, it may not participate fully in a rise in the market value of the underlying security.

Capital Gains


All mutual funds, regardless of performance, must distribute to shareholders any net realized gains from the sale of individual securities in their portfolios. Distributions are made to those who are registered shareholders of the fund on the record date. Distributions are paid on the pay date. All dates and distributions are subject to board approval. Distributions will vary depending on the funds' income and any profits realized from the sale of securities in the funds' portfolio. Past distributions are not indicative of future trends. A fund's per share capital gain distributions are the same for each share class offered.


Below is the list of Turner Funds and capital gains distributions, as of December 19, 2016. Capital gains are payable to the shareholders of record as of December 16, 2016 (the "Record Date") with the distribution occurring on December 20, 2016 (the "Payable Date"). These estimated distributions can change prior to the distribution date due to market activity and change in shares outstanding. The distributions do not include ordinary income distributions the fund may be making. In December, we plan to provide final estimates, including a breakdown between long and short-term gains and income, for all funds. Final distribution amounts will be added to each fund's profile page after the fund's declaration date in December. Shareholders are strongly advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of their investments in the funds.


To estimate your distribution for a fund on this list, multiply the number of shares you own by the fund’s total per-share capital gains estimates.

Portfolio Manager

				Jason Schrotberger, CFA


	The Turner Small Cap Growth Fund is a diversified portfolio of small capitalization stocks that Turner believes offers strong earnings growth potential. Generally, the Fund will invest in companies with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion at time of purchase. 

 Investment Objectives
	To produce capital appreciation. 


Investment Policy
	The Turner Small Cap Growth Fund invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of common stocks with small market capitalizations at the time of purchase that Turner believes offer strong earnings growth potential.

 Investment Process
	The Fund is designed to add value strictly through superior stock selection, based on the output of extensive, fundamental research. The goal of our investment process is to identify candidates for investment that are growth companies with above-average earnings prospects.


	We believe that innovation drives earnings and earnings drive stock prices. We believe that buying companies that are innovative, accelerating growth, disrupting others, and leading their respective market segments generates superior returns over time.

We understand the DNA of great growth companies:



 Risk Disclosure

		The performance data quoted represents past performance and the principal value and investment return will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown here. Please call 800.224.6312 or visit our website www.turnerinvestments.com for performance current to the most recent month end. Returns shown, unless otherwise indicated, are total returns, with dividends and income reinvested. Returns spanning more than one year are annualized. Fee waivers are in effect; if they had not been in effect performance would have been lower.
	

		Past performance can vary over short periods. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
	



		Since it purchases equity securities, including common stocks, the Fund is subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time. Historically, the equity markets have moved in cycles, and the value of the Fund's securities may fluctuate drastically from day to day. Individual companies may report poor results or be negatively affected by industry and/or economic trends and developments, and the prices of these companies' securities may decline in response. These factors contribute to price volatility, which is the principal risk of investing in the Fund. In addition, common stocks represent a share of ownership in a company, and rank after bonds and preferred stock in their claim on the company's assets in the event of liquidation.
	

		The Fund is also subject to taxable income and realized capital gains. Shareholder redemptions may force the Fund to sell securities at an inappropriate time, also resulting in realized gains.
	

		The Fund may participate in initial public offerings ("IPOs"). Some successful IPOs may have a significant impact on the Fund's performance, especially if the Fund has lower asset levels. There is no guarantee that there will be successful IPOs, or that the Fund will have access to successful IPOs. In addition, as Fund assets grow, the positive impact of successful IPOs on Fund performance tends to decrease.
	

		The Fund may buy and sell securities frequently as part of its investment strategy. This may result in higher transaction costs and additional tax liabilities.
	

		The smaller capitalization companies the Fund invests in may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. In particular, these small companies may have limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and may depend upon a relatively small management group. Small cap stocks may be very volatile and the price movements of the Fund's shares may reflect that volatility. Such volatility may make selling a large quantity of shares of one issuer more difficult.

Federal Mogul Asbestos TrustOriginally started in the early 1900s as a metal bearing and bushing manufacturer, Federal-Mogul diversified its portfolio over the years to include a wide range of automotive and construction businesses, including Turner & Newall. Even though Turner & Newall was purchased years after it stopped producing asbestos-laden building materials, Federal-Mogul was still responsible for some nearly 400,000 asbestos-disease claims. As Federal-Mogul added more companies under its umbrella in the years that followed, asbestos claims skyrocketed to more than a half-million.Federal-Mogul was created in 1899 through a partnership between a metal ball bearing manufacturer and a bushing producer. In the decades that followed, Federal-Mogul diversified and purchased scores of companies, including Turner & Newall, now known for its widespread and reckless use of asbestos. The United Kingdom-based T&N was one of the first companies in the world to industrialize asbestos.In purchasing many of these companies, Federal-Mogul knew the potential liabilities from asbestos and set aside $2.1 billion to settle claims. As asbestos claims began, Federal-Mogul attempted to dodge bankruptcy by laying off employees and closing manufacturing plants. The company grossly underestimated the extent and cost of the claims and, in 2001, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. By 2007, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court confirmed the fourth amended joint plan of reorganization. Today, Federal-Mogul operates in 34 countries through 169 manufacturing, distribution and technical facilities.Dangerous OccupationsFederal-Mogul’s core company did not involve asbestos use, but the company exposed itself to asbestos liability after purchasing several businesses that dealt directly with asbestos products. Some of the Federal-Mogul jobs most at risk for asbestos exposure include the following:Factory and plant workersMechanicsElectriciansRailroad workersBoiler operatorsShipyard workersRefinery workersFreeTrust Fund GuideHave your packet sent to you by overnight delivery.Free Packet Includes:Ways to Access Asbestos TrustsHow to Obtain CompensationFinancial Assistance for Treatment

Amount of Money in TrustAs a result of the bankruptcy, Federal-Mogul was ordered to establish trusts for its subsidiaries facing the most asbestos liabilities. There are at least four Federal-Mogul trusts funded with a total of $685 million: Federal-Mogul Products, Turner & Newall, Fel-Pro and Vellumoid.Like other asbestos trust funds, Federal-Mogul only pays claimants a percentage of the requested funds. This ensures there will be enough money for current and future claims.Questions?Contact us now for immediate answers to your questions.

Many lawsuits have focused on asbestos-containing automotive parts, building materials and manufacturing supplies.

Turner & Newall

Company History
Turner & Newall, an asbestos product manufacturer and mine operator, was founded in Rochdale, England in 1871 by brothers John, Robert and Samuel Turner. Originally known as Turner Brothers, the company started off manufacturing cotton, cloth-based packaging, and as one of its claims to fame, was the first company in the United Kingdom to weave asbestos fibers into cloth. After that 1879 innovation, Turner Brothers changed its name to Turner Brothers Asbestos Company.
A 1920 merger with Washington Chemical Company, Newalls Insulation Company and J.W. Roberts led the company to change its name to Turner & Newall. The company grew rapidly throughout the 1930s and 1940s by acquiring Bell’s United Asbestos Companies and several other asbestos insulation companies throughout the U.K. Starting in 1939, Turner & Newall operated an asbestos mine in the country of Swaziland in Southern Africa; the company continued operating the mine until 2001.
After World War II, Turner & Newall became involved in other areas of asbestos product manufacturing: The company acquired the Zimbabwe-based Porters Cement Industries in 1953 and renamed it Turnall Fibre Cement Ltd. – “Turnall” being a combination of the two names “Turner” and “Newall.”
In 1998, the Michigan-based automotive supplier Federal-Mogul Corporation acquired Turner & Newall. But Federal-Mogul was overwhelmed by asbestos-related lawsuits against its new subsidiary and put Turner & Newall into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001.
Products Manufactured by Turner & Newall that Contained Asbestos
When Turner & Newall got its start in the asbestos business, the health risks associated with the mineral were relatively unknown. While there had been an inkling that asbestos could be harmful as early as the 1st century A.D. – when Greeks and Romans noticed that slaved forced to weave asbestos cloth frequently came down with lung afflictions – it would be nearly two millennia before anything was done about it.
However, there is evidence that leaders at Turner & Newall were aware of the health risks for decades and allowed their workers to get sick anyway. In 1937, the company’s director reportedly wrote, “All asbestos fibre dust is a danger to the lungs. If we can provide evidence from this country that the industry is not responsible for any asbestosis claims, we may be able to avoid tiresome regulations and the introduction of dangerous occupational talk.”
Asbestos – a naturally occurring mineral mined from deposits like the one operated by Turner & Newall in Africa – was used in a wide range of products starting in the late 1800s. Its strength, resistance to heat and fire and its low price tag made it a popular choice for manufacturers. But we now know that asbestos is comprised of long, crystalline fibers that, when inhaled, can cause debilitating lung diseases like mesothelioma cancer and asbestosis.
One of the products made by Turner & Newall that contained asbestos was Limpet Spray, a spray used for structural fireproofing, acoustical ceiling treatments and for insulating turbines and other heat-generating equipment. The company also manufactured Tafford Tile asbestos cement sheets, a product used in the walls and roofing of industrial and agricultural buildings.
The following is a list of Turner & Newall products believed to have contained asbestos, along with the years they were manufactured, if known.

Occupations at Risk for Asbestos Exposure
People who worked at Turner & Newall’s factories up until the 1970s recall being completely surrounded by asbestos dust. According to one news report, measurements taken outside the factory’s roof in 1950 and 1957 showed levels of asbestos dust between 18 and 60 particles per cubic centimeter; safe working levels for the company were supposed to be two or three particles per cubic centimeter. Workers recalled regularly sweeping asbestos dust off the floor and even spitting the substance out of their mouths. In this type of environment, all workers were at risk.
Individuals who worked on sites where Turner & Newall products were used were also at high risk of exposure. Turner & Newall Limpet Spray was used “all over the World for acoustical treatment in public buildings, industrial plant, railway rolling stock, road vehicles, ships, etc.,” according to a 1960 product catalogue. Airports, underground tunnels and even the rotating restaurant at the top of the Space Needle in Seattle, Washington were sprayed with the substance, Turner & Newall newsletters said in the early 1960s. Workers who applied this spray, worked on demolition at these sites, or who simply worked in the vicinity of the product could have been exposed.
And of course, anyone who labored in one of Turner & Newall’s asbestos mines in Africa was put at an extremely high risk of being diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease.
Recent News
Facing an overwhelming number of asbestos-related lawsuits, Turner & Newall filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001. The company emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2007 with a trust created by its parent company, Federal-Mogul, to pay for future asbestos liabilities.
As of 2009, Turner & Newall’s heavily-contaminated Rochdale, England factory site remained in ruins, according to a news report, though new owners plan to build hundreds of homes there.

Asbestos Exposure









Many American workers, across a variety of industries, were exposed to asbestos on the job. As a result, they are now at risk to develop mesothelioma.
In this section, learn about the history of asbestos use, about the products that contained asbestos and about the companies that manufactured them.  Find out which occupations and trades are at higher risk for asbestos exposure.  Learn which job sites across the United States were contaminated with asbestos containing materials and about the risks associated with handling asbestos.
What is Asbestos?

Long considered a miracle material, asbestos boasts excellent fire- and heat- resistant properties. This naturally-occurring mineral, now known to be a human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent), has a history that dates back to ancient Greece. Asbestos was used as a building material, even as far back as during the Roman Empire. Asbestos was a component of fabric that would be used in clothing and a variety of other textiles.
During the Industrial Revolution, asbestos use grew in factories and other heavy industries throughout the United States. Asbestos was used not only in factories, but also in oil refineries, chemical plants, on railroad cars, and in shipyards. Asbestos materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives, to line tanks and ovens in refineries, and could be found literally everywhere aboard the nation’s ships, from engine rooms to galleys. As the twentieth century progressed, more uses for asbestos were found. It was used in the brakes and clutches of automobiles, insulated America’s new skyscrapers, and was used extensively in the construction industry, where it was used in asbestos products like joint compounds, cements, roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, siding, stucco, plaster, and much more. Those workers at risk included any that worked in an asbestos-heavy industry or frequently handled asbestos products.
By the middle of the twentieth century, it became apparent that asbestos was causing health problems. Asbestos exposure is now known to cause mesothelioma. This asbestos-related cancer can occur when asbestos is inhaled and the microscopic fibers become lodged within the outer lung tissue layer known as the mesothelium. This thin layer of cells protects and lubricates the chest cavity. Asbestos causes a sustained inflammation of these cells resulting in harmful scar tissue forming on the surface. This scar tissue lays the foundation for cancerous cells to develop.
Despite knowledge of the health risks posed by asbestos, historical records indicate that many companies who used asbestos in their facilities knew that the material was dangerous, yet continued to allow its use. Over time, as stories of sick employees became commonplace, the American government began to consider imposing laws about regulating the use of asbestos.

Asbestos Exposure in the United States

Exposure usually occurred at major construction jobsites, in shipyards, aboard navy vessels, and during construction or renovation of commercial buildings. People working in the vicinity of boilers and insulated piping often are at risk. In addition, teachers, students, and other staff members who work in older school buildings may be at risk of exposure to asbestos products, such as ceiling or floor tiles. Equally at risk are families of these workers, as asbestos often was carried home on clothing.

If you worked at a jobsite where asbestos or asbestos containing products were used, you may be at risk to develop mesothelioma.

Different Types of Asbestos Exposure

Military Exposure
Asbestos was used across all branches of the military for  many years. Navy veterans were exposed to high levels of asbestos while serving  on ships (aircraft  carriers, destroyers, submarines, battleships, warships,  etc.) in the naval fleet as well as in naval shipyards across the country. Army  veterans were exposed to asbestos in buildings on military installations and  while working on military vehicles. Air Force veterans were exposed while  working with military aircraft. Marine Corps veterans that spent time at sea  aboard Navy ships were exposed to asbestos. All veterans exposed to asbestos  have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma.
Commercial and Industrial Exposure
Many workers and maintenance contractors at industrial and  commercial job sites were subjected to dangerous levels of asbestos on the job.  Asbestos is a known carcinogen and the primary cause of mesothelioma cancer.  The types of jobsites where asbestos exposure occurred include oil refineries, power  plants, steel  mills and chemical plants to name a few. They all have “high heat”  environments where the use of fire and heat resistant materials was required,  be it in the construction of the plants or machinery or in the protective  clothing that workers were required to wear in designated areas (i.e.  fire-proof gloves and aprons). Today, even though the use of asbestos has been  banned in the United States, many existing industrial and commercial structures  may still contain a certain level of asbestos. It is important that appropriate  safety precautions be taken, where necessary, to prevent harmful exposure and  to mitigate the risk of developing mesothelioma.
Commercial Product Exposure
Do-it-yourself home renovation enthusiasts, as well as those  who worked in the construction trade, may have been exposed to asbestos while  working with popular building and construction products. Many of these products  were made with asbestos through the late 1970’s as the projects they were to be  used in required that they be heat and fire resistant. They included insulation,  roofing material, siding, joint  compound, ceiling tiles, flooring and more. Unfortunately when any of these  products were cut, sawed filed, or sanded, asbestos fibers were released into  the air. In the majority of cases, those working with the products did not use  appropriate safety precautions because asbestos companies withheld information  about the health hazards of asbestos for many years. Today, as a result,  construction workers and do-it-yourselfers are at risk for developing  mesothelioma or other asbestos-related  diseases.
Second Hand Exposure
Direct, on-the-job asbestos exposure did not affect American  workers alone. Their family members were also at risk of developing an  asbestos-related disease as a result of second  hand asbestos exposure. This type of exposure occurred when workers brought  asbestos fibers home on their hair, clothing or shoes at the end of the work  day. Those responsible for laundering their work clothes, day in and day out,  were most commonly affected, but even small children who spent time with their parent  before they had a chance to “clean up” from work were unknowingly placed at  risk of developing an asbestos-related illness.
Talc Exposure
Talc is a naturally occurring silicate mineral most commonly used in cosmetics and toiletries. Talc mineral on its own is believed to be safe, but talc deposits are often found near and among asbestos deposits. Due to this, some talc deposits are contaminated with asbestos fibers causing talc miners to be unknowingly exposed to asbestos. While talc miners are at the greatest risk of asbestos exposure, some consumer products, namely baby powder and, more recently, children’s art supplies, have been found to contain asbestos and cause regular users, mostly women, to be exposed to asbestos. Today, products using talc are tested for asbestos, but that was not always the case. Because mesothelioma has a long latency period, miners and consumers are being diagnosed with mesothelioma decades later from their job and use of the asbestos-containing talc products.

Unions Protect Workers from Asbestos Exposure

 Throughout the United States and across the world, hundreds of labor and trade unions are in place to protect individuals who work in myriad industries, from steel workers to plumbers, to electricians.  Unions have for a long time played a significant role in protecting workers right when it comes to asbestos exposure on the job. Unions have organized witnesses for court cases, have stepped forward to financially aid widows and children of those diagnosed with mesothelioma, and have fought against inadequate trust funds proposed by mega-companies to compensate asbestos victims.

Compensation for Workers Exposed to Asbestos

If you have developed health problems associated with asbestos exposure, you may be entitled to compensation.  Each state has its own deadlines, called statutes of limitations, which allow victims of asbestos exposure to file lawsuits.

 The Green Century Funds
Approach
Green Century is a leader in environmentally and socially responsible investing. Through our three-pronged approach, we offer investors the opportunity to make an impact in a way no other mutual fund family can: through investing in sustainable companies; our leading shareholder advocacy program; and our unique ownership, where 100% of the profits earned managing the Green Century Funds can be used to support the environmental and public health work of our non-profit owners. 
Green Century believes that companies that seek to protect the environment by avoiding dangerous practices and policies may be more profitable in the long run since they may be likely to have less exposure to devalued or stranded carbon assets, they may avoid costly litigation, and may be better prepared for new regulatory restrictions. Green Century also believes that companies that pay attention to environmental, social and governance factors and take proactive actions around public health and environmental issues may enjoy a competitive advantage in appealing to consumers concerned about a company’s commitment to sustainability, and avoid damage to their brands.
Investment Strategy
All our Funds avoid these dangerous industries and corporations:
• Fossil fuel companies
• Fossil fuel fired utilities and companies with carbon reserves
• Producers of GMOs (genetically modified organisms)
• Civilian firearms and military weapons companies
• Nuclear power companies
• Companies that derive revenues from tobacco



And instead seek to invest in companies that:
• Have outstanding rankings on environmental factors, including performance on critical environmental impacts
• Apply extensive sustainability criteria throughout their supply chains
• Minimize risks to air, water and public health
• Act as socially responsible companies in the communities in which they operate
• Rank highly on governance factors
• Are environmental innovators such as energy efficiency and clean energy companies
• Are sustainable agriculture companies involved in natural and organic foods


The MSCI International Index Fund
The Green Century MSCI International Index Fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies in developed markets chosen for their outstanding environmental, social and governance factors.  This passively managed Fund invests in the stocks of companies included in the MSCI World ex USA SRI ex Fossil Fuels Index, customized to screen out fossil fuel companies.
Learn moreThe Equity Fund
The passively managed Green Century Equity Fund invests in the stocks of hundreds of U.S. companies that comprise the longest-running sustainability index, the MSCI KLD 400 Social ex Fossil Fuels Index, customized to screen out fossil fuel companies.
Learn more The Balanced Fund

Five Reasons to Consider Divesting from Fossil Fuels








October 16, 2013Share this page:Facebook89Twitter0LinkedIn5
Click to view PDF version
Since fall 2012, colleges, churches and cities have been leading robust discussions and moving to divest their holdings in the fossil fuel industry. Inspired by these actions, individual investors also have been moving their money out of coal, oil and gas companies.
Green Century has nearly a decade of experience with fossil fuel free investing and more than two decades of success with shareholder advocacy. This moment in history offers investors a unique opportunity to make a difference on climate change, while saving for their future.
Here are the top five reasons to consider divesting from fossil fuel companies:
1. Get Your Investments in Line with Your Values
Climate  change  is  a  serious  threat  to  our  society,  and  burning  fossil  fuels  is  a  main  cause  of worsening  floods,  droughts,  and  wildfires.  Many  investors  want  to  keep  their  investments  away from the industry that is principally responsible for causing a changing climate. Divesting allows you to align your beliefs with your investment decisions – an alignment that is being increasingly sought by young and old alike.
2. Reduce Corporate Influence on Energy Policy

Fossil fuel companies have tremendous influence over legislation and regulations, through lobbying in  state  capitols  and  Congress.  For  years,  this  power  has  helped  thwart  progress  on  the  policy solutions to climate change. The fossil fuel divestment campaign is inspired by the successful South African divestment campaign, and aims to exert similar pressure on the companies and institutions standing in the path of needed change.
3. Strengthen the Climate Movement
Climate change is so profound, and the solutions so wide-ranging, that it is often a challenge for people to find a way to make a powerful difference. The divestment strategy is successfully engaging the  public.  A  coordinated  and  organized  climate  change  network  –  that  includes  mayors,  church leaders and college students – is essential to passing needed energy policies.
4. May Reduce Exposure to Stranded Carbon Assets
The fossil fuel industry now controls reserves of coal, oil, and  gas  that  –  if  extracted  and  burned  –  will  release  five times more carbon dioxide than scientists agree is safe.* If governments restrict carbon emissions, companies owning those  fossil  fuel  reserves  may  not  be  able  to  extract  and sell them. The reserves may become stranded assets, and investors may then be left with devalued assets. Divesting now  could  allow  investors  to  reduce  their  exposure  to  a possible collapse of the so-called “carbon bubble.”
5. Reinvest in the Solutions
Once  divested  from  fossil  fuels,  investors  have  the opportunity to invest in forward-looking climate solutions, like companies specializing in energy efficiency, renewable energy, or other related climate mitigation strategies.

Visit greencentury.com/fossilfuelfree or call 1-800-93-GREEN (1-800-934-7336).
The Green Century Balanced Fund is already fully divested from fossil fuel companies and re-invested in green solutions.
The Green Century Equity Fund is divested from coal and major oil companies, and invests in the longest running socially responsible index.
Next Steps
Each investor must decide whether divesting from fossil fuels meets his or her objectives. But every day, more investors are deciding it is the right path forward.

 Why Choose Green Century
Our three-pronged approach offers investors the opportunity to make an impact through the power of their investments in a way no other socially responsible and sustainable mutual fund family can.
 




1. Investing in Sustainable Companies




2. Leading Shareholder Advocacy Program




3. Supporting Environmental and Public Health Non-Profits






1. Sustainable Investment Strategy
For 25 years, Green Century has helped individuals and institutions invest for their future without compromising their values. Green Century believes that environmentally responsible investing also offers potential financial benefits and there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that investing with environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance may offer financial advantages. For example, we believe that when companies avoid harming the environment, communities in which they operate, and public health, they may not only enjoy a competitive advantage by appealing to consumers concerned about sustainability, but also may avoid damage to their brand reputations and costly litigation.
Green Century offers three mutual funds:

The Green Century MSCI International Index Fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies selected for their outstanding environmental, social and governance performance.
The Green Century Equity Fund  invests in the stocks of the companies included in the longest-running socially responsible index customized to exclude any fossil fuel companies in the index.
The Green Century Balanced Fund  invests in the stocks and bonds of environmentally responsible companies as well as green bonds, which finance climate mitigation projects worldwide.





SRI and Values-Based Exclusions


Fossil fuel companies – coal, oil and gas


Nuclear power companies


Military weapons and civilian firearm companies


Producers of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)


Tobacco companies





Examples of Sustainable Companies with Outstanding ESG Ratings


Energy efficiency; Renewables; Water treatment & conservation; Air pollution control


Sustainable infrastructure and transportation


Companies that disclose policies and performance on critical environmental impacts


Sustainable agriculture companies, including organic and natural food suppliers


Companies that apply sustainability criteria throughout the supply chain



Green Century uses values-based or socially, responsible, and impact (SRI) investing screens to avoid the most environmentally and socially dangerous industries. This aligns investments with the values of our investors and also offers potential financial benefits, such as avoiding stranded assets that may be associated with investing in coal, oil and gas companies.
Green Century also employs environmental, social, and governance ratings and performance to only select those companies that perform better across these categories as compared to companies in the same sector.
While some other investments may just use one or the other or the above methodologies, Green Century uses both to deliver high impact investments.

Fossil Fuel Free Investing:
Green Century is the first family of responsible and diversified fossil fuel free mutual funds in the U.S. Our fossil fuel free commitment exceeds the global divestment baseline of avoiding the largest 200 fossil fuel companies as ranked by potential carbon emissions content of their reported reserves. Green Century goes beyond this initial list since we have found that when investors decide to eliminate dirty energy from their portfolios for ethical and/or financial reasons, they more often want to eliminate them from their portfolios entirely.
Our definition of fossil fuel free investing excludes companies that explore for, extract, process and refine, and transmit coal, oil and gas, as well as companies that burn fossil fuels to make electricity or any companies with carbon reserves.
As more investments are described as environmental or fossil fuel free, we believe it is important to keep these distinctions in mind:
“Low carbon” is not the same as fossil fuel free. It might be, but it also might apply to carbon emissions and carbon reserves, or it might just apply to the overall carbon footprint of an investment.  Since there is no standardized characterization of the term, you should review the prospectus (see below) for exclusions and also look in the energy and utility sector holdings section of a fund. Note that “energy sector” may roughly translate to “fossil fuel companies” and holdings noted in the “utility sector” may be fossil fuel burning utilities or may be likely to be involved in fossil fuel extraction and consumption.
Review the prospectus. Marketing terms are not the same as investment strategies and binding exclusion, such as avoiding fossil fuel companies, and should be spelled out in the prospectus. The prospectus is a legal document that should always be available to a prospective investor that contains a fund’s objectives, investment strategies, risks, as well as other details. Without a clear statement addressing what fossil fuel free means in the prospectus, an investor cannot be sure what the fund may or may not invest in. Green Century details our definition of fossil fuel companies and avoidance of these companies in our prospectus. You can review the prospectus of the Green Century Funds by clicking here.
Our commitment to fossil fuel free investing is one way we help our investors avoid the very companies and industries at the heart of many environmental and social issues as well as potential financial risks associated with oil price volatility and stranded assets.

What about Performance?
There are growing concerns about investing in coal, oil and gas including the volatility of oil prices, capital expenditures on high-cost projects such as off-shore and Arctic drilling, and the potential of devalued or stranded carbon reserve assets. Fossil Fuel Divestment at Green Century.
These concerns are just some of the reasons Green Century has a long-standing investment strategy of avoiding the worst polluting companies and instead investing in companies that are helping build a sustainable economy. Read one of these recent studies on performance by leading industry analysts:

2. Leading Shareholder Advocacy Program
Even corporate sustainability leaders have room for improvement, which is why Green Century works with dozens of companies every year to adopt stronger environmental practices and policies throughout their supply chains.
 
Forest Protection Campaign
Deforestation is a leading cause of increased carbon emissions, which contribute to global climate change. Deforestation also poses a number of tangible business risks, which could include but are not limited to, current legal liabilities in emerging markets, pending legislation, reputational risk, and the ability to access raw materials to maintain revenue streams.
To help curb climate change, and limit our investors’ risks, Green Century has launched a five-year campaign to help stop deforestation caused by the production of soy, cattle, timber, rubber, and palm oil in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. In addition to other successes, the campaign has helped secure a zero-deforestation commitment from Wilmar,* the world’s largest palm oil trader, that will avoid 1.5 gigatons of carbon pollution between 2015 and 2020.
To learn more about our efforts and successes regarding our commitment to help stop deforestation, please download Green Century’s Forest Protection Campaign four-pager below or visit our Forest Protection page.
Sustainable Agriculture Program
Sustainable agriculture is the production of food, fiber, or other plant or animal products using farming practices that protect the environment, human health, and animal well-being. It is this form of agriculture that will provide an increasing global population the ability to produce plentiful, healthful food well into the future without destroying the environment or threatening human health.
At Green Century, we are currently working to decrease antibiotic misuse, the use of confinement cages and gestation crates, and promoting plant-based proteins.
To learn more about our specific efforts and successes, please download Green Century’s Sustainable Agriculture Program two-pager below.

3. Supporting Environmental and Public Health Non-Profits

One-hundred percent of the profits earned managing the Green Century Funds are used to support the environmental and public health work of non-profit organizations.
Currently, our non-profit owners are working toward ending the overuse of antibiotics on factory farms, banning fracking whenever possible, and securing carbon pollution regulations. And, to date, these organizations have accomplished incredible success, including:


Helping support a proposition that upheld a statewide ban on plastic bags in California
Gaining permanent protection of natural and archaeological wonders by creating three national monuments in California, Nevada and Texas
Securing protection for thousands of rivers and drinking supply sources across the country
Expanding solar energy through the Million Solar Roofs Initiative in California, influencing Massachusetts’ policy to power 50,000 homes with solar energy and securing pro-solar policies in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota, New Jersey and North Carolina

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
