Waste Plastic Conversion into Chemical Product Like Naphtha    Moinuddin Sarker, Mohammad Mamunor Rashid, and Mohammed Molla    Department of Research and Development, Natural State Research, Inc., 37 Brown House Road, Stamford, CT 06902, USA     Received 7 January 2011; Accepted 12 February 2011   http://www.ashdin.com/journals/jfrea/R110101.aspx   Abstract    Thermal degradation of waste plastics is one method currently being investigated as an alternative to landfill disposal of this increasingly large waste stream. Although the thermal process produces significant quantities of light naphtha range (C6–C14) liquids, there is also a residual fraction that may be considered as a potential feedstock for upgrading. In this study, the fraction of a liquid produced by the thermal degradation process of waste plastics, containing about 29%, +110°C naphtha chemical, was subjected to thermal reactions. The reactions used a commercial HZSM-5 supported on zeolite catalyst and gave good conversion to naphtha. The process well simulated the experimental data, including experimentally observed trends such as the maximum in naphtha yield.    References   A. Angyal, N. Miskolczi, and L.

The Plastic2Oil Advantage
With its revolutionary Plastic2Oil (P2O) technology, Plastic2Oil Inc. has pioneered the development of a process that derives ultra-clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel which does not require further refining, directly from unwashed, unsorted waste plastics. At Plastic2Oil®, we advocate environmental sustainability while energizing local economies through the creation of green jobs. We expect our P2O technology will transform waste management practices to redefine the recycling landscape and how we recycle tomorrow and into the future.Our P2O technology has successfully overcome significant barriers in the fuel industry. Some of the key differentiators of our process are outlined below.Validation & PermittingReputable independent labs have validated the P2O technology including IsleChem (process engineering) and Conestoga-Rovers & Associates (emissions stack test).
Plastic2Oil® has been issued all necessary permits to operate by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC).
Plastic2Oil® has been issued an exemption from Air Permitting in the state where the first site will be located for the agreement with Rock-Tenn Company ("RockTenn").
Engineering report performed by SAIC validates and verifies the technology and economics.
ProcessorThe processor requires only 4,500 sq. ft. of operating space.
Height requirement is approximately 20 ft.
Highly automated; very low operator to processor ratio.
Modular design allows for easy deployment.
InputsThe P2O processor accepts unwashed, unsorted waste plastics. Optimal feedstock includes polyethylene and polypropylene.
The P2O process is permitted by the NYSDEC for up to 4,000 lbs. of plastic feedstock per machine per hour at the Company's Niagara Falls, NY facility.
ProcessThe conversion ratio for waste plastic into fuel averages 86%.
Approximately 1 gallon of fuel is extracted from 8.3 lbs. of plastic.
The processor uses its own off-gases as fuel (approximately 10-12% of process output); minimal energy is required to run the machine.
Approximately 2-4% of the resulting product is Petcoke (Carbon Black), a high BTU fuel.
Emissions are lower than a natural gas furnace of similar size, and the quality of the emissions improve with increased feed rates.
Results from the final stack test performed by Conestoga-Rivers & Associates confirm that the processor emissions are well within the limits allowable under a NYSDEC air permit.
The process operates at atmospheric pressure, and is not susceptible to pinhole leaks and/or other problems with pressure and vacuum-based system.
The reusable catalyst is produced economically.
The fuel produced is refined and separated without the high cost of a distillation tower.
Resource UsageThe P2O processor is designed to use minimal amounts of external energy.
As well as being beneficial for the environment, this is also a significant factor in the commercial viability of the process.
Water is used for cooling only and usage is minimized through recycling the water in a non-contact closed loop. The water is not in contact with the process itself, keeping it clean and uncontaminated.
Only 53 kWh electricity is required to run the fans, pumps and small motors. No electricity is used in the transformation of the plastic to fuel.
Natural gas is only used on start-up to heat the reactor – once the processor is running, the reactor is heated with its own off-gases.
A facility-wide gas compression system governs natural gas usage throughout the entire production process.
Fuel OutputFuel quality has been validated by multiple independent petro-chemical labs including: Intertek, PetroLabs, Alberta Resource Council and Southwest Research Institute.
All shipments leaving the P2O plant in Niagara Falls are tested by the Company's fully equipped internal fuel testing lab.
Fuel is ready for sale upon completion of processing without the need for further refinement.
From a single processor the Company can produce a range of fuel products, without further refining, including No. 2 Fuel (Diesel, Petroleum Distillate), No. 6 Fuel, Naphtha, Petcoke (Carbon Black), and Off-Gases to be used in the P2O process.

Fuel Analysis Equipment
Plastic2Oil® has a fully equipped fuel testing laboratory, which includes:Molecular Analysis EquipmentGC/MS – Gas Chromatograph with Mass SpectrophotometerGC/FID – Gas Chromatograph with Flame Ionization DetectorAAS – Atomic Absorption SpectrometerDistillation UnitFuel Specifications Analysis Equipment ISL Sulphur AnalyzerISL Silicon AnalyzerISL Cloud Point TesterISL Pour Point TesterISL Flash Point TesterCentrifugeLab FurnaceTemperature Controlled Environmental Chamber with RecorderThis equipment allows us to handle special and/or specific fuel orders from customers.Fuel ProductsFrom a single P2O processor Plastic2Oil® can produce a range of fuel products, which do not require further refining.No. 6 FuelNo. 6 Fuel is heavy fuel generally used in industrial boilers and ships.No. 6 Fuel produced by the P2O process is the Company’s cleanest product when compared with existing industry standards, containing less than 16 ppm of sulphur in comparison with the maximum of 30,000 ppm allowable in mainstream No. 6 Fuels. Other No. 6 Fuel products are residue products of the refining process and are considered residue fuels, whereas Plastic2Oil’s No. 6 Fuel is a direct product of its P2O process, meaning it does not require further blending.Plastic2Oil’s No. 6 Fuel is a clear brown liquid at temperatures of 90º F. It has been tested by major industrial users with positive results.No. 2 Fuel (Diesel, Petroleum Distillate)No. 2 Fuel is a mid-range fuel commonly known as furnace oil or diesel. When No. 2 Fuel is used for industrial purposes as furnace oil, it does not require any additives. If the fuel is to be used as diesel, it must have a lubricity and anti-oxidant additive. 100% of the Plastic2Oil's No. 2 Fuel is derived from waste plastic and does not require blending.NaphthaNaphtha is a very light fuel that is used as a cut feedstock for ethanol or as white gasoline in high and regular grade road certified fuels. Butane and additives are typically required, along with blending, to make Naphtha road-ready.The Naphtha produced by the P2O process is ultra-clean and ultra-low sulphur.Petcoke (Carbon Black)Petcoke (Carbon Black) is a carbonaceous solid produced as the result of the carbon cracking process. Because of its high BTU (British Thermal Unit) value, the highest industry usage of Petcoke is by steel manufacturers who use it to fire their blast furnaces.Plastic2Oil® produces Petcoke through the P2O process and will be seeking a BUD (Beneficial Use Determination) to sell this product to end-users.Off-GasesApproximately 10-12% of the output of the P2O process is a range of off-gases, including butane, propane and hydrogen.Plastic2Oil® utilizes these off-gases to run the P2O processor.

Converting Waste Plastic to Ultra-Clean, Ultra-Low Sulphur Fuel
Plastic2Oil® is a clean energy company that recycles waste plastic into liquid fuels. PTO's proprietary Plastic2Oil® technology can deliver economic and environmental benefits by replacing refined fuels and diverting waste plastic from landfills. More









Processor No. 3 Online
Plastic2Oil® successfully brings its third P2O processor online at the Company's Niagara Falls, NY facility. More

The P2O Advantage
With its revolutionary Plastic2Oil (P2O) technology, Plastic2Oil Inc. has pioneered the development of a process that derives ultra-clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel, directly from unwashed, unsorted waste plastics.More

Bordynuik ASME Paper
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers publishes a paper by John Bordynuik on the viability of diesel production with P2O. More



Global Vision ... Local Impact
In the mid-1990s, when the founder of Plastic2Oil® was working at the Ontario Legislature he began to notice a trend: an increase in plastic waste resulting from growing plastic generation ... without recycling. Thinking forward, as he so often does, he saw the seed of an enormous problem looming.
In the ensuing 15 years, the problem he foresaw has manifested. Because of the new "disposable mentality" that came with plastic containers, we now are navigating the fallout of an enormous waste plastic problem, on a global scale. It's complex, it's far-reaching and it's intimately tied to politics and economics.The nugget of the problem that he had been thinking about all these years was what to do with the plastic waste we now generate – in the US alone, over 31 million tons a year are generated with only approximately 8% being recycled (2010).Over the years, there have been various solutions proposed – diversion, burning, etc.; however, nothing to date has proven to be a truly effective or environmentally responsible solution to the burgeoning global landfill problem. In fact, many existing solutions have been just the opposite: costly, energy inefficient or equally as harmful to the environment as the plastic itself. It's only now, with the Plastic2Oil technology, that there is a solution that is not only economically viable, but that is remarkably simple and "green" as well.
