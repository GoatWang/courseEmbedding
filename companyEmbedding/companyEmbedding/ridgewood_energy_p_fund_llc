Ridgewood Energy Closes Latest Fund At $1.1 Billion

		  Fund Focused on Deepwater Oil Exploration and Production

						 from   Ridgewood Energy Corporation 











 
















































 

 




















 


MONTVALE, N.J. and HOUSTON, Jan. 13, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Ridgewood Energy Corp. ("Ridgewood Energy" or "Ridgewood"), a private upstream oil and gas investment company based in Montvale, New Jersey, and Houston, Texas, has closed its latest private equity fund, Ridgewood Energy Oil and Gas Fund II, L.P. ("Fund II"), with total commitments of $1.1 billion, reaching its hard cap.  The Fund, which had an original target amount of $750 million, has been formed by Ridgewood to invest in exploration and production of oil projects in the U.S. deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
Fund II is a continuation of Ridgewood Energy's investment program focused on generating superior risk adjusted returns for investors by drilling and developing high-potential new oil fields.
The Fund's commitments were sourced from 39 institutional investors, including a number of leading state and union pension plans, well-known university endowments and foundations, and a number of Fund of Funds, private wealth managers and family offices.
Kenny Lang, Ridgewood Energy's President, said, "Our focused investment strategy, coupled with disciplined execution, has demonstrated the potential to generate enormous value for our funds' limited partners.  We aim to continue delivering on that strategy for our Fund II LPs."
Fund II has already invested in two oil wells, one of which, the Dantzler Project, was drilled in partnership with Noble Energy Inc. (NYSE:   NBL) and resulted in an oil discovery (see Noble Energy Press Release).
Robert Swanson, Ridgewood's Founder and Chairman said, "We are extremely pleased with the strong reception to our latest private equity fund, which we believe reflects the growing importance sophisticated investors place on focused, value-added investment strategies executed by a specialized team of professionals with deep, industry-specific knowledge."   
Robert Gold, Senior Managing Director of Ridgewood, said, "We particularly appreciated receiving strong support from a diverse set of institutional investors with significant expertise in energy.  Fund II provided these investors with targeted asset-class exposure, along with the potential to deliver true alpha."
Ridgewood's $1.1 billion in commitments secured by Fund II comes in addition to $700 million in capital and commitments Ridgewood currently manages on behalf of Riverstone Holdings, LLC, ("Riverstone") the energy-focused private equity firm, through entities known as ILX Holdings I, LLC and ILX Holdings II, LLC (which are affiliates of Riverstone's two most recent private equity funds).  
Eaton Partners, LLC, based in Rowayton, CT, acted as placement agent for the fund.  Vinson & Elkins LLP, served as fund counsel.

HOUSTON and MONTVALE, N.J., July 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Ridgewood Energy Corporation ("Ridgewood Energy"), a private upstream oil and gas investment company based in Houston, Texas and Montvale, New Jersey, today announced that it has closed its latest private equity fund, Ridgewood Energy Oil & Gas Fund III, L.P. ("Fund III").  Fund III, Ridgewood Energy's largest fund to date, significantly exceeded its $1.5 billion target and closed with total capital commitments of more than $1.9 billion.  
Fund III is a continuation of Ridgewood Energy's investment program focused on finding and developing oil in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $20 per barrel or less. The Fund's commitments were sourced from leading institutional investors, including state and corporate pension plans, university endowments and foundations, as well as a number of private wealth managers and family offices.  
Kenny Lang, Ridgewood Energy's President and Chief Operating Officer said, "Our limited partners continue to recognize the outperformance potential of Ridgewood Energy's deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil strategy, where we have the ability to find and develop significant oil reserves for a very low cost per barrel.  Our disciplined approach allows us to deliver strong returns across a range of oil price environments, and recent dislocation in the sector has created even more compelling opportunities for investment."
Bob Gold, Senior Managing Director said, "We appreciate the very strong level of support for Fund III from both new and existing investors, which underscores Ridgewood's success to date, as well as our robust project pipeline." 
Robert Swanson, Ridgewood Energy's Founder and Chairman said, "The success of our strategy is driven by the discipline and rigor with which our outstanding team of industry professionals executes every phase of investment.  We look forward to continuing to deliver on Ridgewood's deepwater oil strategy with Fund III." 
Ridgewood Energy's latest fund follows Ridgewood Energy Oil & Gas Fund II, L.P ("Fund II"), which closed on $1.1 billion in early 2014. The firm also manages substantial capital and commitments for investment in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on behalf of Riverstone Holdings, LLC, which has invested alongside Ridgewood Energy's funds since 2010.
Eaton Partners, LLC, based in Rowayton, CT, acted as placement agent for the fund.  Vinson & Elkins LLP, served as fund counsel.
