(1) Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this offering.  
    The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity.


We expect to face strong competition from well-established companies and small 
independent companies like our self that may result in price reductions and 
decreased demand for our flavoured yogurts.  We will be at a competitive 
disadvantage in obtaining the facilities, employees, financing and other 
resources required to provide yogurt demanded by prospective customers. Our 
opportunity to obtain customers may be limited by our financial resources and 
other assets.  We expect to be less able than our larger competitors to cope 
with generally increasing costs and expenses of doing business.


Company Description
Sipup Corporation was incorporated on October 31, 2012, under the laws of the 
State of Nevada, for the purpose of producing, packing and selling flavoured 
yogurts.   

We are in the early stages of developing our business, which is to produce, 
pack and sell flavoured yogurts.  Our plan of


 operations over the 12 month 
period following successful completion of our offering of $50,000 is to use 
(1) $7,000 to open and set up a small office and warehouse, (2) $5,000 to 
purchase ingredients and supplies (eg. Yogurt containers and non-tampered 
lids, (3) $8,000 to purchase used or lease out cheap machinery (eg. Heat seal 
liner and heating pads) (4) $10,000 to pay a salary to Rashid Naeem, our 
President and sole director, (5) $10,000 for legal and accounting fees and 
(6) $10,000 for costs associated with being a “reporting issuer” under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

----------

We intend to produce, pack, and sell our flavoured yogurts and market them. We 
have contacted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the product 
labelling procedure, and registration requirement of our manufacturing 
facility. We have not registered our facility with FDA as we will once we 
setup our office and warehouse.  We plan to have our flavoured yogurts shelved 
and refrigerated at local grocery stores and at bigger retailers and 
wholesalers. 

As we will be new in the business we will require full payments from our 
customers prior to releasing our flavoured yogurts.  Potential customers will 
have two options to pay: by wire transfer or by sending a check/money order.  
Our customers will be responsible to cover the transporting costs for bigger 
quantities, as we will not be able to transport products in big quantity.  We 
plan to purchase or lease out delivery vehicles once we start making revenue. 
Once the customer becomes a regular client we will take a partial deposit to 
have our product released at our own expense and risk.  

----------

The Company’s principal offices are located at Willy-Brandt-Anlage 20, 64823 
Gross Umstadt, Germany. Our telephone number is +49-1521-4984-548.  Our website
