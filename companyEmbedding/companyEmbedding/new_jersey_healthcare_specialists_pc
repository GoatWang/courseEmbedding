Anesthesiology

				An anesthesiologist is trained to provide pain relief and maintenance, or restoration, of a stable condition during and immediately following an operation or an obstetric or diagnostic procedure. The anesthesiologist assesses the risk of the patient undergoing surgery and optimizes the patient's condition prior to, during and after surgery. In addition to these management responsibilities, the anesthesiologist provides medical management and consultation in pain management and critical care medicine. Anesthesiologists diagnose and treat acute, long-standing and cancer pain problems; diagnose and treat patients with critical illnesses or severe injuries; direct resuscitation in the care of patients with cardiac or respiratory emergencies, including the need for artificial ventilation; and supervise post-anesthesia recovery.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

										 Horrible practice. Terrible office management. The way they conduct themselves when billing a patient that is unaware is horrible. I did not know that I had a bill until we received a certified letter in the mail threatening us with a lawsuit this is absolutely horrible. They hire a third-party debt collector/attorney at law to do their dirty work. How about you just except what my insurance paid you.

										Review for
										
NEW JERSEY HEALTHCARE SPECIALISTS PC										


										Similar experience to those previously posted,  I had no clue who this doctor was nor that the insurance had not paid the bill until I got notice that a lawsuit had been filed by some 3rd tier law firm.   The entire thing was a small amount . . .but I've never seen anyone file a law suit for $100.  But then, I've never seen an attorney who works for the $33 in fees that got tacked on. I just strung the thing out and figured as long as they had the princely sum of $33 invested in their attorney . . . I'd make them earn that mail order degree. Word to the wise . . . if you have to use these hooligans . . . be forewarned.

										Review for
										
NEW JERSEY HEALTHCARE SPECIALISTS PC										


										Be warned: this entity billed me for services that were pre-approved as if they were not. They billed $2,700. When i called to inquiry as to why they didn't go through insurance they advised i can settle for $1,154. I contacted my insurance company who paid theym $1,900. They came back and still billed me for roughly $500 saying it's deductible. So what is the value of their service? the $2,700 or the $1,154? they ripped off my insurance and ripped me off as well. Horrible service, worse customer service. Know that if you go through them you will be ripped off and since they are in medical/healthcare field you cannot file a complaint against them either.

NEW JERSEY HEALTHCARE SPECIALISTS PC										


										Be warned... This group sent my bill to the right address, wrong town. I never received the bill & then filed a lawsuit where I had to pay $60 more than I originally owed them to get out of the suit. I'll never use them again... I am actually switching hospitals since this was my 3rd horrific experience with their billing department.  The anasthesiologist who did my epidural didn't get it in all the way.  He was having trouble so just told me to lay back & not to move around... Kind of hard when you are trying to birth a child. Eventually I had a c-section where I felt them cutting me because I wasn't numb enough & it was a different anesthetist & she couldn't give me any more anesthetic so I just dealt with the pain. I truly hope no one ever has to go through that. I just wanted my daughter out because her heart rate was dropping.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.
