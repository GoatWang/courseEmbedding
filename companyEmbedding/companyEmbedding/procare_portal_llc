Customer Reviews
Tracy M.Sparks, NV

 
 
 


This software has helped to run my business for almost a decade. Tuition express has been the icing on the cake. The customer service is hands down the best I have had when implementing a new program. I had my hesitations changing was was comfortable but this has exceeded my expectations. I truly wish I would have done this sooner.

				Market Drivers			





When it comes to Compensation Management, healthcare has many issues that need to be corrected. Healthcare is primed to reform payment models but lacks tools to effectively and appropriately transform.





Simple is best except when it's not...

Organizations use less than ideal comp models because complex ones are too hard to calculate  and assumed to be error prone. What they fail to take into consideration is that even the simplest  of models can be error prone. 



You got it, no you got it, no...

Payers think the system will deal with it, systems 
        think the payers will, and the providers just know 
        they are in for it. Providers and systems need tools
        that can drive and control these changes because
        no one else is going to do it for them 



It's not about money..., It is about money

The best way to incentivize change is to link it
        directly to compensation. This way there are no
        conflicting motives - i.e., getting paid for production
        but going to meetings and being “required” to
        improve quality. 



Lagging Again

All other industries use software to manage
        compensation while healthcare’s is the most 
        complex and still uses primarily excel

Lack of Trust / Lack of Transparency

Providers do not get compensation data presented
        to them frequently enough or in the proper level of
        detail for them to trust it



Efficiency 

Deal due diligence, compensation planning/
        contract negotiations are all time consuming and 
        difficult to model

Only getting worse (or better)

More complex models with more issues; bundled
        payments are approaching and no system exists 
        to store, adjudicate and model those relationships



They’re h-e-r-e

The models to improve health outcome are being
        created but nothing else is being done to relate
        those deals to providers
