I have known Manoj Miranda for more than 6 years now.
I first met Manoj as a banker for Dental Corp Limited where I was a director during that time I found Manoj to be more than a banker he was an active participant with the company giving advise on all banking matters. He was also one of the key players in arranging a Syndicated loan with a number of Australian banks . The Debt facility was $170 Million.
Since my time at Dental Corp and beyond Manoj has remained my banker in a business capacity and also personably. He has arranged personal Mortgage finance for me as well as a number of loans for business including leases.
In addition to the above Manoj was also instrumental in working with me on a deal to buy a distribution company in Melbourne. He was key in his advise as to both how to fund the transaction and how we could structure a debt equity deal with the bank. His knowledge of both finance and credit was impeccable in this situation.
I have also introduced Manoj to a number of other deals some which where complex in most cases he was able to steer the clients in the right direction to succeed with their debt finance.
Having said the above Manoj has shown me that he is prepared to give the facts straight if there is no deal then he will state that clearly and if there is a deal his experience and knowledge can direct in the best way to move forward. He is experienced a straight shooter and has good business knowledge and ethics.
NICK THLIVERIS | DIRECTOR
								SOUTHERN CROSS DIAGNOSTICS P/L

I was referred to Manoj in 2013 by a senior banking officer on a deal that the banks had trouble supporting. Manoj was able to structure the facility and we were successful in completing the transaction.
I have found Manoj's knowledge, understanding and insight into business and bank outstanding. His ability far surpasses everyone I have met in banking and business.
This ability with his calmness, confidence and his warm, generous nature made this process and establishing other facilities seamless.
Manoj is an absolute pleasure to work with and he is the epitome of concept of being my business banking partner in my businesses.
Martin Cominotto
                                Past owner: Martin's Chemist, St Marys
                                Director: Seating Matters Australia (www.seatingmatters.com) 

Having worked with Manoj for a number of transactions, I highly recommend his services.
Manoj instantly understood my business and what we wanted to do. His experience and understanding made communicating our aims and putting together our banking facilities simple and painless. Manoj can see the big picture and then finds the most efficient way to achieve the outcome.
We were able to get on with running our business with complete confidence that Manoj was looking after our best interests and getting things done. His ability to problem solve and push through any delays was remarkable. Manoj is hard working and a pleasure to deal with.

Abstract
Innovation in health care requires new ideas and the capital to develop and commercialize those ideas into products or services.
                     The necessary capital is often “venture capital,” but the link between public policy and the venture capital industry has
                     not been well examined. In this paper we explore the link between venture capital and innovation in health care, and we present
                     new descriptive data from a survey of health care venture capital fund managers. Respondents generally viewed policy levers
                     (for example, reimbursement and regulations) as important risks to venture capital investments, potentially affecting their
                     ability to raise capital for early-stage investment funds.
                  



The amount of venture capital dollars in health care may be viewed as a proxy for the amount and type of innovation being
                        supported.
                     


Medical advancement through research and development in prescription drugs, devices, and services has had a dramatic impact on health care in
                  the United States. Innovation has shifted surgical procedures from highly to minimally invasive, moved therapies from late-stage
                  treatment to early treatment and prevention, and created treatments for previously incurable diseases.1 The growing burden of disease in the United States and worldwide suggests that the need for innovation will remain high.
               
Innovation in health care requires new ideas and the capital to develop those ideas into marketable products. Increasingly,
                  innovation occurs in small, early-stage companies that rely heavily on venture capital.2 After a product reaches a certain stage of development, these small companies are frequently acquired by larger companies
                  to complete the development, production, and marketing of products.3 This is particularly the case in the pharmaceutical industry, in which larger companies look to start-up companies to supplement
                  their product pipelines.4 It has been estimated that 17.5 percent of sales from the twenty largest pharmaceutical companies in 2002 was derived from
                  in-licensed products and that this proportion would increase to 26.1 percent in 2010.5 Thus, venture capital funds play a critical role in providing early-stage financing to bring technologies past the financial
                  “valley of death,” to the point at which they become attractive to a wider spectrum of investors, including larger pharmaceutical
                  companies and even the public through initial public offerings (IPOs).6
The positive impact of venture capital funding on innovation can be dramatic.7 Venture capital is a large source of financing for developing new ideas into health care products (more than $10 billion
                  in 2007 alone).8 One dollar of venture capital is about three times more effective in producing patentable ideas than a dollar spent on traditional
                  corporate research and development (R&D).9 Because the health sector is unique in the sheer volume and magnitude of risks facing companies (regulatory, reimbursement,
                  liability, and so on), changes in policy-induced risk can be expected to affect both the ability of fund managers to raise
                  capital and the types of health care investments made once the money is raised. However, the research literature has largely
                  not evaluated the link between public policy and venture capital. To our knowledge, no previous studies have explored the
                  perceptions of venture capital fund managers and the ways in which policy changes affect their ability to raise funds for
                  investments in early-stage life sciences companies.
               
Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to describe the health care venture capital industry and its impact on health care
                  innovation; to describe current venture capital flows across the major health sectors of devices, biotechnology, and services;
                  and to explore the perceptions and experiences of venture capital fund managers to identify the risks and drivers of health
                  care venture capital investment.

Exploring Venture Capital

What is venture capital?
Put simply, venture capital firms are institutional managers of risk capital. Typically, they invest in ideas whose developers
                        cannot access traditional forms of capital (bank or corporate funds) because of their early stage of development, and they
                        are intimately involved in the formation and governance of the start-up companies in which they invest.
                     
Before they make investments, fund managers must raise investment dollars from institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals.
                        First, they establish an investment fund with a specific investment profile. If they raise the targeted funding, they close
                        the fund and begin to invest it according to the criteria they agreed upon with their investors. Investors’ dollars remain
                        in the fund until the investments are liquidated, sometimes more than a decade later. Once a fund has been fully committed
                        (that is, invested in start-up companies), fund managers often raise capital for a sequential fund and repeat the process.
                     
Venture capital investments are illiquid and inherently risky; the companies are privately held, have few tangible assets,
                        and typically require five to eight years to reach the stage where a “liquidity event” or “exit,” such as an IPO or acquisition
                        by another company, will be feasible. According to the National Venture Capital Association, only 14 percent of funded companies
                        ever go public, and another 33 percent are acquired. The rest (53 percent) either publicly announce their failure or quietly
                        disappear.10
In exchange for significant risk, venture capital investors expect significant returns. The latest industry data show an average
                        net internal rate of return of 17.9 percent annually over the past ten years.11 To achieve a result of this size, a subset of investments within a fund must have returns much greater than average to make
                        up for the many expected failures.
                     


Impact of venture capital on innovation and the economy.
Because of the private status of most start-ups and venture capital firms, information on the venture capital industry is
                        difficult to obtain. Proprietary databases track some industry statistics such as deal flow, but finding data on returns from
                        individual investments, let alone calculating the societal benefit from them, is a challenge. However, anecdotal evidence
                        is strong.12 Also, some studies suggest that there is a dramatic impact. For example, one study revealed that whereas the ratio of venture
                        capital investment to overall industrial R&D spending was less than 3 percent, venture capital accounted for 15 percent of
                        industrial innovations as measured through patent filings.13
Venture capital–backed companies start small but do not always stay small. Some of the largest U.S. companies were backed
                        by venture capital, including blue-chip companies such as Home Depot, Starbucks, Google, Microsoft, Medtronic, and Genentech.
                        In 2006, sales of venture capital–backed firms amounted to $2.3 trillion, or 17.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).14 In the same year, 9 percent of all private jobs in the United States (more than 10 million in total) were in venture capital–backed
                        companies, and job growth in these firms during 2003–2006 was 3.6 percent, compared with overall private-sector growth of
                        1.7 percent.15 Furthermore, 83 percent of employees in the medical device sector in 2006 worked for venture capital–backed companies.16


Trends in venture capital spending.
Venture capital under management in the United States at the end of 2007 amounted to $257 billion, and investments made in
                        that year reached $30 billion—the fourth annual increase in a row, but still less than a third of the $100 billion reached
                        in 2000, the peak bubble year.17 In 2007 an estimated 741 venture capital firms were operating in the United States, each of which ran an average of two separate
                        funds. About one-third of the firms actively raised money in 2007, leading to almost $40 billion in capital raised.18


Venture capital in health care.
Health care has been a major focus of the venture capital industry in recent years, representing 31 percent of total venture
                        capital investments in 2007.19 For analysis purposes, the health care industry can be split into three general sectors: (1) pharmaceutical and biotechnology
                        products; (2) devices (for example, pacemakers, stents, glucose monitors); and (3) services (for example, home health care,
                        back-office services, and other), with the lion’s share of investment targeting products and devices.
                     
The medical device sector is of particular interest because it has seen dramatic increases in absolute investment and increased
                        market share within health care, reaching 45 percent in 2007, as compared to 35 percent in 2004 (Exhibit 1⇓).20 In 2007 the largest single area of medical device investment was surgical instruments and equipment—$844 million, or 20.4
                        percent of the total $4.1 billion invested in devices. The rest was split between therapeutic devices (including defibrillators),
                        diagnostics, and other items.21 Biotechnology investment, on the other hand, is fragmented; no single product category accounted for more than 12 percent
                        of the total $5.2 billion invested in the product sector. Investments in services are more homogeneous, with almost half of
                        the investments in 2007 ($117 million out of $249 million) being focused on long-term, home, and elder care.22

Descriptive Survey Of Venture Capital Fund Managers
Despite venture capital’s importance in financing early-stage companies that are critical to technological innovation in health
                     care, little is known about the impact of public policy on managers’ ability to raise funds. Thus, we created a survey targeting
                     venture capital fund managers to begin to explore these issues.23
The survey was designed to address the following issues: (1) how the firm’s money was invested and how such investments have
                     changed over time; (2) the fund manager’s perceptions of the greatest risks both to the success of the portfolio companies
                     and to the firm’s ability to raise capital; (3) how changes in reimbursement and regulatory risks might affect venture capital
                     fund flows; and (4) how risk-return profiles vary across the health care investment sectors.
                  
Twenty fund managers met the inclusion criteria and completed the survey. Although these numbers are not sufficient to generate
                     statistically significant results, the collective opinions of the respondents provide important insights. The respondents
                     averaged 12.4 years of experience in the venture capital industry (range, 1–30 years), and their funds had invested in more
                     than 1,100 companies, with more than $13.5 billion currently under management, $7.0 billion of which was devoted to health
                     care. The distribution of investments across health care sectors in respondents’ portfolios is consistent with national data,
                     and respondents reported increasing their investments in medical devices, also consistent with the national trend. Given the
                     lack of previous documentation of fund managers’ perceptions and values, the survey results provide a useful starting point
                     for discussion and further evaluation.
                  

Ability to raise capital.
Fund managers were asked to rate the importance to their investors of several factors (Exhibit 2⇓). Their responses were not unexpected. All but one considered the potential return given the risk of the portfolio as a factor
                        that either mattered “very much” or was “all that mattered.” Other important factors in raising health care funds were the
                        experience of the management team in the portfolio company (sixteen of twenty) and the novelty of the technology or service
                        (fourteen of twenty). All other factors (including public health impact) were less important: 70 percent or more of the respondents
                        considered them only moderately important or less.

EXHIBIT 2 
Factors That Are Important To Investors When Deciding Whether To Invest In Health Care



Of the three most important factors affecting the ability to raise capital, the risk-return profile is the only factor that
                        can be affected by changes in regulatory and reimbursement policies. Respondents largely agreed on the importance of the relationship
                        between returns and regulatory and reimbursement policies, ranking reimbursement, intellectual property (IP) protection, and
                        the efficiency of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review process as the most important risks affecting portfolio companies’
                        returns.
                     


Medical devices versus biotech and drug products.
Data from the venture capital industry showing steady increases in the absolute and relative magnitude of investments in the
                        device sector might reasonably be interpreted as demonstrating the relative attractiveness of this sector, compared to biotechnology
                        or other sectors, as a result of factors such as lower development costs, shorter development times, and reduced regulatory
                        hurdles.24 The results of the survey support this interpretation. Respondents were asked to rate the three sectors by risk-return ratio.
                        Unlike the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals markets—which all respondents viewed as high risk—the device market yielded a
                        variety of opinions, including a quarter of managers who felt that the device market yielded high returns with low risks—an
                        ideal combination, if truly achievable.
                     
Respondents were also asked to rank a series of risks to the success of their portfolio companies. Investors who focused on
                        the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets ranked the efficiency of the FDA review process as the most important risk to
                        their portfolio companies; they were less concerned with reimbursement. This is to be expected, given the longer development
                        times and higher regulatory hurdles facing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products compared to medical devices and the targeted
                        exit strategy of acquisition for many of these firms.25 Conversely, device-focused firms were more concerned about reimbursement than about the FDA review process. This finding
                        may reflect the relatively rapid FDA processes for devices and, thus, the relative importance of reimbursement to the early
                        stages of the device business model.
                     


IP protection and product liability.
IP protection and product liability are two areas of potential risk to companies, but respondents’ views of their relative
                        importance were divergent. IP protection was the third-ranked risk (after reimbursement and FDA processes). On the other hand,
                        product liability did not elicit much concern, despite recent high-profile challenges to large companies (for example, Merck
                        and Vioxx).26
Concern about IP protection is not surprising, given both the IP output of venture-backed companies and, because of the size
                        of the companies, their reliance on patent protection to maintain barriers to market entry by competitors. Venture capital
                        fund managers may also view this area as important because of recent uncertainty regarding the future of IP protection in
                        the United States.27 Conversely, product liability was not considered an important risk, which may reflect the early-to-mid-stage nature of venture
                        capital investments, with venture funds typically exiting before liability issues can become a concern.
                     


Sensitivity to changes in risk.
The survey suggests that an increase in risk (specifically, regulatory and reimbursement risk) has a major impact on the investment
                        strategies of venture capital funds. Approximately two-thirds of respondents said that increases in risk would lead them to
                        shift investments within or across health care sectors or to reduce health care investments altogether. Although the survey
                        did not attempt to quantify the relationship between variations in risk and changes in investment strategy, these findings
                        are worthy of reflection. Of the $67 billion invested in health care by venture capital firms since 2000, less than 20 percent
                        was invested by firms focused on health care (that is, “pure-play” firms).28 Because most investments are being made by non-pure-play firms, the scope for shifting out of health care investment and
                        into other areas is large. Furthermore, the scope for shifting investments within health care (including from areas of high
                        to low public health impact) remains high. As one respondent wrote, “Regulatory risk is a primary consideration when considering
                        potential investments. Generally, it decreases the chance that an investment will be made in a ‘new area’ and increases the
                        chance an investment will be made in a ‘me-too’ space.” Investors “want big exits,” wrote another respondent. “Lower reimbursement
                        lowers the ultimate exit value of individual portfolio companies. Investors who want to stay in health care will shift investments
                        from life saving products…to consumer-pay cosmetic opportunities. …That trend has already started in anticipation of decreased
                        reimbursement.”
                     
These two comments reveal both a level of concern about reimbursement and regulatory risk and a degree of freedom for managers
                        to shift investments within the health care sector to maximize returns. Unfortunately, these risk-mitigation strategies could
                        result in a lower net public benefit from venture capital–backed technologies.
                     
Looking forward, the picture does not look any brighter for the venture capital industry. When managers were asked how they
                        saw reimbursement risk changing in the future, none thought that it would improve.
                     


Business model for public health.
In examining the link between venture capital, health care policy, and public health benefit, it is helpful to recognize that
                        the supply of venture capital investment can be affected by poor public policy throughout the investment cycle. Once a venture
                        capital firm makes a given investment in a start-up company, funds are typically locked in for a number of years. However,
                        investment decisions for the uncommitted portion of the funds are fluid, and changes in federal policies could have a major
                        effect even in the short term. Moreover, venture capital firms tap the capital markets regularly to raise new funds for investments
                        in sectors that are deemed attractive at that time. Thus, venture capital firms may respond to perceived unfavorable policies
                        either by adjusting their strategies to lower-risk investments within the health care sector (with possibly lower societal
                        benefits) or by leaving the sector altogether in the ensuing round of fund-raising.
                     
The ease with which venture capital firms change strategy and behavior (particularly away from risky areas that might have
                        the greatest potential to improve public health) is not unexpected. Fund managers perceived that their investors consider
                        financial returns to be their primary concern and that the public health benefit of their investments is of little importance.
                        Thus, policymakers should not lose sight of the fact, self-evident to some, that private-sector innovations designed to improve
                        public health require business models that make them financially viable and provide attractive returns on investment.29
One good example of a public policy decision that recognized this important dynamic and implemented a solution that aligned
                        business and public health interests was the Pediatric Exclusivity Provision of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997.30 Given a dearth of clinical trials that examined the safety of drugs in children, Congress granted six months of market-exclusivity
                        extensions to companies that conducted pediatric safety studies for those products. Despite some debate about whether six
                        months of exclusivity was too generous, this policy has increased the number of pediatric trials.31 In 2007, Congress extended the program for another five years.32
Examining the interplay between policy and health care venture capital reveals a need to further explore and monitor the interdependencies
                        among policy, industry, and the public interest. One solution might be to systematically collect data from the venture capital
                        community (whether it be opinion data or investment strategy data, as laid out in fund-raising documents) to understand their
                        perceptions of public policy and its contribution to investment risk, the types of investments new funds will consider, and
                        the success of health care funds in raising new investment dollars. These data can provide valuable insight into early barriers
                        to innovation (much as the FDA’s Critical Path Initiative examined this issue from the perspective of downstream users of
                        the regulatory process).33
In short, the public health returns from venture capital investment are both fluid and sensitive to public policy risk. Thus,
                        policy-makers (and the public they serve) may benefit from a system that monitors the impact of policy on the venture capital
                        industry’s ability to invest in technologies that can improve health and health care.

Concluding Comments
Innovative ideas in health care can come from many places, and their creators often turn to venture capital to turn those
                     ideas into biotechnology or pharmaceutical products, medical devices, or health care services. This is particularly the case
                     as more large drug and device companies look to smaller start-up companies to help fill their product pipelines.34 Thus, the amount of venture capital dollars in health care may be viewed as a partial proxy for the amount and type of innovation
                     being supported. Protecting a vibrant venture capital sector is an important means of stimulating innovative health care delivery.
                     Federal policies can have a direct impact on the risks and returns of venture capital investments. They can also affect both
                     the ability of the venture capital industry to raise capital for investments in health care and how that money is invested
                     once raised. Therefore, given venture capital’s important contributions to innovation in health care, policymakers should
                     make a concerted effort to better understand the link between their policy levers and the venture capital industry.

The impact of the venture capital industry is hard to ignore. Venture capital–funded information technology companies such
                              as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Intel, and eBay have transformed the U.S. and global economies. Some of the more innovative recent
                              technologies in the health sector have been financed by venture capital, from home glucose self-monitoring devices to drugs
                              such as trastuzumab (Herceptin). See additional examples in Platzer, “Patient Capital.”
