Pura Naturals Releases Statement Regarding Planned Growth




May 25, 2017





FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Pura Naturals Releases Statement Regarding Planned Growth 
Pura Naturals has been in a transitional phase and is now aligned to meet the demands of today's connected consumer
Lake Forest, California – May 24, 2017
At Pura Naturals Inc., we have listened to our investors and are making several changes to improve financial performance and position the Pura brand among the leading competitors in our industry.  Over the first two quarters of this year, we have taken steps to (1) re-focus to a Direct-to-Consumer model, 2) significantly transition our marketing and branding efforts to digital media, (3) address working capital deficiencies, and (4) augment our leadership team with proven sales and marketing strategists.
Re-Focus on a Direct-to-Consumer Model
First, we are creating a marketing and sales distribution model that fits the modern, connected consumer. In the past, we thought simply acquiring shelf space at several high volume retail stores would sell our products. However, this strategy has proved insufficient to reach our sales and revenue goals. Without substantial and sustained digital brand and marketing campaigns, we are unlikely to meet our sales and revenue goals.
Derek Duhame, the new President of Pura Naturals, commented "Moving forward, Pura will be more aligned with and dedicated to relevant and impactful marketing and sales strategies. The changes that have taken place over the last two quarters and those planned for this quarter involve tactics and strategies to engage consumers, build brand awareness, increase sales and profitability, and improve financial performance for our investors."
We have reevaluated our distribution channels while examining and preparing for a more effective and efficient strategic model to grow sales and increase shareholder value. Following this strategy, we will integrate a direct to consumer model into our existing distribution channels that will incorporate digital marketing and media to promote our products directly to the customers most likely to buy them. To this end, we have separated and defined our products by product line for better market segmentation. In addition, we are rebranding several products in our Home and Health & Beauty lines to highlight the specific benefits they provide. Furthermore, to build our brand, we have engaged several strategic marketing partners with proven expertise in creating brand awareness, product positioning and consumer engagement strategies and tactics.  We think the foregoing strategies will increase overall sales, build our brand awareness, increase our profit margins, and earnings per share.
E-Commerce and Digital Marketing
Second, following our new focus on the Direct-to-Consumer model, we have launched or will be launching three new websites that enable consumers to directly purchase our innovative and eco-friendly products online.
On April 25, we launched a new e-commerce website for our popular Pura Marine products.  During recent tradeshows, our Pura Marine products generated significant interest in both the recreational watercraft and the industrial oil transportation industries. We were pleased to receive several new commercial orders for our marine products following the tradeshows and website launch.
Following this model, we plan to launch two more e-commerce sites in June.  We will market and sell our newly-rebranded "Pura Clean" Total Home cleaning products through the new "Pura Clean Club" ecommerce website, and sell our Health & Beauty products through "PuraCleanse Club."  Our PuraCleanse Club website will introduce two brand new results-focused products:  the new "PuraCleanse 3-in-1 Body Bars" and "PuraCleanse 3-in-1 Facial System".
All of our new e-commerce sites will incorporate modern digital and social media marketing strategies, including Facebook advertising campaigns.  We believe these bold initiatives will increase our brand awareness, profitability, and sales revenues.
Working Capital
Third, to address our working capital needs as we implement the foregoing strategies, we have identified several potential significant sources of capital and funding partners. We believe that access to more capital will assist us to implement the e-commerce model and increase revenues through targeted digital media marketing campaigns.
Management Team
Finally, we have re-structured our management team, adding executive talent that we believe will help us meet our sales and profitability goals.  During the first quarter 2017, we hired Derek Duhame, an experienced executive with a proven record of generating product sales and increasing profitability, as our President. Mr. Duhame has helped create our new marketing vision and will lead its implementation.  We also hired Daniel Kryger as our Vice President of Business Development.
Chairman Robert Doherty has also named both Daniel Kryger and Derek Duhame to our Board of Directors.

Patent Pending for Oil and Hydrocarbon Filtration




May 15, 2017



 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Patent Pending for Oil and Hydrocarbon Filtration  
Pura Naturals, Inc. filed a Patent Application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for its revolutionary Scupper Plug
 
Lake Forest, California – May 15, 2017
Pura Naturals Inc. (OTCMarkets.com Ticker: PNAT), using its BeBetterFoam®, has designed a unique filtration device for closed orifices and scuppers, and has now filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark office. The new “Scupper Plug” product is used primarily for the marine industry but has many other applications as well. The Scupper Plug, sold under the Pura Marine division of Pura Naturals, allows water to freely flow through any orifice but remediates and collects the oils that tend to create problems in drainage situations, which are most often found on oil transport vessels, barges, tug boats, recreational boats, and even in swimming pools. The Scupper Plug device has far-reaching opportunities for any drainage pipe or opening where a water solution also has a hydrocarbon bearing solution.   The device saves our environment in a practical way, unlike anything else. This device will solidly protect the environment and at the same time address and diminish exposure to pollution fines and penalties for the customers who put it to use.  The overall economic benefit to the customer is expected to be very significant.
 Bob Doherty, CEO, stated: "We are excited about the vast possibilities of this product. A more practical need exists within the marine petroleum transport vessels industry to control the oil residue from the transfer pumps and barge surfaces on those vessels.  Various industries will benefit from this technology which will capture the contaminants we don’t want in our waterways and leave clear water to freely pass through.” 
 Along with its broad reaching uses, the Scupper Plug is designed to be reusable. Pura Naturals, Inc. is an EarthConscious® company committed to creating better products for a better planet, which includes products that are natural, renewable, and reusable.

Pura Naturals Releases Statement Regarding Planned Growth




May 25, 2017





FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Pura Naturals Releases Statement Regarding Planned Growth 
Pura Naturals has been in a transitional phase and is now aligned to meet the demands of today's connected consumer
Lake Forest, California – May 24, 2017
At Pura Naturals Inc., we have listened to our investors and are making several changes to improve financial performance and position the Pura brand among the leading competitors in our industry.  Over the first two quarters of this year, we have taken steps to (1) re-focus to a Direct-to-Consumer model, 2) significantly transition our marketing and branding efforts to digital media, (3) address working capital deficiencies, and (4) augment our leadership team with proven sales and marketing strategists.
Re-Focus on a Direct-to-Consumer Model
First, we are creating a marketing and sales distribution model that fits the modern, connected consumer. In the past, we thought simply acquiring shelf space at several high volume retail stores would sell our products. However, this strategy has proved insufficient to reach our sales and revenue goals. Without substantial and sustained digital brand and marketing campaigns, we are unlikely to meet our sales and revenue goals.
Derek Duhame, the new President of Pura Naturals, commented "Moving forward, Pura will be more aligned with and dedicated to relevant and impactful marketing and sales strategies. The changes that have taken place over the last two quarters and those planned for this quarter involve tactics and strategies to engage consumers, build brand awareness, increase sales and profitability, and improve financial performance for our investors."
We have reevaluated our distribution channels while examining and preparing for a more effective and efficient strategic model to grow sales and increase shareholder value. Following this strategy, we will integrate a direct to consumer model into our existing distribution channels that will incorporate digital marketing and media to promote our products directly to the customers most likely to buy them. To this end, we have separated and defined our products by product line for better market segmentation. In addition, we are rebranding several products in our Home and Health & Beauty lines to highlight the specific benefits they provide. Furthermore, to build our brand, we have engaged several strategic marketing partners with proven expertise in creating brand awareness, product positioning and consumer engagement strategies and tactics.  We think the foregoing strategies will increase overall sales, build our brand awareness, increase our profit margins, and earnings per share.
E-Commerce and Digital Marketing
Second, following our new focus on the Direct-to-Consumer model, we have launched or will be launching three new websites that enable consumers to directly purchase our innovative and eco-friendly products online.
On April 25, we launched a new e-commerce website for our popular Pura Marine products.  During recent tradeshows, our Pura Marine products generated significant interest in both the recreational watercraft and the industrial oil transportation industries. We were pleased to receive several new commercial orders for our marine products following the tradeshows and website launch.
Following this model, we plan to launch two more e-commerce sites in June.  We will market and sell our newly-rebranded "Pura Clean" Total Home cleaning products through the new "Pura Clean Club" ecommerce website, and sell our Health & Beauty products through "PuraCleanse Club."  Our PuraCleanse Club website will introduce two brand new results-focused products:  the new "PuraCleanse 3-in-1 Body Bars" and "PuraCleanse 3-in-1 Facial System".
All of our new e-commerce sites will incorporate modern digital and social media marketing strategies, including Facebook advertising campaigns.  We believe these bold initiatives will increase our brand awareness, profitability, and sales revenues.
Working Capital
Third, to address our working capital needs as we implement the foregoing strategies, we have identified several potential significant sources of capital and funding partners. We believe that access to more capital will assist us to implement the e-commerce model and increase revenues through targeted digital media marketing campaigns.
Management Team
Finally, we have re-structured our management team, adding executive talent that we believe will help us meet our sales and profitability goals.  During the first quarter 2017, we hired Derek Duhame, an experienced executive with a proven record of generating product sales and increasing profitability, as our President. Mr. Duhame has helped create our new marketing vision and will lead its implementation.  We also hired Daniel Kryger as our Vice President of Business Development.
Chairman Robert Doherty has also named both Daniel Kryger and Derek Duhame to our Board of Directors.

Patent Pending for Oil and Hydrocarbon Filtration




May 15, 2017



 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Patent Pending for Oil and Hydrocarbon Filtration  
Pura Naturals, Inc. filed a Patent Application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for its revolutionary Scupper Plug
 
Lake Forest, California – May 15, 2017
Pura Naturals Inc. (OTCMarkets.com Ticker: PNAT), using its BeBetterFoam®, has designed a unique filtration device for closed orifices and scuppers, and has now filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark office. The new “Scupper Plug” product is used primarily for the marine industry but has many other applications as well. The Scupper Plug, sold under the Pura Marine division of Pura Naturals, allows water to freely flow through any orifice but remediates and collects the oils that tend to create problems in drainage situations, which are most often found on oil transport vessels, barges, tug boats, recreational boats, and even in swimming pools. The Scupper Plug device has far-reaching opportunities for any drainage pipe or opening where a water solution also has a hydrocarbon bearing solution.   The device saves our environment in a practical way, unlike anything else. This device will solidly protect the environment and at the same time address and diminish exposure to pollution fines and penalties for the customers who put it to use.  The overall economic benefit to the customer is expected to be very significant.
 Bob Doherty, CEO, stated: "We are excited about the vast possibilities of this product. A more practical need exists within the marine petroleum transport vessels industry to control the oil residue from the transfer pumps and barge surfaces on those vessels.  Various industries will benefit from this technology which will capture the contaminants we don’t want in our waterways and leave clear water to freely pass through.” 
 Along with its broad reaching uses, the Scupper Plug is designed to be reusable. Pura Naturals, Inc. is an EarthConscious® company committed to creating better products for a better planet, which includes products that are natural, renewable, and reusable.

LAKE FOREST, Calif., May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Pura Naturals, Inc.'s (OTCMarkets.com Ticker: PNAT) Board of Directors has approved the acquisition of the foam formulas and related intellectual property rights from Advanced Innovative Recovery Technologies, Inc. (AIRTech) under the license agreement between the parties.  The transaction, also approved by the Board of Directors for AIRTech, eliminates more than $800,000 in existing Pura Naturals debt obligations in exchange for stock.








CEO Robert Doherty stated, "Purchasing the formulas reduces our reliance on AIRTech and now AIRTech supports Pura as a contract manufacturer.  Ownership of the formulas enhances Pura's value in the marketplace and strengthens the competitive position Pura has already gained among the largest consumer brands."
In addition to the new ownership of the product formulas, Pura Naturals' intellectual property portfolio consists of one (1) patent pending and one (1) patent in the application stage, six (6) registered trademarks and eight (8) pending trademarks.
About Pura Naturals
Pura Naturals has a household cleaning product that absorbs grease and grime while delivering unique soap infusion without harmful chemicals or the bacteria buildup common with typical sponge products. Pura Naturals' foam technology was developed in response to the gulf oil spill. The revolutionary foam absorbs grease while repelling water and inhibiting bacteria growth and odors. The earth conscious company prides itself on its plant-based products made from renewable resources with no petroleum by-products. Further information can be found at www.puranaturalsproducts.com

Pura Naturals Inc (OTCMKTS:PNAT) closed 2016 on the happy note with announcing product availability expansion. The company announced that it is expanding its products availability through additional distribution channels, mainly in the form of, select Target stores in the U.S.
Popular home cleaning products to more households
The company’s foam cleaning products, which are made available through proprietary foam technology, are popular among the consumers. The company’s CEO, Robert Doherty said that Pura Naturals partnership with Target will make its products available to more number of households. He added that the company products “bring better cleaning solutions to everyone.”
Ease of availability to add more number of customers
The company’s foam technology products are well marketed. By making the products available to the customers easily, Pura Naturals can expand its customer base. Ease of access to the products through Target stores across the U.S. would mean that the company is looking for expanding its customer base as well.
This would definitely mean added revenue to the company and market accessibility in new areas. Addition of new states on the list can be seen here.
A product that works on proprietary foam technology
The company claims to offer unique products for home cleaning. Its proprietary foam technology is said to magnetize grime and grease without the use of harmful chemicals or harbouring bacteria. The company says that the traditional cleaning products available in the market right now, harbour bacteria.
The company’s products reportedly work on “unique soap infusion” formula without leading to bacterial build up. This is common with the household sponge products found otherwise in the market, as claimed by Pura Naturals. The company has said to produce such household products in response to gulf oil spill.
The unique formula and technology of company, as claimed, is a result of plant-based products. The company, as the name says, make it products based on renewable resource, unlike petroleum products found traditionally in the market.

Forward looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by, or on our behalf.  We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
In some cases, you can identify forward‑looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “intend,” “expects,” “plan,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology.

Pura Naturals, Inc. ( OTCPK:PNAT) was founded in 2013. It created a partnership with Advanced Innovative Recover Technology, Inc. and created a proprietary bio-based foam trademarked as BeBetterFoam® and markets several products using this trade secret. Its unique products are manufactured from renewable resources rather than petroleum.
The company products compete in three commercial categories. 1) Health and Beauty products include activated charcoal facial pads and body bars for adults and infants, both scented and unscented. 2) Kitchen and Household products include soap infused sponges and non-scratch scrubbers, both scented and non-scented. 3) Marine Clean-up and Remediation Uses the BeBetterFoam® formula. It is a plant-based and uses a carbon negative process. Approved by the EPA and California Department of Fish and Wildlife for use in waterways, it offers a custom solution for oil spill prevention and response in the marine, oil, trucking and locomotive industries. Its claimed absorbent capacity both out matches the competition, and the product is reusable and allows the user to reclaim absorbed substances.

A bit about the technology. The company claims that BeBetterFoam® is a proprietary polymer process technology that is protected by a trade secret, and is incapable of being reverse engineered. The resulting cleaning products absorb oil, grease and grime, removes impurities from skin (cleansing and applying/removing make- up), and is latex-free. They are also non-toxic, made of renewable resources, have a carbon-negative footprint, and contain no petroleum by-products. The sponges have no adhesives or glues and are infused with soap that is 100% natural, bio-degradable, sustainable, vegan, gluten-free. The products contain botanicals and essential oils. The BeBetterFoam® is hydrophobic, which means it resists and does not support bacteria, and believed to be up to 40 times stronger than the leading kitchen sponge brand.
The markets and sells consumer and industrial products using direct sales, and through brokers and distributors to wholesalers, retail stores and the internet. In a short time it has been relatively successful in having its products placed in several well known retail outlets. These include Bed- Bath-and Beyond, select Target Stores, Whole Foods in Canada, several large retail grocery chains in the Mid-west and southeast of the US. The marine division has negotiated an arrangement with both Chevron and Harley Marine.
Now comes the more sobering news. As of its quarterly report as of September 2016, Sales for the nine months were about $324 thousand. Cost of Goods about $165 thousand for 49% Gross Margin. However, the General and Administrative Expenses ran about $875 thousand for the same period, which was a substantial decrease from the previous reporting period. The balance sheet submitted for the same period records $261 thousand in assets, with $100 thousand in accounts receivable. Liabilities are a bit more than $390 thousand. With this Current Ratio of 0.66 and cash on hand of $27 thousand, the company has a liquidity problem. Additionally, the balance sheet does not show any inventory values. This is puzzling if Pura Naturals, Inc. is the actual manufacturer of the product.
So what is the company doing about this situation. It engaged Impact Strategic Marketing Insights in November 2016. This company provides advice and guidance in areas of market research, brand development, strategic and digital and marketing. It will work closely with episode49, a creative web design, search engine optimization and digital marketing solutions firm. Both firms will be intent on developing a consumer-focused digital presence for a Pura Naturals enhanced e-commerce activity.
It moved its past president to CEO, and hired Derek Duhame as President. He is an accomplished executive with expertise and experience in driving performance, Profit and Loss oversight, multi-channel product distribution, and marketing. His experience includes developing sales strategies, partnerships, creative pricing, renewal strategies and out-of-the-box new sales initiatives. He has galvanized management and sales teams that have achieved consistent, double digit percentage revenue gains.
For the industrial side, which is only being touched, the company appointed Jeff Silver to Vice President Commercial/ Marine Sales. He has worked in manufacturing and sales, and with marine foam products for much of his career. His 20 years in the marine industry should position him to provide clients with advanced solutions using the company's products.
Pura Naturals, Inc. has unique and protected products. However, it is trying to enter a very crowded marketplace. Both the consumer and the industrial markets have many competitors and offer a challenge for any newcomer to create its space, brand its products, and recruit loyal customers. It not only requires sophistication in marketing and sales, but also in logistics and manufacturing. Often the margins are slim for the retailer, and thus the wholesaler. Therefore volume, efficiency and cost control become the name of the game. The company will need a near term infusion of cash to continue, and has demonstrated it has the skill to secure it short term. Investors will be watching closely if the recent changes in management and approach achieve the desired results.
New investors will certainly be watching. Pura Natural could be extremely successful with its "environmentally sensitive" products, to a customer base quite willing to pay a premium for this characteristic. We will see.

$PNAT Pura Naturals Acquires Product Formulas and Related Intellectual Property   May 25, 2017  OTC Disclosure & News Service   -   Pura Naturals Acquires Product Formulas and Related Intellectual Property   Board of Directors Approves Major Acquisition to Improve Pura's Competitive Position  PR Newswire   LAKE FOREST, Calif., May 25, 2017   LAKE FOREST, Calif., May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Pura Naturals, Inc.'s (OTCMarkets.com Ticker: PNAT) Board of Directors has approved the acquisition of the foam formulas and related intellectual property rights from Advanced Innovative Recovery Technologies, Inc. (AIRTech) under the license agreement between the parties.  The transaction, also approved by the Board of Directors for AIRTech, eliminates more than $800,000 in existing Pura Naturals debt obligations in exchange for stock.   Pura Naturals   CEO Robert Doherty stated, "Purchasing the formulas reduces our reliance on AIRTech and now AIRTech supports Pura as a contract manufacturer.  Ownership of the formulas enhances Pura's value in the marketplace and strengthens the competitive position Pura has already gained among the largest consumer brands."   In addition to the new ownership of the product formulas, Pura Naturals' intellectual property portfolio consists of one (1) patent pending and one (1) patent in the application stage, six (6) registered trademarks and eight (8) pending trademarks.   About Pura Naturals   Pura Naturals has a household cleaning product that absorbs grease and grime while delivering unique soap infusion without harmful chemicals or the bacteria buildup common with typical sponge products. Pura Naturals' foam technology was developed in response to the gulf oil spill. The revolutionary foam absorbs grease while repelling water and inhibiting bacteria growth and odors. The earth conscious company prides itself on its plant-based products made from renewable resources with no petroleum by-products.
