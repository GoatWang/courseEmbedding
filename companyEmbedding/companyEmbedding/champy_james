Product Description
James Champy – Reengineering Management Mandate for New Leadership

The co-author of the monumental bestseller Reengineering the Corporation continues the reengineering revolution with another national bestseller that has already sold more than 165,000 copies in hardcover
Reengineering Management is a brilliant, practical and much needed book on the most powerful management idea of the decade. Reengineering—changing the traditional and outdated organization, processes and culture of a company—is corporate America’s greatest challenge today.
In Reengineering Management, Champy examines the far-reaching changes managers must make for themselves and their companies to succeed in an era of unprecedented competition. Through his extensive consulting and research work, he shows how reengineering succeeds only when managers reinvent their own jobs and managerial styles. Otherwise, the ultra-efficient and effective reengineered processes for acquiring and serving customers, filling orders, bringing new concepts to market and other key business activities eventually fall apart.
Champy illustrates this new management agenda through first-hand experiences of managers of reengineered operations at Federal Express, Wisconsin Electric, CIGNA Health Care, Hewlett-Packard, AT&T Universal Card Services and other companies. Champy shows how they are mastering the managerial challenges of reengineering, and as a result are making their organizations exciting and competitive. As more and more organizations reengineer, the experiences of these managers will become an insiders’ guide to managerial life in the company of the future.
Reengineering Management picks up where Reengineering the Corporation left off—by exploring the managerial implications of the reengineered workplace. As reengineering becomes critical to all organizations, Reengineering Management will be the road map for managerial success in the future. It is, indeed, the manifesto for the next managerial revolution.

James Champy, in Reengineering Management:  The Mandate for New Leadership, studies the turbulent world of modern business in a follow-up work to his 1993 work Reengineering the Corporation.  In the previous work, the author presented a broader picture of corporate opportunities for more effective and efficient "operational processes---product development, for example, or order fulfillment."  In this new work, Champy focuses on the role of and requirements for management in the reengineering process. The first chapter addresses questions often raised by readers of his earlier work.  One of the purposes of this chapter is to justify another book on the subject of reengineering, and he accomplishes this end effectively.  The nature of many of these questions and his own continuing research have led him to

The entire text of the paper is shown below. However, the text is somewhat scrambled. We want to give you as much information as we possibly can about our papers and essays, but we cannot give them away for free. In the text below you will find that while disordered, many of the phrases are essentially intact. From this text you will be able to get a solid sense of the writing style, the concepts addressed, and the sources used in the research paper.


That ideal corporation is precisely whatChampy is after, in fact. In Chapter 1, Champy writes honestly that the goals of his first bookhave been only partially achieved, requiring a second book: Our earlier book was largely about reengineering work---the operational processes performed by salespeople, clerks, factory and warehouse hands, repair people, engineers, technicians, customer- service folks, field representatives. When Champyfocuses on such practical and specific examples, where the human and thebusiness coincide, his work proves most effective. His honesty and directness overcome the limitationsof his writing style. Here themore manipulative elements of the reengineering process are revealed: Reengineering begins with a strategic imperative: Anticipate--- better yet, initiate---the currents and cross currents of customer demands, needs, and wants. This is perhaps due in part to the nature of hisaudience. Champy effectively cites an example at 3M, where a renewed sense ofteamwork revitalized the electronics department. The successful manager, after all, wants to cut to the muscleof the message. In addition, the author emphasizes the point thatreengineering is a matter of humanizing the company and not merely refiningthe technical or mechanical aspects of its operations. [14]Ibid., 199. One of the purposes of this chapter is to justify anotherbook on the subject of reengineering, and he accomplishes this endeffectively. The main point Champy makes in thebook, however, is that continuing major change on every level of the modernorganization is inevitable, and managers must meet this change bravely andeagerly if they and their firms are to survive and prosper. [12]Ibid., 114. The first chapter addresses questions often raised by readers of hisearlier work. In the second chapter, for example, the "ordeal of management" isopenly acknowledged. In Chapter 8, Champy reminds the reader about a dark side toreengineering. Headdresses customer needs at length, although he hardly qualifies as a manwho puts social or moral responsibility over that economic bottom line. [2]Ibid., xii. In Chapters 4 through 6, Champy focuses on the teamwork and valuesnecessary for successful reengineering. It is crucial to reengineering because this processdepends on a sense of cooperation and community among workers at everylevel of the company. In the previous work,the author presented a broader picture of corporate opportunities for moreeffective and efficient "operational processes---product development, forexample, or order fulfillment."[1] In this new work, Champy focuses on therole of and requirements for management in the reengineering process. Champy offers suggestions for company and employeepledges with respect to the "social contract" binding the firm and itsworkers and customers into an effort to improve all related operations.The effectiveness of such pledges, Champy says, is not guaranteed, but atleast they acknowledge the significance of such human and social ideals. His first work was apparently written in the belief that suchprocesses could be limited to the non-managerial realm. Champy makes the process sound as ifit were the liberation of humanity from the chains of economic slaverywhich preceded it. Writing ofvalues, Champy differentiates between work values and social values andargues that corporate activities give individuals the opportunity toexercise and express private values in a social context which wouldotherwise remain private and personal. What keeps the reader engaged is Champy's ability to mix the humanand the economic. . This book . Therefore, Champy ismisleading in assuming, as he does in Chapter 7, that the corporation canalways effectively balance the two sets of values---economic and human. Heassumes that the reengineered corporation will flourish if it implementsstandards for workplace behavior and gets back in touch with thefundamental values upon which the firm was founded. . The leader must bring all workersinto the drive to accomplish the purpose or mission of the firm. Still, even withinthat bottom-line context, Champy does deal with the human element. Writing of downsizing, the author says that it may benecessary for efficiency and cost reduction, but it should not beimplemented without the accompanying reengineering of the firm:"Reengineering is the way to redesign work for those people remaining inthe company."[12] The fact is that, as Champy is not shy about pointing out, theprocess of reengineering a business can be painful, especially for thoseworkers (and managers) caught in the grinder of downsizing, but that painis inevitable for any business which wants to survive and thrive in thiseconomically turbulent era. Heuses the example of the CEO of Coca-Cola, who declares "constancy ofpurpose" (satisfying the customer) and "continuous discontent with theimmediate present" (always striving to improve product and service) as thetwo elements of success and progress.[9] In Chapter 4, the author focuses more tightly on leadership,specifically the need for active leadership. IsChampy suggesting that clerks and warehouse hands were buyers and readersof his first book? In this opening section on readers' questions is a courage on thepart of the author which resonates throughout the book. Therefore, he does not have to inspire his readerslyrically. His simple approach to the reader is the mosteffective. Any successful manager, after all, knows today that change isconstant, that jobs are at risk, that the future is uncertain, and thatinnovative action is required for any manager or firm which hopes tosurvive and prosper. Still, he dilutes this danger by imagining a somewhat idealcorporation: "In the wholeheartedly reengineered corporation,responsibility and authority are so widely distributed throughout theorganization that virtually everyone becomes a manager, if only of his orher own work."[5] As idealistic as such a vision is, it is nevertheless animportant part of this book. Theshortcomings of reengineering to date are not failures of the ideas ofChampy, the author says, but are rather failures of managerialaccountability. After writing of the inevitability of downsizing in manycases, for example, the author writes with an almost mystical appreciationfor the authenticity of the feelings of many effective leaders and theirability to communicate those feelings to others.[13] In Chapter 9, Champy writes again of the central importance ofeffective and honest communication at all levels of the firm, especiallywith respect to the why, what and how of the reengineering process. For example, the author deals directly andhonestly with the fact that many jobs will be lost in the reengineeringprocess, including the jobs of many managers. He deals with human resources issues with little sense of the deeper needsof human beings. Creatingcustomer demand is part of this process, obviously. Technology andthe changing role of government in business are the two major forces in thechange cycle which Champy explores. That, finally is the message of this book: Free markets need free men and women to invent the future.[15] Champy has succeeded in justifying the writing of his second book onreengineering. [4]Ibid., 3. A more realistic reader will takethe book at face value---it is aimed at helping managers improve theirbusiness, operations, production, products, services and profits. Addressing a different audience--managers--from that in hisfirst book--workers--he guides them through the reengineering process,including concrete as well as abstract aspects. Forexample, Intel's representative seems to be saying that every worker wholoses his or her job in the reengineering process has been found anotherjob with the firm,[14] which seems highly unlikely. New York: HarperBusiness, 1996.----------------------- [1]James Champy, Reengineering Management (New York: HarperBusiness,1996), 2. Managers must alsohave a vision for the future, which requires risk-taking and flexibilityand being "ambitious radicals."[3] All of this requires that managers needto balance fear and hope in themselves and throughout the corporation. This change has created a "dictatorship ofthe customariat" or a "market democracy,"[8] which no longer allows thecorporation to dictate market realities. No corporation is going to abandon its profits for the goodof society, unless it is forced to do so by the law. The leader must meet customerdemands, but he or she must also create business opportunity. [3]Ibid., xxiii. Without similardedication from below, the firm will not achieve its potential. It is about us, changing our managerial work, the way we think about, organize, inspire, deploy, enable, measure and reward the value-adding operational work.[4] Of course, the first book was written for managers as well. For thetop officers to be dedicated, Champy says, is not enough. James Champy, in Reengineering Management: The Mandate for NewLeadership, studies the turbulent world of modern business in a follow-upwork to his 1993 work Reengineering the Corporation. Chapter 12 offers a very idealistic portrait of free enterprise andthe overall effects of reengineering. [5]Ibid. by a manager. Themanager must also follow up on what he communicates, must continue to seekfeedback, and must constantly be aware of ways to improve both thereengineering and the communication about it. [15]Ibid., 2 4-2 5.----------------------- 6 In fact, Champy is naive to think that managers wouldtake steps to implement reengineering processes which would endanger theirjobs. is about managing, written for managers, and . Chapter 11 deals with additional repercussions of the reengineeringrevolution in American business and focuses additional light on thespecifics of the hiring process. [13]Ibid., 128. [7]Ibid., 8. Short-term, half-hearted, or self-protective efforts will not payoff: "Reengineering involves a voyage that will last years, possibly ourmanagement lifetime."[6] The author cannot be faulted for not challenginghis manager/readers. The manager who does notreengineer her company to compete for such savvy customers will lose out. And it's more obvious sorts of freedom, too: freedom from stifling hierarchies, from organizational "slots" and "boxes," and from the corpse of memory (which actually looks like a rusty old machine). [8]Ibid., 19. The workers were taughtthe pleasure of "delighting the customer,"[11] which translated into arenewed sense of working together, which had been lost. The problem with the book is that the values of work and societyoften clash. [1 ]Ibid., 39-4 . [9]Ibid., 38. Making a company moreeffective, more efficient, more modernized, and more productive willinevitably mean job loss in many cases. In fact, he asks them to be heroes and heroines ofthe reengineering process, which aims at "the creation of a betterworkplace and the production of wealth."[7] Champy may inspire managers to heroically implement his program inthe face of much risk and anxiety, but he does not have an inspiring style. [11]Ibid., 98. Forexample, saying the customer should be the heart of the corporation iseasy, but Champy goes on to argue that the "person in charge" is not theCEO but the person who is dealing directly with the customers, the personwho can and will actually help those customers. Whether or not heis merely trying to sell another book, he is at least writing a work whichacknowledges that the jobs of his readers in this case are at risk ifmanagers implement his suggestions. The market may be "customer-driven" as never before in history, but customers, being only human, often do not know what they demand, need, want, unless and until they see it.[1 ] Expecting from Champy a humanitarian or spiritual examination ofbusiness would be unrealistic, however. Again, the sense of community betweenworker and company is emphasized in a realistic light. For example, Champy writes that the manager of today, likeit or not, is dealing with a far more educated and skeptical customer thanwas the manager of the past. . BibliographyChampy, James. Champy is fearlessin attacking problems and dangers in the reengineering process which lesserauthors might have skirted. Reengineering Management. But many firms werefounded on the desire for profit, and the behavior of the some of the mostsuccessful businesspeople can hardly be called "good." Ruthlessness ratherthan "good behavior" often spells success in business. Perhaps some of thestories told by corporate representatives are somewhat idealized. The failure of managers to let go of their oldpower is what has prevented corporations from benefitting as fully as theymight have from previous reengineering efforts. [6]Ibid., 6. . This is especially true for the manager, Champy says,in language which always and inevitably reflects his concern for both thehuman and the economic: It's the freedom without which we can never summon the ideas and images we need to meet the demands and opportunities of our markets. Chapter 1 deals with employee hiring and is one of the morefascinating chapters. He clearly supports theprocess, emphasizing a humane approach, as well as one focused on thebottom line. The book effectively mixes the theoretical and the practical. The nature of many of these questions and his own continuingresearch have led him to bring to reengineering a tighter focus than heestablished in the first book: "I have become increasingly convinced thatthe real challenge to changing dramatically how companies operate is withmanagers, both in how they work and how they think."[2] Management hasshown a willingness to implement the steps of reengineering but has notbeen so willing to include itself in the overhaul process. In "Living the Questions," Champy emphasizes the need for bothintelligence and character in the individual reengineering the firm.

Michael Hammer and James Champy  
On Business process reengineering (BPR)
Re-engineering the corporation: A manifesto for business revolution, the book written by Michael Hammer and James A.Champy was instrumental in capturing the focus of business community towards BPR. A massive 2.5 million copies of the book were sold and the book remained on the "New York Times Best Seller list" for more than a year.     Who is Michael Hammer  Dr. Hammer is the author of four books, including the international best-seller "Reengineering the Corporation", the most important business book of the 1990s. His latest book is "The Agenda: What Every Business Must Do to Dominate the Decade". His articles have appeared in periodicals from Harvard Business Review to The Economist, and his work has been featured in every major business publication.An engineer by training, Dr. Hammer focuses on the operational nuts and bolts of business; his work is relentlessly pragmatic and immediately relevant. Dr. Hammer was formerly a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and he is a founder and director of several high technology companies. He was named by Time Magazine to its first list of America's twenty-five most influential individuals.Who is James Champy James Champy is chairman of Perot Systems Corporation’s consulting practice and also head of strategy for the company. He is responsible for providing direction and guidance to the company’s team of business and management consultants. Prior to joining Perot Systems, Mr. Champy was chairman and chief executive officer of CSC Index, the management consulting arm of Computer Sciences Corporation. He was one of the original founders of Index, a $200 million consulting practice that was acquired by CSC in 1988. Contribution of Michael Hammer and James Champy The Essence of BPR  Hammer and Champy noted that in the business environment nothing is constant or predictable—not market growth, customer demand, product life spans, technological change, nor the nature of competition. As a result, customers, competition, and change have taken on entirely new dynamics in the business world. Customers now have choice, and they expect products to be customized to their unique needs. Competition, no longer decided by "best price" alone, is driven by other factors such as quality, selection, service, and responsiveness. In addition, rapid change has diminished product and service life cycles, making the need for inventiveness and adaptability even greater. This mercurial business environment requires a switch from a task orientation to a process orientation, and it requires re-inventing how work is to be accomplished. As such, reengineering focuses on fundamental business processes as opposed to departments or organizational units. "Reengineering is the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed."—Hammer and Champy, 1993  Their Book at our bookshop Reengineering the Corporation You may also be interested in...

                           The key to reengineering is abandoning the most basic notions on which the modern organization is founded, and the authors
                              introduce the notion of process orientation, of concentrating on and rethinking end-to-end activities that create value for
                              customers

                           Today's management practices hearken back to the early 1900s, when corporations changed from owner leadership to professional
                              managers who began to run companies like controllable, predictable machines. Now that corporations have taken pains to reengineer
                              their operational processes, the management processes must change in accordance. In Reengineering Management, Champy reveals
                              that these processes must focus on mobilizing, enabling, defining, measuring, and communicating in order to achieve a business
                              culture that enables a continuous process of reengineering - in order, in short, to achieve success. For the hundreds of thousands
                              of managers who have read Reengineering the Corporation and the millions who have been touched by the reengineering revolution,
                              Reengineering Management is the book that can deliver the reality behind the promise

                              Motors that changed management practice forever, to Michael Dell's boyhood dream to have a building with a flag out front,
                              to Giuseppe Garibaldi's quest for a unified Italy, ambition comes in many guises. By turning their lens to include both heroic
                              figures of the past and today's most dynamic achievers in the worlds of business, politics, science, and the arts, Champy
                              and Nohria outline the underlying principles of ambition and how it can be channeled toward creative and enriching endeavors
                              at the personal, organizational, and even national levels. Book jacket."--BOOK JACKET

                           The co-author of the monumental bestseller Reengineering the Corporation continues the reengineering revolution with another
                              national bestseller that has already sold more than 165,000 copies in hardcover Reengineering Management is a brilliant, practical
                              and much needed book on the most powerful management idea of the decade. Reengineering'changing the traditional and outdated
                              organization, processes and culture of a company'is corporate America's greatest challenge today. In Reengineering Management,
                              Champy examines the far-reaching changes managers must make for themselves and their companies to succeed in an era of unprecedented
                              competition. Through his extensive consulting and research work, he shows how reengineering succeeds only when managers reinvent
                              their own jobs and managerial styles. Otherwise, the ultra-efficient and effective reengineered processes for acquiring and
                              serving customers, filling orders, bringing new concepts to market and other key business activities eventually fall apart.
                              Champy illustrates this new management agenda through first-hand experiences of managers of reengineered operations at Federal
                              Express, Wisconsin Electric, CIGNA Health Care, Hewlett-Packard, AT & T Universal Card Services and other companies. Champy
                              shows how they are mastering the managerial challenges of reengineering, and as a result are making their organizations exciting
                              and competitive. As more and more organizations reengineer, the experiences of these managers will become an insiders' guide
                              to managerial life in the company of the future. Reengineering Management picks up where Reengineering the Corporation left
                              off'by exploring the managerial implications of the reengineered workplace. As reengineering becomes critical to all organizations,
                              Reengineering Management will be the road map for managerial success in the future. It is, indeed, the manifesto for the next
                              managerial revolution

                           In their legendary book, Reengineering the Corporation, Jim Champy and Michael Hammer introduced businesspeople to the enormous
                              power of a revolutionary methodology called reengineering. Using reengineering, businesses around the world have systematically
                              retooled their processes - achieving dramatic cost savings, greater customer satisfaction, and more value. Now, Jim Champy
                              and Dr. Harry Greenspun show how to apply the proven reengineering methodology in health care: throughout physician practices,
                              hospitals, and even entire health systems. You'll meet innovative and visionary leaders who've been successfully reengineering
                              organizations across the entire delivery spectrum and learn powerful lessons for improving quality, reducing costs, and expanding
                              access. This book doesn't just demonstrate the immense potential of health care reengineering to revolutionize health care
                              delivery: it offers a clear roadmap for realizing that potential in your own organization

                              and managed if they are to succeed--indeed, even survive--in the 1990s and beyond."

Life and work[edit]
Champy earned his B.S. in 1963 and his M.S. in Civil Engineering in 1965 from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a J.D. degree from Boston College Law School in 1968.
Champy was chairman and chief executive officer of CSC Index, the management consulting arm of Computer Sciences Corporation. He had been one of the original founders of Index, a $200 million consulting practice that was acquired by CSC in 1988. Subsequently he was chairman of Dell Perot Systems’ (now Dell Services) consulting practice, where he was responsible for providing direction and guidance to the company’s team of business and management consultants.
Nowadays Champy consults with senior-level executives of multinational companies seeking to improve business performance. His approach centers on helping leaders achieve business results through four distinct, yet overlapping areas: business strategy, management and operations, organizational development and change, and information technology.
He is currently a Senior Research Fellow at Harvard's Advanced Leadership Initiative.[1] He is a life member of the MIT Corporation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Board of Trustees, and serves on the Board of Overseers of the Boston College Law School. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices, Inc.

Overview


Description
                      In an age that's notorious for customer disloyalty, it is still possible to make your customers "stick" to you like glue and, in an era of relentless commoditization and price pressure, it's more crucial than ever that you do. In Inspire, legendary business guru James Champy reveals exactly how to do it. Champy reveals how to define an authentic, consistent selling proposition your customers will be passionate about and will stay passionate about. He demonstrates how to engage a new generation of customers that value transparency...how to bring authenticity to everything your company does: real, honest authenticity, not the "fake" authenticity today's customers smell out and despise! Drawing on case studies from companies in traditional and "sexy" industries alike, Champy shows how to move your company forward with new products, services, and business models that reflect the best of what you really are. You'll learn how companies like Puma reinvigorated themselves in the face of brutally tough and creative competition... how to deliver value in new ways based on convenience (Zipcar)... simplicity (GoDaddy)... honesty (Honest Tea)... how to go beyond mere marketing campaigns to lead crusades customers want to join. Once again, James Champy has given businesses actionable solutions to the most challenging problem they face: making customers stick.
                    



Reviews
The Wall Street Journal Bestseller - Hardcover Business 
 
From The Wall Street Journal
 
“It is well worth forgetting financial misbehavior for a moment and recalling that great economies are built not on credit derivative swaps but on the energy of entrepreneurs. Jim Champy's short, peppy "Inspire!" contains seven stories of businesses that have thrived in the shadow of large competitors by doing what big companies so often fail to do: actually bothering to please the people who buy their products and services.” 












Features
New from James Champy: How to make your customers stick with you! 
 
Inspire a new generation of customers that demands openness, transparency, and authenticity .  
Define a unique value proposition you can use to transform your business or build a great new business.  
By the co-author of Reengineering the Corporation, the 3-million-copy bestseller that changed business!

About the Author(s)
Jim Champy is one of the leading management and business thinkers of our time. His first best seller, Reengineering the Corporation, remains the bible for executing process change. His second book, Reengineering Management, another best seller, was recognized by Business Week as one of the most important books of its time. Champy’s latest book, OUTSMART!, shows how to achieve breakthrough growth by consistently outsmarting your competition by identifying six powerful new ways to compete in even the toughest marketplace. 
 
Champy is also an experienced manager and advisor. He is currently the Chairman of Consulting for Perot Systems. He speaks and writes with the authority of real business experience and brings pragmatism to the world of business. In this new series of books, Champy looks at what’s working today for high-growth businesses. Champy observes that there is not much new in management, but there is a lot new in business--and a lot to learn from what’s new.
