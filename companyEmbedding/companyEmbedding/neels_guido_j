    REDWOOD CITY, Calif., May 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Radiant Medical, Inc., a private medical device company pioneering the development of endovascular therapeutic cooling for the treatment of heart, brain and kidney disorders, today announced that Guido J. Neels, recently retired Chief Operating Officer of Guidant Corporation, has been elected to the Company's Board of Directors. Radiant Medical is sponsoring the COOL MI II Trial, a safety and efficacy clinical study designed to demonstrate that lowering core body temperature before and after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in the treatment of an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) will minimize damage to the heart muscle.
    "I'm very pleased about joining Radiant Medical at this stage of their development and look forward to working closely with their excellent team and prominent investors," stated Guido Neels. "The Company's new device-based therapy holds enormous potential for the over two million patients worldwide who suffer heart attacks each year," said Neels. "In addition to minimizing severe damage to the heart due to oxygen-deprivation, clinical research has shown that endovascular therapeutic hypothermia may also result in reduced inflammation and enhance tissue healing. All of this may lead to faster, more complete recoveries and, hopefully, a better quality of life for these patients."
    "We are fortunate to have an individual of the caliber of Guido Neels, who brings over 30 years of financial, managerial and global experience to the Company," said Kenneth G. Hayes, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Radiant Medical. "His business expertise and his role managing Guidant, one of the world's leading cardiovascular medical product companies, will add tremendous value to Radiant Medical."
    Mr. Neels joins five other distinguished members of Radiant Medical's Board of Directors. In addition to Mr. Hayes, the other board members are: Mark A. Wan, a General Partner at Three Arch Partners, Jeani Delagardelle, a Managing Director at New Leaf Venture Partners, William G. Gerber, M.D., a Partner at Bay City Capital, and Michael L. Eagle, retired Vice President of Manufacturing for Eli Lilly and Company.
    About Guido J. Neels
    Guido J. Neels served as Chief Operating Officer of Guidant Corporation, a world leader in the development of cardiovascular medical products, from May 2004 until retiring in November 2005. He was responsible for the global operations of Guidant's four operating units: Cardiac Rhythm Management, Vascular Intervention, Cardiac Surgery, and Endovascular Solutions. From December 2002 to May 2004, he was Group Chairman, Office of the President at Guidant, responsible for worldwide sales operations, corporate communications, corporate marketing, investor relations and government relations. From January 2000 to December 2002, he was President of Europe, Middle East, Africa and Canada. He previously served as Vice President of Global Marketing for Vascular Intervention and as Managing Director for German and Central European operations. From 1982 until Guidant was spun off as an independent public company from Eli Lilly and Co. in 1994, Mr. Neels held various general management and sales and marketing positions at Lilly in Europe and the U.S. From 1972 to 1980, he held positions in information technology, finance and manufacturing at Raychem Corporation in Belgium and the U.S.
    Mr. Neels has been an independent director with Biopure Corporation since August 2005. He holds a master of business administration degree from Stanford University and a business engineering degree from the University of Leuven in Belgium.
