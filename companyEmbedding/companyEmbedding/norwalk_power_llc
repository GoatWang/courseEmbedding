North American Power supplies electricity and natural gas to homes and small businesses.


View Rates & Plans




Did you know you can choose your home's electricity supply rate? Because of energy choice (otherwise called "deregulation"), you can choose the energy provider as well as the energy rate plan that supplies your home's electricity, as well as the rate plan you'd like to enroll in.
Your local utility company will continue to deliver the energy your home uses, and respond to emergencies and outages the way they always have. There's no interruption in service, and no equipment or service visit needed. The only thing that changes is the rate you pay and the energy supplier listed in the supplier section of your bill.


Here's how it works: As an independent energy supplier, North American Power purchases electricity on the wholesale market, and creates a selection of plans for you to choose from. You can shop directly on our website, and enroll online or over the phone.
Once enrolled, you can expect to see your new North American Power electricity supply rate on your bill generally within 1 to 2 billing cycles. Look for our name in the "supply" section of your monthly bill.
