College Savings







Diversification does not assure a profit nor does it protect against loss of principal.





Certificates of deposit (CDs) offered through American Century Brokerage are issued by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured institutions, and are subject to change and availability. There is a $55 early termination fee and possible market value adjustments. Brokered CDs will fluctuate in market value between purchase date and maturity date due to their ability to be sold on the secondary market. Because the secondary market for CDs is generally illiquid, a significant loss of principal could result if your CD is sold prior to maturity. American Century Brokerage makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution and does not endorse or recommend the CDs in any way.





Brokerage Services are provided by American Century Brokerage, a division of American Century Investment Services, Inc., registered broker/dealer, member FINRA, SIPC.
