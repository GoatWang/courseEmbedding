NEW YORK, June 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TIG Advisors, LLC and its securitized asset strategy (TSAF) won an award for Best ABS Fund for 2014 at the GlobalCapital's US Securitization Awards Dinner on June 10, 2015 at the Pierre Hotel in New York City. The award was determined by an industry wide poll in which over 80 different firms in the securitization industry participated.  "We are honored to be recognized for the second year in a row.  The award is particularly gratifying in that we were chosen by our peers and counterparties in the industry. None of this could have been achieved without the contributions of our team members and the support of the dealer community," said Stuart Lippman, chief investment officer and co-founder of the strategy at TIG.  "TSAF's performance is a testament to our team's ability to identify asymmetric opportunities, quickly enter and exit such opportunities, and use proprietary analytics to identify broader themes," said David Liu, chief strategist and co-founder of the strategy. "We will continue to strive to provide our investors long-term value by taking advantage of market dislocations within the structured credit markets."
TSAF was launched with $50MM on October 1, 2012. Today, the combined AUM of TIG's structured credit strategy is approaching $1B. The growth in AUM was driven by steady inflows and strategy performance. 
The TSAF team welcomes newest member - on June 1, Nirjhar Jain joined the TIG team as a Senior Portfolio Manager with primary focus on the CLO market. Most recently, Mr. Jain was a Managing Partner at Plus Funding Group, a specialty finance company that he co-founded and built. Prior to that, he was Head of US Securitized Credit Trading at Morgan Stanley. Mr. Jain also spent six years at Deutsche Bank where he traded various products including European Securitized Credit, ABX, Consumer ABS  and CLOs. He started his career at Lehman Brothers on the CLO Trading desk.

NEW YORK, Feb. 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- TIG Securitized Asset Fund, a long/short credit fund launched in October 2012, was recognized as 2013's Best New Fund by Hedge Fund Intelligence's Absolute Return awards. The awards ceremony was held in New York City on February 13, 2014.
Winners of the Absolute Return awards were announced at Gotham Hall, recognizing the best performing US hedge fund managers. In their research, Absolute Return emphasized the quality of returns more than the quantity. The awards are regarded as the most prestigious in the industry. Stuart Lippman and David Liu, co-founders of the fund, accepted the award. 
"An Absolute Return Award is a prestigious industry accolade which we're proud to accept," said David Liu, co-founder of TSAF. "Being named as New Fund of the Year is especially pleasing as the award recognizes risk-adjusted returns." 
TIG Securitized Asset Fund was selected from a group of nominees based on data included in Absolute Return's comprehensive Database of US Funds. The winners were chosen on the basis of various quantitative factors, including Sharpe ratio, performance and assets.
"TIG Securitized Asset Fund builds upon TIG Advisors' 34 years of investing experience," said Stuart Lippman. "We look forward to continuing to apply our formula in order to strive to generate steady and attractive returns in 2014 and beyond."  
TSAF was founded by Stuart Lippman and David Liu, who together have more than three decades of experience investing in structured products. The fund has a relative value focus, seeking to profit from both market fundamentals and dislocations created by regulatory changes, policy issues and market technicals focusing on RMBS/CMBS/ABS securities.

L.P. / LTD.

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        TIG Securitized Asset Fund LP/LTD has a relative value focus, seeking to profit from market dislocations created by regulatory changes, policy issues, and market technicals primarily in RMBS/CMBS/ABS securities. TSAF's goal is to perform in multiple market environments by identifying security level alpha. The Fund aims to generate consistent alpha through an analytical approach that identifies asymmetrical situations having low correlations to broad based market movements. The Fund's risk management system is specifically designed to mitigate downside risk and moderate volatility. The team's process focuses on using its proprietary database systems and security filtering to identify discrete market opportunities. TSAF's investment decisions are based on macro-economic market variables and a micro-credit discipline concentrating on loan level characteristics, securitized asset performance and structural differentiation. Our proprietary analytic tool set focuses on loan level data, home price projections, and servicing nuances in order to extract relative value. The team also relies upon their portfolio surveillance monitoring process to capture collateral performance and track developments that might alter current portfolio construction beliefs while potentially also highlighting new investment initiatives.
