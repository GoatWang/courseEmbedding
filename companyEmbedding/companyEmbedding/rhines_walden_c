Early life and education[edit]
Rhines was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His father, Frederick N. Rhines, was the Alcoa professor of light metals at the Carnegie Institute of Technology from 1946-1959 and founder of the department of materials science and engineering at the University of Florida, from which he retired in 1978; today the department is housed in Frederick N. Rhines Hall.[6][7] Rhines earned his bachelor of science in engineering (BSE) from the University of Michigan in 1968 and his master’s degree and Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from Stanford University in 1970 and 1972, respectively.[8] He earned his M.B.A. from Southern Methodist University in 1975.[8]
Career[edit]


"Moore’s Law will indeed become irrelevant to the semiconductor industry. But the remarkable progress in reducing the cost per bit, and cost per switch, will continue indefinitely, thanks to the learning curve. And with it, the number of new applications for electronics will continue to be limited only by the creativity of those who search for solutions to new problems."

—Walden C. Rhines, 2016. From a Scientific American guest blog post, Moore's Law and the Future of Solid-State Electronics.[9]
While at Stanford, Rhines co-invented the magnesium-doped gallium nitride blue light-emitting diode, for which he, Herb Maruska and David Stevenson were awarded a U.S. patent in 1974.[10] Isamu Akasaki built directly on this gallium-nitride research and eventually won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]
Rhines worked at Texas Instruments (TI) from 1972 to 1993, serving as executive vice president of the semiconductor group and president of the data systems group. While at TI, Rhines supervised development of speech synthesis chips used in the Speak & Spell; developed the first publicly available computer program (for a calculator) to calculate the Black-Scholes value of a stock option; and supervised the creation of the TMS320 digital signal processor.[19][20][21] In a 1985 profile of Rhines in the Austin American-Statesman, industry consultant Will Strauss told reporter Russell Mitchell: "He [Rhines] can claim the TMS-320 digital signal processor chip; that's the one to beat on the street right now."[22] By 1990, TI's share of the worldwide market for general purpose DSPs was approximately 60%.[23] A January 1991 article in Electronic Business Buyer reported that "[s]ources say that TI has the only profitable general purpose DSP operation in the world."[24]
Rhines became CEO of Mentor Graphics in 1993, when the company's annual revenue was about $340 million.[25][26] The company passed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2011.[27] In 2013 Mentor Graphics announced it would begin paying a quarterly dividend, making it the only of big three electronic design automation (EDA) companies to do so; (Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys are the other two).[28] Rhines has led the company into new business areas, including providing software for the auto industry; of the big three EDA companies, analyst Tom Diffely said "Mentor has the most going on in these adjacent markets...I think (the auto industry) is going to be a long-term huge market for them."[29]
Affiliations[edit]
Rhines has been elected five times (1996, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010) to serve two-year terms as chair of the Electronic Design Automation Consortium, the international trade association for the EDA industry.[30] He is a board member of TriQuint Semiconductor (1995–2015), QORVO (2015–present) and the Semiconductor Research Corporation (2002–present).[31][32] Previously he has served on the boards of Cirrus Logic (1995–2009), the Global Semiconductor Alliance (2007–2010), Global Logic Inc. (2014–present) and the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, now known as the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (1984–1987).[33][34][35] From 1996-2005 Rhines was a trustee at Lewis & Clark College, where he remains a life trustee today.[36]
Awards and honors[edit]

1998: honorary doctor of technology degree from Nottingham Trent University[37]
2002: Semico Research Bellwether Award[38]
2003: University of Michigan Alumni Society Merit Award in 2003[39]
2009: International Engineering Consortium distinguished fellow award[40]
2014: U.S. Army Legion of Valor of the United States Bronze Cross for Achievement and the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (he became an Eagle Scout in 1964).[41]

Early life and education[edit]
Rhines was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His father, Frederick N. Rhines, was the Alcoa professor of light metals at the Carnegie Institute of Technology from 1946-1959 and founder of the department of materials science and engineering at the University of Florida, from which he retired in 1978; today the department is housed in Frederick N. Rhines Hall.[6][7] Rhines earned his bachelor of science in engineering (BSE) from the University of Michigan in 1968 and his master’s degree and Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from Stanford University in 1970 and 1972, respectively.[8] He earned his M.B.A. from Southern Methodist University in 1975.[8]
Career[edit]


"Moore’s Law will indeed become irrelevant to the semiconductor industry. But the remarkable progress in reducing the cost per bit, and cost per switch, will continue indefinitely, thanks to the learning curve. And with it, the number of new applications for electronics will continue to be limited only by the creativity of those who search for solutions to new problems."

—Walden C. Rhines, 2016. From a Scientific American guest blog post, Moore's Law and the Future of Solid-State Electronics.[9]
While at Stanford, Rhines co-invented the magnesium-doped gallium nitride blue light-emitting diode, for which he, Herb Maruska and David Stevenson were awarded a U.S. patent in 1974.[10] Isamu Akasaki built directly on this gallium-nitride research and eventually won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]
Rhines worked at Texas Instruments (TI) from 1972 to 1993, serving as executive vice president of the semiconductor group and president of the data systems group. While at TI, Rhines supervised development of speech synthesis chips used in the Speak & Spell; developed the first publicly available computer program (for a calculator) to calculate the Black-Scholes value of a stock option; and supervised the creation of the TMS320 digital signal processor.[19][20][21] In a 1985 profile of Rhines in the Austin American-Statesman, industry consultant Will Strauss told reporter Russell Mitchell: "He [Rhines] can claim the TMS-320 digital signal processor chip; that's the one to beat on the street right now."[22] By 1990, TI's share of the worldwide market for general purpose DSPs was approximately 60%.[23] A January 1991 article in Electronic Business Buyer reported that "[s]ources say that TI has the only profitable general purpose DSP operation in the world."[24]
Rhines became CEO of Mentor Graphics in 1993, when the company's annual revenue was about $340 million.[25][26] The company passed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2011.[27] In 2013 Mentor Graphics announced it would begin paying a quarterly dividend, making it the only of big three electronic design automation (EDA) companies to do so; (Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys are the other two).[28] Rhines has led the company into new business areas, including providing software for the auto industry; of the big three EDA companies, analyst Tom Diffely said "Mentor has the most going on in these adjacent markets...I think (the auto industry) is going to be a long-term huge market for them."[29]
Affiliations[edit]
Rhines has been elected five times (1996, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010) to serve two-year terms as chair of the Electronic Design Automation Consortium, the international trade association for the EDA industry.[30] He is a board member of TriQuint Semiconductor (1995–2015), QORVO (2015–present) and the Semiconductor Research Corporation (2002–present).[31][32] Previously he has served on the boards of Cirrus Logic (1995–2009), the Global Semiconductor Alliance (2007–2010), Global Logic Inc. (2014–present) and the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, now known as the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (1984–1987).[33][34][35] From 1996-2005 Rhines was a trustee at Lewis & Clark College, where he remains a life trustee today.[36]
Awards and honors[edit]

1998: honorary doctor of technology degree from Nottingham Trent University[37]
2002: Semico Research Bellwether Award[38]
2003: University of Michigan Alumni Society Merit Award in 2003[39]
2009: International Engineering Consortium distinguished fellow award[40]
2014: U.S. Army Legion of Valor of the United States Bronze Cross for Achievement and the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (he became an Eagle Scout in 1964).[41]
2015: Phil Kaufman Award for his contributions to the EDA and IC design industries.[42]

Rhines became CEO of Mentor Graphics in 1993, when the company's annual revenue was about $340 million.[25][26] The company passed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2011.[27] In 2013 Mentor Graphics announced it would begin paying a quarterly dividend, making it the only of big three electronic design automation (EDA) companies to do so; (Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys are the other two).[28] Rhines has led the company into new business areas, including providing software for the auto industry; of the big three EDA companies, analyst Tom Diffely said "Mentor has the most going on in these adjacent markets...I think (the auto industry) is going to be a long-term huge market for them."[29]
Affiliations[edit]
Rhines has been elected five times (1996, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010) to serve two-year terms as chair of the Electronic Design Automation Consortium, the international trade association for the EDA industry.[30] He is a board member of TriQuint Semiconductor (1995–2015), QORVO (2015–present) and the Semiconductor Research Corporation (2002–present).[31][32] Previously he has served on the boards of Cirrus Logic (1995–2009), the Global Semiconductor Alliance (2007–2010), Global Logic Inc. (2014–present) and the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, now known as the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (1984–1987).[33][34][35] From 1996-2005 Rhines was a trustee at Lewis & Clark College, where he remains a life trustee today.[36]

Early life and education[edit]
Rhines was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His father, Frederick N. Rhines, was the Alcoa professor of light metals at the Carnegie Institute of Technology from 1946-1959 and founder of the department of materials science and engineering at the University of Florida, from which he retired in 1978; today the department is housed in Frederick N. Rhines Hall.[6][7] Rhines earned his bachelor of science in engineering (BSE) from the University of Michigan in 1968 and his master’s degree and Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from Stanford University in 1970 and 1972, respectively.[8] He earned his M.B.A. from Southern Methodist University in 1975.[8]
Career[edit]


"Moore’s Law will indeed become irrelevant to the semiconductor industry. But the remarkable progress in reducing the cost per bit, and cost per switch, will continue indefinitely, thanks to the learning curve. And with it, the number of new applications for electronics will continue to be limited only by the creativity of those who search for solutions to new problems."

—Walden C. Rhines, 2016. From a Scientific American guest blog post, Moore's Law and the Future of Solid-State Electronics.[9]
While at Stanford, Rhines co-invented the magnesium-doped gallium nitride blue light-emitting diode, for which he, Herb Maruska and David Stevenson were awarded a U.S. patent in 1974.[10] Isamu Akasaki built directly on this gallium-nitride research and eventually won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]
Rhines worked at Texas Instruments (TI) from 1972 to 1993, serving as executive vice president of the semiconductor group and president of the data systems group. While at TI, Rhines supervised development of speech synthesis chips used in the Speak & Spell; developed the first publicly available computer program (for a calculator) to calculate the Black-Scholes value of a stock option; and supervised the creation of the TMS320 digital signal processor.[19][20][21] In a 1985 profile of Rhines in the Austin American-Statesman, industry consultant Will Strauss told reporter Russell Mitchell: "He [Rhines] can claim the TMS-320 digital signal processor chip; that's the one to beat on the street right now."[22] By 1990, TI's share of the worldwide market for general purpose DSPs was approximately 60%.[23] A January 1991 article in Electronic Business Buyer reported that "[s]ources say that TI has the only profitable general purpose DSP operation in the world."[24]

Rhines Hall.[6][7] Rhines earned his bachelor of science in engineering (BSE) from the University of Michigan in 1968 and his master’s degree and Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from Stanford University in 1970 and 1972, respectively.[8] He earned his M.B.A. from Southern Methodist University in 1975.[8]
Career[edit]


"Moore’s Law will indeed become irrelevant to the semiconductor industry. But the remarkable progress in reducing the cost per bit, and cost per switch, will continue indefinitely, thanks to the learning curve. And with it, the number of new applications for electronics will continue to be limited only by the creativity of those who search for solutions to new problems."

—Walden C. Rhines, 2016. From a Scientific American guest blog post, Moore's Law and the Future of Solid-State Electronics.[9]
While at Stanford, Rhines co-invented the magnesium-doped gallium nitride blue light-emitting diode, for which he, Herb Maruska and David Stevenson were awarded a U.S. patent in 1974.[10] Isamu Akasaki built directly on this gallium-nitride research and eventually won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]
Rhines worked at Texas Instruments (TI) from 1972 to 1993, serving as executive vice president of the semiconductor group and president of the data systems group. While at TI, Rhines supervised development of speech synthesis chips used in the Speak & Spell; developed the first publicly available computer program (for a calculator) to calculate the Black-Scholes value of a stock option; and supervised the creation of the TMS320 digital signal processor.[19][20][21] In a 1985 profile of Rhines in the Austin American-Statesman, industry consultant Will Strauss told reporter Russell Mitchell: "He [Rhines] can claim the TMS-320 digital signal processor chip; that's the one to beat on the street right now."[22] By 1990, TI's share of the worldwide market for general purpose DSPs was approximately 60%.[23] A January 1991 article in Electronic Business Buyer reported that "[s]ources say that TI has the only profitable general purpose DSP operation in the world."[24]
Rhines became CEO of Mentor Graphics in 1993, when the company's annual revenue was about $340 million.[25][26] The company passed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2011.[27] In 2013 Mentor Graphics announced it would begin paying a quarterly dividend, making it the only of big three electronic design automation (EDA) companies to do so; (Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys are the other two).[28] Rhines has led the company into new business areas, including providing software for the auto industry; of the big three EDA companies, analyst Tom Diffely said "Mentor has the most going on in these adjacent markets...I think (the auto industry) is going to be a long-term huge market for them."[29]
Affiliations[edit]
Rhines has been elected five times (1996, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010) to serve two-year terms as chair of the Electronic Design Automation Consortium, the international trade association for the EDA industry.[30] He is a board member of TriQuint Semiconductor (1995–2015), QORVO (2015–present) and the Semiconductor Research Corporation (2002–present).[31][32] Previously he has served on the boards of Cirrus Logic (1995–2009), the Global Semiconductor Alliance (2007–2010), Global Logic Inc. (2014–present) and the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, now known as the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (1984–1987).[33][34][35] From 1996-2005 Rhines was a trustee at Lewis & Clark College, where he remains a life trustee today.[36]
Awards and honors[edit]

1998: honorary doctor of technology degree from Nottingham Trent University[37]
2002: Semico Research Bellwether Award[38]
2003: University of Michigan Alumni Society Merit Award in 2003[39]
2009: International Engineering Consortium distinguished fellow award[40]

Embedded software: Next revolution in EDA

April 16, 2013
Pradeep Chakraborty 1 comment



Dr. Wally Rhines.
There is a key lesson that Mentor Graphics made while trying to deliver solutions that were right for software and hardware developers. The lesson was: tailor the software to the discipline! Make it as similar to their environment as possible!!
Delivering his speech at the ongoing 13th Global Electronics Summit in Santa Cruz, USA, Dr. Wally Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics, said that 15 years of acquisitions taught Mentor how to think and behave as an embedded software company.
Open systems requires active engagement in software committees. Each open source project has some form of governance to manage contributions, release plans, etc. There is a community peer selection process for each open source project. About 50 Mentor Embedded Sourcerers are actively involved in the open source and Android communities.
There is a need to take the advantage of knowing both worlds. Mentor’s Sourcery CodeBench is an embedded C/C++ development tool based on open-source standards. Sourcery CodeBench is a complete development environment for embedded C/C++ development on ARM, Coldfire, MIPS, Power, X86, and other architectures. You can install, flash and debug in minutes!
Sourcery CodeBench
Sourcery CodeBench is now the semiconductor industry’s leading embedded toolchain. There is an integrated development environment. It has the GNU compiler (GCC) and optimization tools. It allows debugging and analysis, libraries and QEMU simulator.
There are about ~15,000 downloads per month. There have been ~150,000 downloads and 300 releases per year.

Focus on good power-aware verification strategy for SoCs: Dr. Wally Rhines

January 7, 2013
Pradeep Chakraborty 1 comment



Dr. Wally Rhines.
It is always a pleasure to chat with Dr. Wally (Walden C.) Rhines, chairman and CEO, of Mentor Graphics. I chatted with him, trying to understand gigascale design, verification trends, strategy for power-aware verification, SERDES design challenges, migrating to 3D FinFET transistors, and Moore’s Law getting to be “Moore Stress”!
Chip design in gigascale, hertz, complex
First, I asked him to elaborate on how implementation of chip design will evolve, with respect to gigascale design, gigahertz and gigacomplex geometries.
He said: “Thanks to close co-operation among members of the foundry ecosystem, as well as cooperation between IDMs and their suppliers, serious development of design methods and software tools is running two to three generations ahead of volume manufacturing capability. For most applications, “Gigascale” power dissipation is a bigger challenge than managing the complexity but “system-level” power optimization tools will continue to allow rapid progress. Thermal analysis is becoming part of the designer’s toolkit.”
Functional verification is continually challenged by complexity but there have been, and continue to be, many orders of magnitude improvement in performance just from adoption of emulation, intelligent test benches and formal methods so this will not be a major limitation.
The complexity of new physical design problems will, however, be very challenging. Design problems ranging from basic ESD analysis, made more complex due to multiple power domains, to EMI, electromigration and intra-die variability are now being addressed with new design approaches. Fortunately, programmable electrical rule checking is being widely adopted and will help to minimize the impact of these physical effects.
Is verification keeping up?
How is the innovation in verification keeping up with trends?
Dr. Rhines added that over the past decade, microprocessor clock speeds have leveled out at 3 to 4 GHz and server performance improvement has come mostly from multi-core architectures. Although some innovative approaches have allowed simulators to gain some advantage from multi-core architectures, the speed of simulators hasn’t kept up with the growing complexity of leading edge chips.
Emulators have more than made up the difference. Emulators offer more than four orders of magnitude faster performance than simulators and emulators do so at about 0.005X the cost per cycle of simulation. The cost of power per year is more than one third the cost of hardware in a large simulation farm today, while emulation offers a 12X savings in power per verification clock cycle. For those who design really complex chips, a combination of emulation and simulation, along with formal methods and intelligent test benches, has become standard.
At the block and subsystem level, high level synthesis is enabling the next move up in design and verification abstraction. Since verification complexity grows at about the square of component count, we have plenty of room to handle larger chips by taking advantage of the four orders of magnitude improvement through emulation plus another three or four orders of magnitude through formal verification techniques, two to three orders of magnitude from intelligent test benches and three orders of magnitude from higher levels of abstraction.
By applying multiple engines and multiple abstraction levels to the challenge of verifying chips, the pressure is on to integrate the flow. Easily transitioning and reusing verification efforts from every level—including tests and coverage models, from high level models to RTL and from simulation to emulation—is being enabled through more powerful and adaptable verification IP and high level, graph-based test specification capabilities. These are keys to driving verification reuse to match the level of design reuse.
Powerful verification management solutions enable the collection of coverage information from all engines and abstraction levels, tracking progress against functional specifications and verification plans. Combining verification cycle productivity growth from emulation, formal, simulation and intelligent testing with higher verification abstraction, re-use and process management provides a path forward to economically verifying even the largest, most complex chips on time and within budget.
Good power-aware verification strategy for SoCs
What should be a good power-aware verification strategy for SoCs
According to him, the most important guideline is to start power-aware design at the highest possible level of system description. The opportunity to reduce system power is typically an order of magnitude greater at the system level than at the RTL level. For most chips today, that means at least the transaction level when the design is still described in C++ or SystemC.
Significant experience and effort should then be invested at the RTL level using synthesis and UPF-enabled simulation. Verification solutions typically automate the generation of correctness checks for power-control sequences and power-state coverage metrics. As SoC power is typically managed by software, the value of a hardware/software co-verification and co-debug solution in simulation and emulation becomes apparent in power-management verification at this level.
As designers proceed to the gate and transistor level, accuracy of power estimation improves. That is why gate level analysis and verification of the fully implemented power management architecture is important. Finally, at the physical layout, designers traditionally were stuck with whatever power budget was passed down to them. Now,they increasingly have power goals that can be achieved using dozens of physical design techniques that are built into the place and route tools.

Next wave of design challenges, and future growth of EDA: Dr. Wally Rhines

December 15, 2012
Pradeep Chakraborty 1 comment



Dr. Wally Rhines.
Today, EDA requires specialization. Elaborating on EDA over the past decade, Dr. Walden (Wally) C. Rhines, chairman and CEO, of Mentor Graphics, and vice chairman of the EDA Consortium, USA, said that PCB design has been flat despite growth in analysis, DFM and new emerging markets. Front end design has seen growth from RF/analog design and simulation, and analysis As design methodologies mature, EDA expenditures stop growing. He was speaking at Mentor Graphics’ U2U (User2User) conference in Bangalore, India.
Most of the EDA revenue growth comes from major new design methodologies, such as ESL, DFM, analog-mixed signal and RF. PCB design trend continues to be flat, and includes license and maintenance. The IC layout verification market is pointing to a 2.1 percent CAGR at the end of 2011. The RTL simulation market has been growing at 1.3 percent CAGR for the last decade. The IC physical implementation market has been growing at 3,4 percent CAGR for the last decade.
Growth areas in EDA from 2000-2011 include DFM at 28 percent CAGR, formal verification at 12 percent, ESL at 11 pecent, and IC/ASIC analysis at 9 percent, respectively.
What will generate the next wave of electronic product design challenges, and the future growth of EDA? This would involve solving new problems that are not part of the traditional EDA, and ‘do what others don’t do!
Methodology changes that may change EDA
There are five factors that can make this happen. These are:
* Low power design beyond RTL (and even ESL).
* Functional verification beyond simulation.
* Physical verification beyond design for manufacturability.
* Design for test beyond compression.
* System design beyond PCBs
Low power design at higher levels
Power affects every design stage. Sometimes, designing for low power at system level is required. System level optimization has the biggest impact on power/performance. And, embedded software is a major point of leverage.
Embedded software has an increasing share of the design effort. Here, Mentor’s Nucleus power management framework is key. It has an unique API for power management, enables software engineers to optimize power consumption, and reduces lines of application code. Also, power aware design optimizes code efficiency.
Functional verification beyond RTL simulation
The Verification methodology standards war is over. UVM is expected to grow by 286 percent in the next 12 months. Mentor Graphics Questa inFact is the industry’s most advanced testbench automation solution. It enables Testbench re-use and accelerates time-to-coverage. Intelligent test bench facilitates linear transition to multi-processing.
Questa accelerates the hardware/software verification environment. In-circuit emulation has been evolving to virtual hardware acceleration and embedded software development. Offline debug increases development productivity. A four-hour on-emulator software debug session drops to 30 minutes batch run. The offline debug allows 150 software designers to jumpstart debug process on source code. Virtual stimulus increases the flexibility of the emulator. As an example, Veloce is 700x more efficient than large simulation farms.
Physical verification beyond design for manufacturability
The Calibre PERC is a new approach to circuit verification. The Calibre 3DSTACK is the verification flow for 3D.

Dr. Wally Rhines on global semiconductor industry outlook 2013

November 21, 2012
Pradeep Chakraborty 3 comments



Dr. Wally Rhines.
It always gives me great pleasure chatting with Dr. Walden (Wallly) C. Rhines, chairman and CEO, of Mentor Graphics, and vice chairman of the EDA Consortium, USA. 2013 is just round the corner. What lies ahead for the global semiconductor industry is a question on everyone’s lips! How will the EDA industry do next year? For that matter, what should the Indian semiconductor industry look forward to next year?
Three trends for 2013
First, I asked Dr. Wally Rhines regarding the trends in the global semiconductor industry. He cited:
* Growth in communication ICs.
* Growth in the third dimension.
* Accelerated design activity at the leading edge.
Growth in communication ICs: On the macro level, silicon area shipments continue to grow gradually, as do semiconductor unit shipments. However, there’s a major shift in application segments from computing to communications. Communications used to be only one third the size of computing in terms of semiconductor usage.
Communications are expected to surpass computing in terms of semiconductor consumption by 2014 thanks to the rapid growth of wireless applications, the incorporation of computing into communications devices like smart phones and the addition of communications to computing devices like tablet computers.
Growth in the third dimension: Shrinking feature sizes and growing wafer diameters will continue to contribute to the annual 30 percent decrease in the average cost per transistor and average 72 percent unit growth of transistors, but they will do so at a diminished rate. Fortunately, other avenues are emerging that can help sustain the semiconductor industry’s remarkable rate of growth. One largely untapped opportunity is in the third dimension, i.e. growing vertically instead of shrinking in the XY plane.
DRAM stacks of eight or more die are already possible, although they are still more expensive on a cost per bit basis compared to unstacked devices. Complex packaged systems made up of multiple heterogeneous die, memory stacked on logic and interposers to connect the die are evolving rapidly. Layers in the IC manufacturing process continue to increase as well.
Accelerated design activity at the leading edge: Another interesting trend is the recent surge in capital spending among foundries to add capacity at the leading edge. This wave of spending will result in excess capacity, at least initially, which may force foundries to lower prices to boost demand. In fact, capacity utilization data in the last few months shows a dramatic decline in utilization at 28/32nm and 22nm nodes, suggesting that excess capacity is already happening to an extent.
While differences in 28 and 20nm processes—such as double patterning—create challenges, the existing capital equipment is largely compatible with both processes. Such a high volume of wafers and the large available capacity will lead to increasingly aggressive wafer pricing over time. As a result, cost-effective wafers from foundries will encourage totally new designs that would not have been possible at today’s wafer cost.
Industry outlook 2013
So, how is the outlook for 2013 going to shape up? Dr. Rhines said: “After almost no growth in 2012, most analysts are expecting improvement in semiconductor market growth in the coming year. Currently, the analyst forecasts for the semiconductor industry in 2013 range from 4.2 percent on the low side to 16.6 percent on the high side, with most firms coming in between 6 percent and 10 percent. The average of forecasts among the major semiconductor analyst firms is approximately 8.2 percent.
“However, most semiconductor companies are less optimistic in their published outlooks. This seems to be influenced by the level of uncertainty that exists because of unknown government actions and market conditions in the US, Europe and China.”
Any more consolidations?
It would be interesting to hear Dr. Rhines’ opinion on any further consolidations within the industry. He said: “It is common misperception that the semiconductor industry is consolidating. A closer look at the data shows that the semiconductor industry has been doing the opposite. It has been DE-consolidating for more than 40 years.
“Take the #1 semiconductor supplier, Intel. Intel’s market share is the same today as it was a decade ago. And, the combined market share of the top five semiconductor suppliers has been slowly declining since the 1960s. Similar trends also apply to the top ten and top 50—both are the same or lower than they were a decade, as well as decades, ago. In fact, the combined market share of the top 50 semiconductor companies has decreased 11 points in the last 12 years.

Dr. Wally Rhines on global EDA industry

September 18, 2012
Pradeep Chakraborty Comments off



It is always a pleasure interacting with Dr. Walden (Wally) C. Rhines, the chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics, and vice chairman of the EDA Consortium, USA. I started by enquiring about the global semiconductor industry.
Dr. Wally Rhines
Dr. Wally Rhines said: “The absolute size of the semiconductor industry (in terms or total revenue) differs depending on which analyst you ask, because of differences in methodology and the breadth of analysts’ surveys. Current 2012 forecasts include $316 billion from Gartner, $320 billion from IDC, $324.5 billion from IHS iSuppli, $327.2 billion from Semico Research and $339 billion from IC Insights.
“These numbers reflect growth rates from 4 per cent to 9.2 per cent, based on the different analyst-specific 2011 totals. Capital spending forecasts for the three largest semiconductor companies have increased by almost 50 per cent just since the beginning of this year. However, the initial spurt of demand was influenced by the replenishment of computer and disc drive inventories caused by the Thailand flooding. Now that this is largely complete, there is some uncertainty about the second half.
“So, overall it looks like the industry will pass $310 billion this year, but it may not be by very much. The strong capital spending and demand for leading edge capacity should impact the second half but the bigger impact will probably be in 2013.
What’s with 28.20nm?
Has 28/20nm semiconductor technology become a major ‘work horse’? What’s going on in that area? At least, this area is now of considerable interest.
Dr. Rhines said that the semiconductor industry’s transition to the 28nm family of technologies, which broadly includes 32nm and 20nm, is a much larger transition than we have experienced for many technology generations.
The world’s 28nm-capable capacity now comprises almost 20 per cent of the total silicon area in production and yet, the silicon foundries are fully loaded with more 28nm demand than they can handle. In fact, high demand for 28/20nm has created a capacity pinch that is currently spurring additional capital expenditure by foundries.
He added: “As yields and throughput mature at 28nm, the major wave of capital investment will provide plentiful foundry capacity at lower cost, stimulating a major wave of design activity. Cost-effective, high yield 28nm foundry capacity will not only drive increasing numbers of new designs but it will also force re-designs of mature products to take advantage of the cost reduction opportunity.”

Ingredients for successful fabless Indian semiconductor industry: Dr. Wally Rhines

February 7, 2012
Pradeep Chakraborty 1 comment



Dr. Wally Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics.
According to Dr. Walden (Wally) C. Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics Corp., while fabless startups have declined substantially in the West during the past decade, they are growing in India.
Given the time required to grow large fabless companies in the past, India should not be discouraged by current progress. India has key capabilities to stimulate growth of fabless companies, such as:
* Design services companies.
* Design engineering expertise and innovation.
* Returning entrepreneurs.
* Educational system.
Semiconductor frustrations abound! I recall a discussion in mid-2005 where an industry expert mentioned that fabless was the way forward for the Indian industry! Between then and now, fabs were supposed to come up, but they failed. Nevertheless, one must not give up hope!
As of now, there seems to be too much focus on services, multinational company dominance, perceived lack of progress, perceived lag compared to China, lack of foundry infrastructure, and no clear dominant indigenous Indian company.
Of the top 50 semiconductor companies in 2011, 12 are fabless and four are foundries. Fabless IC revenue has been growing at 17 percent CAGR since 1997 and will continue to grow. Even the fabless market has been gaining in the overall market. However, the fabless revenue is said to be highly concentrated. He added that the leading fabless companies specialize and average ~23 years since formation. Also, the VC funding for fabless semiconductor companies has been declining in the West. As for the number of fabless companies, the GSA put it at 1,200 companies, at the end of 2010.
According to Dr. Rhines, the semiconductor IP market would grow to about $3,707 million by 2015, at a CAGR of 14 percent. The leading semicon IP players specialize and average 22 years in business (similar to fabless).
Now, India is said to be among the top five semiconductor design locations worldwide (SIP + fabless + design services). Also, India is a leading source of semicon IP, accounting for 5.3 percent globally. From the looks of it, India seems to have built a foundation for a fabless future. India can well become the next great fabless incubator! Read more…

Global semiconductor industry keeps consolidating; 28nm will be stable: Dr. Wally Rhines

December 2, 2011
Pradeep Chakraborty Comments off



Dr. Wally Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics.
The global semiconductor industry keeps consolidating, said Dr. Walden (Wally) Rhines, while making the keynote presentation at the ongoing Mentor Graphics’ U2U conference in Bangalore, India.
According to a survey, the no. 1’s market share has been relatively flat since 1972. The combined share of the top five semiconductor companies has been nearly the same as that of 1972. However, the share of the top 10 companies has been nearly the same but less than the historical average. If you look at the numbers, it is also evident that Texas Instruments’ (TI) acquisition of National Semiconductors has had negligible impact. Also, the market share of the top 50 semiconductor companies continues to decline, especially in the last decade.
The answer lies in the fact that manufacturing is consolidating, while semiconductor is not! Foundries share of semiconductor revenue has increased. The share of total IC production has been flat. However, foundry capex has tripled over the last two years. Also, 28nm/32nm capacity has been sold out, and prices rising have been put on top of the next slide. Foundries are likely to revamp and record the highest market share of the 28nm/20nm market. Foundry spending is said to be at an all time high as percentage of total capex.
There have been significant design changes. In fact, 28nm has now become the ‘work horse’ technology. There have been high yields and at lower costs. The accelerated design activity has seen redesign take advantage of smalller node efficiencies. So, how can you prepare? Perhaps, do more design in less time, and use the same resources. Or, you could do less of power devices.
Significant changes are coming in design. Because of 2010/2011 capital expenditures, 28/20nm semiconductor technology will become a major “work horse” compared to previous technology generations. Plenty of wafers will be available from silicon foundries. Yields will be high and costs will be low.  As a result, design activity will accelerate beginning in late 2012 to take advantage of the 28nm capability and capacity. Favorable costs and yields will cause semiconductor companies to redesign 180/130/90/65/45nm products into 28/20nm versions while adding functionality. Totally new applications will emerge because of the 28/20nm capability and cost, thus growing the semiconductor market in 2014+.
Implications of plentiful 28/20nm foundry capacity include: 28nm will become “work horse” technology. There will be high yields and low costs, as well as an accelerated design activity. Redesigns will take advantage of smaller node cost efficiencies. New designs will leverage the additional transistors.
In future, more companies will be moving to ESL-based design. Place and route will be more in fashion — 20nm double patterning, as well as DFM and integrated verification. DFM will pave the way for designing for reliability. The metal layer stack has been doubling as device complexity has been rising. Another factor is reliability checking. Initial efforts aer being offered at TSMC AMS flow 2.0. More will be offered by TSMC for digital flow in Q4.

Dr. Wally Rhines on global semicon industry

July 24, 2011
Pradeep Chakraborty 3 comments



Thanks to my friend, Veeresh Shetty at Mentor Graphics, I was able to meet up with Dr. Walden (Wally) C. Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics, as well as with Hanns Windele, VP Mentor Graphics (Europe & India), for a short conversation regarding the global semiconductor industry.
Growth of global semicon industry
First, I sought Dr. Rhines’ views on the growth of the global semiconductor industry. Dr. Rhines said: “Capital investment in the foundries has been quite high. TSMC, GlobalFoundries, Samsung, etc., have invested double. In 2012, some of the foundries will run at a lower percentage of capacity. If that happens, foundry wafer prices might fall. However, equipment prices would not decrease.”
So, what has the industry learned from the previous recession? He said: “Capacity in the semicon industry was relatively tight in Q408. In 2009, we called it as inventory correction. If we had not had a recession, there would have been a capacity shortage.
“Now, companies seem to have caught up. There was large investment in the manufacturing capacity in 2010, and that has continued into 2011. There is more new capacity coming into foundries by 2012. Investment in memory has been modest. However, fabless companies should find more capacity in 2012.”
Hanns Windele added: “The automotive industry was contributing to all of this as well. As of now, 45 percent is consumed by the computer industry, 20 percent by the communications industry, and consumer electronics and automotive account for 5-10 percent, approximately.”
It appears that everything that one buys today, communications seems to be attached to it. Dr. Rhines also reckoned that PC shipments were holding up well, for now. Read more…

Creating measurable value through differentiation: Dr. Wally Rhines

July 22, 2011
Pradeep Chakraborty 1 comment



Dr. Walden (Wally) C. Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics.
According to Dr. Walden (Wally) C. Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics Corp., customers pay a premium for differentiated products. Gross profit margin (GPM) percentage is the best measure for the differentiation of a manufactured product. The difficulty of switching suppliers is proportional to differentiation and GPM. He was speaking at the EDA Tech Forum 2011 in Bangalore, India.
As an example, Apple released the Mac Classic to compete with IBM clones to regain market share in the PC industry. However, it did not gain market ascendancy. It was only when Apple introduced the iPod in 2H’ 01 that things began changing. Later, it introduced the Apple iPad 2H ’07. The rest is, for now, history.
Product differentiation is said to be easiest in new and emerging markets. Apple has since invested in semiconductor design, while Nokia has divested. Apple now reduces power and improves performance through design differentiation.
On the other hand, Nokia has divested of IC design as it is now difficult to create a differentiated ecosystem even for the leader (Nokia). As of now, it is using Windows Mobile 7 for developing smartphones. The question is: is the Android vs. iPhone an analogy to the PC vs. the Mac?
The smartphone market will eventually commoditize. However, this time, there has been substantial differentiation. Product differentiation does provide temporary differentiation.  However, a company created infrastructure sustains differentiation. The third-party ecosystem drives a longer term differentiation.
Now, Apple isn’t the only company with sustainable differentiation. Intel and AMD have also invested in application development, with Intel’s x86 MPUs differentiation a prime example.
In mature commodity products, system integration reduces cost and power with increasing performance. For example, Texas Instruments’ calculators are commoditized and selling well. The practise of involving education in product development has helped TI. Read more…

Mentor’s Wally Rhines on global EDA industry challenges – II

December 15, 2010
Pradeep Chakraborty Comments off



Dr. Wally Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics.
This is the concluding part of my discussion with Dr. Walden (Wally) C. Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics.
EDA’s role in modeling and photomask correction
I asked Dr. Rhines about the future of EDA’s role in modeling and photomask correction. He said that in just a decade, resolution enhancement has grown from zero to over $200 million in annual revenue for the EDA industry.
“Almost all of this revenue is concentrated in two EDA companies. The value of this EDA software is clearly recognized by manufacturers. Mentor has many partnerships with manufacturers and a joint development program targeting 20nm resolution enhancement with IBM.”
Handling 22nm and sub-22nm levels
Next, with new process technology nodes becoming quite the talk of the desgin community, what does EDA now need to do at 22nm and sub 22nm levels.
Dr. Rhines said: “We have been working with our customers on this for quite some time now and are in fact well down this path. We think that most of the problems have been solved, or are solvable. Obviously, most of the issues here revolve around the lithography and manufacturability, but the EDA industry has been leading this since optical proximity correction became a key technology for the fabs quite some time ago.”
Density area savings
In an earlier discussion, the issue of how compelling would integration density area savings remain by going to new nodes had come up. I have to repeat this question, as it still seems to remain an issue.
So, how long will the integration density area savings you get by going to new nodes remain compelling?
“Hard to say!” noted Dr. Rhines. “We can see a path to 15nm with the traditional 193nm immersion lithography, and we usually surprise ourselves in our ability to go farther than we think we can. However, even if density slows down, this is but one way to achieve the continuous performance improvements that we’ve seen over the years in silicon.
“3D silicon, for instance, holds the promise of allowing us to continue to grow performance without necessarily doing it by just continuing the process shrink. Logic and memory have been on a predictable “learning curve” since the vacuum tube and I don’t expect that learning curve to deviate anytime in the foreseeable future.” Read more…

Mentor’s Wally Rhines on global EDA industry challenges – I

December 14, 2010
Pradeep Chakraborty Comments off



Dr.  Wally Rhines, CEO and chairman, Mentor Graphics.
It has always been such a pleasure meeting Dr.  Walden (Wally) C. Rhines, CEO and chairman, Mentor Graphics Corp. During his recent visit to India, I managed to enter into a discussion with him regarding various issues facing the global EDA industry.
Part one of the discussion looks at the industry, as well as EDA related issues such as predictability, verification and IP integration, how can Mentor help start-ups address EDA challenges, and going about software-to-silicon verification. May I also take this opportunity to thank my good friend, Mentor’s Veeresh Shetty.
I began by asking Dr. Wally Rhines about the fortunes of the global EDA industry and what’s it going to be like in 2011?
He said: “The EDA industry typically follows the recovery in semiconductor industry R&D spending by six to 12 months. Mentor’s strong results in Q3 (with 60 percent growth in bookings) suggest that the recovery has already started. In our third quarter conference call, we indicated to our investors that 2011 looks like a good year as well.”  Read more…

EDA and emerging system design challenges: Dr. Wally Rhines

December 10, 2010
Pradeep Chakraborty 2 comments



Dr. Wally Rhines.
According to Dr. Walden C. Rhines, CEO and chairman, Mentor Graphics, the emerging system design challenges likely to shape the industry in the coming decade are:
* Design for low power.
* Optimizing for performance and power.
* Functional verification complexity explosion.
* Place and route timing and power closure.
* Physical verification complexity.
* Manufacturing yields.
* Increasing cost of design.
* Macro system integration.
He was delivering the keynote titled ﻿EDA and emerging system design challenges at Mentor Graphics’ U2U India conference in Bangalore.
First, Dr. Rhines highlighted that the EDA market churn is often confused with industry consolidation. EDA requires specialization. The #1 supplier in each EDA product segment averages 66 percent+ market share. However, the traditional EDA market has not been growing.
EDA market snapshot
The synthesis market trend has seen a 2.7 percent CAGR, with a 10-year average of $293 million. The market size was $273 million in 2008, and slid to $243 million in 2009. In 2010, after the first two quarters, it is approximately $125-$130 million.
The RTL simulation market trend has seen a -0.3 percent CAGR, with a 10-year average of $365 million. The market size was $394 million in 2008, and slid to $345 million in 2009. In 2010, after the first two quarters, it is approximately $150 million.
The IC layout verification market trend has seen a 0 percent CAGR, with a 10-year average of $199 million. The market size was $199 million in 2008, and slid to $187 million in 2009. In 2010, after the first two quarters, it is approximately $80-$90 million.
The IC physical implementation market trend has seen a 2.4 percent CAGR, with a 10-year average of $559 million. The market size was $549 million in 2008, and slid to $448 million in 2009. In 2010, after the first two quarters, it is approximately $210 million.
The total PCB/MCM design market trend has had a 10-year average of $484 million. The market size was $535 million in 2008, and slid to $490 million in 2009. In 2010, after the first two quarters, it is approximately $220 million. PCB design has seen growth from analysis, design for manufacturing and new emerging markets. Read more…

EDA Tech Forum 2010: Delivering the latest in 10X design improvements

August 18, 2010
Pradeep Chakraborty 2 comments



Pravin Madhani, GM, Place and Route Division, Mentor Graphics.
I’ve just returned from Mentor Graphics’ EDA Tech Forum 2010, titled: Delivering the latest in 10X design improvements. The opening keynote by Pravin Madhani, GM, Place and Route Division, Mentor, could have been better — well, Dr. Walden C. Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor, had also delivered a similar lecture at this year’s VLSID 2010 conference.
However, the other two keynotes — by Dr. Kota Murali, lead scientist & program manager of nanotech, IBM India, and Manjunath Hebbar, VP & Head – Strategic Services, HCL Technologies Ltd, lived up to their billing.
The photomask industry is between the proverbial hard rock and the hard place. For instance, at 32nm, the mask cost works out to be $2 million today. In his keynote, Madhani said that the manufacturing industry would surely figure out a way to control mask costs.
Even fab costs are pretty high today — estimated at $50 billion in 2010, that is ~10 percent of the annual market. The global fab industry continues to figure out how to decrease costs. While design costs are projected to grow logarithmically, cost per function will continue to decline long after Moore’s Law is obsolete.
So, will we have any use for so many transistors? Down the years, growth in unit volumes has always distinguished the semiconductor industry. The semicon industry has been growing at 13 percent (10-year CAGR), while transistors have grown at 49 percent. These sit very well, as compared to say, computers – 9.3 percent, steel — 5.3 percent, and automobiles — 0.1 percent. The 49 percent transistor growth drives the semicon industry.
Madhani said that the note/netbook market seems to have several years of growth ahead. The Apple iPad has also created a new segment. Cell phone adoption has been in high-growth mode in the emerging markets. Smartphones are changing the video dynamics.
So, will applications require 10K more transistors by 2018? And, do we have the necessary design tools? Well, there will likely be a ~10K increase in transistors over the next eight years, going up to 40 billion transistors by 2018. Therefore, the industry will require tools ready now in order to design for 2018.
Four principal areas will require 10X improvements in design methodologies — system level design, verification, embedded software development, and back-end physical design and test. A 10X increase in the number of transistors will also require 1000X increase in verification.
In summary, reduction in costs per functionality will continue on a predictable learning curve long after Moore’s law is obsolete. The industry will also witness ~10X increase in transistors over the next eight years, leading up to 40 billion transistors by 2018.

Global semicon industry on rapid recovery curve: Dr. Wally Rhines

January 11, 2010
Pradeep Chakraborty Comments off




Dr Walden C. Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics Corp.
Thanks to Mentor’s Raghu Panicker and Veeresh Shetty, I had the pleasure of an exclusive meeting with Dr. Walden (Wally) Rhines, chairman and CEO, Mentor Graphics, post his technical keynote at the recently held VLSID 2010.
We discussed a range of issues, such as the global semiconductor and EDA industries, as well as the Indian industry.
Global semicon industry
According to Dr. Rhines, the global semiconductor industry is currently on a rapid recovery curve. However, that the semiconductor total available market (TAM) would decline in 2009 due to the weakness of H1-09.
He added that the global semiconductor industry’s growth could even be as much as 22 percent during 2010, as also advised by Malcolm Penn of Future Horizons. This number can definitely change, rather than remain so optimistically high, as the year goes by. (Yes, Malcolm’s an optimist!)
Dr.  Rhines said, “If you look at the major semiconductor companies, most of them will have an opportunity to grow — after the Q4 results are in.”
On the global EDA industry
So how will all of this contribute to the well being of the global EDA industry?
According to Dr. Rhines, the EDA industry has been a little different. Mentor and Synopsys have probably had more growth and stability. “Mentor could be the only company to grow. Bookings in Q3-09 have grown by 15 percent and revenue by 3 percent. We are perhaps the only major EDA company that has grown,” he said. In the long term, EDA tends to trend with semiconductor R&D. Semiconductor R&D was flat in 2008, down in 2009, and will probably grow in 2010. So, EDA will probably lag in 2010.”
Advise for Indian semicon industry
I also requested Dr. Rhines to advise the Indian semiconductor industry.
He said: “The Indian semiconductor industry needs to look at more of systems and IC design, as well as embedded software development. India should also have more product start-ups. What makes India unique is its talent, education, etc. India is now producing its own electronic design architecture and embedded software, and it also has the systems infrastructure. India can greatly advance what it already does so well.”
Commenting on the industry’s weaknesses, he added that the Indian semiconductor industry needs to increase the infrastructure for its local start-ups. That infrastructure would require things such as VCs and especially, a cultural acceptance of failure. Also, if India does not have the intrinsic semiconductor manufacturing capability, then it needs to stay current on the evolving technologies.
Does India need a fab?
On being asked this question, Dr. Rhines’ reply was immediate: “I don’t think India ever needed a fab! You can easily have closer relationships with other fabs. The highest paying jobs are design and innovation, etc.. The recession has been driving down costs and innovation has been happening. There are big growing markets — in India and Asia.”

Rhines Named IEEE FellowPR NewswireJanuary 17, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareWILSONVILLE, Ore., Jan.17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mentor Graphics Corporation (MENT) today announced that company chairman and CEO Dr. Walden C. Rhines has been named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Dr. Rhines is being recognized for leadership and technology innovation in integrated circuit design and automation.View photosThe IEEE Grade of Fellow is conferred by the IEEE Board of Directors upon a person with an outstanding record of accomplishments in any of the IEEE fields of interest. The total number selected in any one year cannot exceed one-tenth of one percent of the total voting membership. IEEE Fellow is the highest grade of membership and is recognized by the technical community as a prestigious honor and an important career achievement.During Dr. Rhines' tenure at Mentor Graphics, revenue has nearly quadrupled, enterprise value increased by 8X and Mentor has grown the industry's number one market share solutions in four of the ten largest product segments of the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. At Mentor Graphics, he has built leading industry positions in areas outside of traditional EDA, including system design, embedded software, automotive and hardware emulation. This has led to innovation and growth of the entire EDA industry.Prior to joining Mentor Graphics, Rhines was executive vice president of Texas Instruments (TI) Semiconductor Group, sharing responsibility for TI's Components Sector, and having direct responsibility for the entire semiconductor business with more than $5 billion of revenue and over 30,000 people.During his 21 years at TI, Rhines managed TI's thrust into digital signal processing and supervised that business from inception with the TMS 320 family of DSPs through growth to become the cornerstone of TI's semiconductor technology. He also supervised the development of the first TI speech synthesis devices (used in "Speak & Spell") and is co-inventor of the GaN blue-violet light emitting diode (now important for DVD players and low energy lighting). He was president of TI's Data Systems Group and held numerous other semiconductor executive management positions.Dr. Rhines received the 2015 Phil Kaufman Award for Distinguished Contributions to EDA, presented by the Electronic System Design Alliance (ESDA), formerly the Electronic Design Automation Consortium, and the IEEE Council on EDA (CEDA). The award honors individuals who have had demonstrable impact on the field of EDA through technology innovations, education/mentoring, or business or industry leadership. Dr. Rhines was recognized for growing the EDA and integrated circuit (IC) design industries through his efforts as a leading voice of EDA and for pioneering the evolution of IC design to system-on-chip (SoC) design.Rhines has served five terms as ESDA chairman and is currently serving as a director. He is also a board member of the Semiconductor Research Corporation. He has previously served as chairman of the Semiconductor Technical Advisory Committee of the Department of Commerce and as a board member of the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers' Association (CBEMA), SEMI-Sematech/SISA, University of Michigan National Advisory Council, Lewis and Clark College and SEMATECH.Read MoreDr. Rhines holds a Bachelor of Science degree in metallurgical engineering from the University of Michigan, a Master of Science and Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from Stanford University, a master of business administration from Southern Methodist University and Honorary Doctor of Technology degrees from the University of Florida and Nottingham Trent University.About IEEEThe IEEE is the world's leading professional association for advancing technology for humanity.

Mentor Graphics CEO Walden C. Rhines Named IEEE Fellow


WILSONVILLE, Ore., Jan.17, 2017—Mentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ: MENT) today announced that company chairman and CEO Dr. Walden C. Rhines has been named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Dr. Rhines is being recognized for leadership and technology innovation in integrated circuit design and automation.
The IEEE Grade of Fellow is conferred by the IEEE Board of Directors upon a person with an outstanding record of accomplishments in any of the IEEE fields of interest. The total number selected in any one year cannot exceed one-tenth of one- percent of the total voting membership. IEEE Fellow is the highest grade of membership and is recognized by the technical community as a prestigious honor and an important career achievement.
During Dr. Rhines’ tenure at Mentor Graphics, revenue has nearly quadrupled, enterprise value increased by 8X and Mentor has grown the industry’s number one market share solutions in four of the ten largest product segments of the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. At Mentor Graphics, he has built leading industry positions in areas outside of traditional EDA, including system design, embedded software, automotive and hardware emulation. This has led to innovation and growth of the entire EDA industry.
Prior to joining Mentor Graphics, Rhines was executive vice president of Texas Instruments (TI) Semiconductor Group, sharing responsibility for TI’s Components Sector, and having direct responsibility for the entire semiconductor business with more than $5 billion of revenue and over 30,000 people.
During his 21 years at TI, Rhines managed TI’s thrust into digital signal processing and supervised that business from inception with the TMS 320 family of DSPs through growth to become the cornerstone of TI’s semiconductor technology. He also supervised the development of the first TI speech synthesis devices (used in “Speak & Spell”) and is co-inventor of the GaN blue-violet light emitting diode (now important for DVD players and low energy lighting). He was president of TI’s Data Systems Group and held numerous other semiconductor executive management positions.
Dr. Rhines received the 2015 Phil Kaufman Award for Distinguished Contributions to EDA, presented by the Electronic System Design Alliance (ESDA), formerly the Electronic Design Automation Consortium, and the IEEE Council on EDA (CEDA). The award honors individuals who have had demonstrable impact on the field of EDA through technology innovations, education/mentoring, or business or industry leadership. Dr. Rhines was recognized for growing the EDA and integrated circuit (IC) design industries through his efforts as a leading voice of EDA and for pioneering the evolution of IC design to system-on-chip (SoC) design.
Rhines has served five terms as ESDA chairman and is currently serving as a director. He is also a board member of the Semiconductor Research Corporation. He has previously served as chairman of the Semiconductor Technical Advisory Committee of the Department of Commerce and as a board member of the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers' Association (CBEMA), SEMI-Sematech/SISA, University of Michigan National Advisory Council, Lewis and Clark College and SEMATECH.
Dr. Rhines holds a Bachelor of Science degree in metallurgical engineering from the University of Michigan, a Master of Science and Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from Stanford University, a master of business administration from Southern Methodist University and Honorary Doctor of Technology degrees from the University of Florida and Nottingham Trent University.
