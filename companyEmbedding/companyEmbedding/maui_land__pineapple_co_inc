Maui Land & Pineapple Company: History

	    1918.













































 Maui Land & Pineapple Company’s origins are intimately connected to Maui’s Baldwin family. Reverend Dr. Dwight Baldwin and his wife Charlotte came to Lahaina in the mid-1830s as missionaries and lived in what remains today as the Baldwin Home Museum. Their sons, Henry Perrine Baldwin and David Dwight Baldwin, laid the foundation for the company in the late 1800s through the acquisition of land.

        circa 1946.


Pineapple Beginnings
The Baldwin family’s experimentation with hala kahiki, or pineapple, began in 1890, when the first fruit was planted in Ha‘iku on Maui’s northeastern shore. In 1903 the Baldwin brothers formed Haiku Fruit & Packing Company, launching the pineapple industry on Maui. 
                                    In 1909 Keahua Ranch Company was established. The company’s name was later changed to Haleakala Pineapple Company and eventually to Maui Pineapple Company, Ltd. in 1932. In West Maui, the Baldwin Family holdings dedicated to raising cattle and food crops was called Honolua Ranch. Manager David T. Fleming added pineapple to the operations in 1912 and by 1920 the name was changed to Baldwin Packers, which canned and sold pineapple under its own labels, while growing it at Honolua Plantation. 
                              By 1923, Baldwin Packers owned and managed over 22,000 acres of agricultural land in West Maui. The Baldwins’ east and west Maui holdings and pineapple operations were united in 1962, when Baldwin Packers merged with Maui Pineapple Company. In 1969, Maui Land & Pineapple Company, Inc. (ML&P) was created and went public.
Vision of a Resort
ML&P’s first president and CEO, Colin Cameron, set about making his vision of a master planned resort community a reality when Kapalua Land Company (KLC) was formed in 1974 and some of the company’s agricultural land was rezoned for resort development. He envisioned a resort that co-existed in harmony with its natural environment as a sanctuary for both man and nature.
                                  KLC helped ML&P diversify its business with the successful operation of the Kapalua Resort community. By 1978, the resort was welcoming guests and Honolua and Mokule‘ia Bays were declared a Marine Life Conservation District. In the late 70s, KLC also began the development and sale of luxury condominiums in conjunction with its renowned golf courses and tennis club.
                              ML&P further formalized its commitment to the environment with the 1988 dedication of 8,304 acres of land, including Pu‘u Kukui, summit of Mauna Kahalawai (West Maui mountains), to conservation. The Pu‘u Kukui Watershed Preserve remains the largest privately owned nature preserve in the state. 
A New Century
      In 1992, The Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua opened, having been moved inland after initial excavation unearthed an ancient Hawaiian burial ground. The area fronting the hotel and ocean is now a perpetual easement known as the Honokahua Preservation Site. This wahi pana (sacred site) serves as a reminder of the host culture and long history in the area now called Kapalua. 
      Throughout the 90s, luxury homesites were developed within Kapalua Resort, including the Plantation Estates, Coconut Grove and Pineapple Hill Estates. With the arrival of the 21st century came the renaissance of Kapalua Resort during which new amenities were added to enhance the active, eco-sensitive lifestyles of its guests and residents.
      As ML&P enters its second century of business on Maui, it remains dedicated to the people and places of Hawai‘i Nei.

Aloha, Pine
When Maui Land & Pineapple Company stopped planting fruit last December, it looked like the end of an era—and an island way of life.

0 555 



Story by Jill Engledown
Pineapple was plentiful when I passed through Kahului Airport in mid-December. A Hawaiian-style Santa beckoned from colorful boxes stacked outside shops, inviting passersby to pick up some Maui Gold for the trip home. So it was a bit of a shock when, returning to Maui just after Christmas, I hit the farmers’ market and found no pineapple on display. Only days earlier, Maui Land & Pineapple Company had ceased its harvest. Though in fact pineapple was still available in some stores, its absence from the farmers’ market was a sad reminder that a crop was disappearing. Suddenly the future of agriculture on Maui looked a lot less sweet.
It’s hard to imagine Maui without pineapple: the orderly silver-green rows of spiky tops stretched across acres, the dusty laborers in sunny fields, the luscious golden fruit. How many kids paid for college by working summers in the cannery? How many generations earned a decent living growing pine, and climbed from immigrant beginnings to middle class?
From Elvis Presley’s “Pineapple Princess” to the poolside cocktail in a scooped-out pineapple, the fruit is an international symbol of Hawai‘i. Here in the Islands, even Hawai‘i’s liquid sunshine—sprinkles of rain on a sunny day—is known as “pineapple juice,” and the baby born unexpectedly to middle-aged parents is a “ratoon crop,” the bonus fruit that grows after a plant’s initial harvest.
The announcement last November that ML&P would shut down its pineapple operations was the final blow in a series of misfortunes that have overtaken the company in the past two decades. It’s not easy in the first place to grow a commercial crop in isolated Hawai‘i, where land, water and other agricultural necessities are expensive, and high wages and good benefits make agricultural workers some of the best paid in the world.
But Hawai‘i’s pineapple industry really began to founder in the early 1990s, when foreign producers “dumped” fruit on American markets at less than their own cost of production. Maui Pine faced that challenge as it struggled to carry on after the sudden death of CEO Colin Cameron in 1992. By 1999, the company begun by Baldwins and carried on by their descendants, the Camerons, looked to AOL founder Steve Case, a Honolulu native whose family had done business with theirs for generations, to rescue it from a financial crunch.
Managers installed by Case took the company on new paths they hoped would lead to bigger profits. But last November, with all the Camerons off the board of directors, with the cannery closed, hundreds laid off, and the company gasping for air, the new management announced that it would cease planting pineapple. It looked like the end of a century-long tradition, until some longtime employees pulled together resources and expertise to lease land and purchase equipment from ML&P to start a new company.
It is too early to say how well their Hali‘imaile Pineapple Company will succeed. In any case, this turning point for the old Maui Land & Pineapple Company symbolizes the end not only of a business, but of a way of life.
Pineapple has been a commercial crop on Maui for more than a century. David Dwight Baldwin planted it in Upcountry Ha‘iku as early as 1890. The crop proved a success, and in 1912 the Baldwins began planting at their Honolua Ranch on West Maui.
By 1924, Upcountry pineapple operations were fruitful enough that the family established Hali‘imaile, below Makawao, as a center of pine production, and built a village of about 120 cottages there, all with electric lights and running water at a time when many of the older sugar-plantation camps were still relatively primitive. The new village had its own sewage disposal system, and there was a store, stable, garage, blacksmith shop, repair shop, dispensary, warehouse and office.
In 1925, Harry Baldwin’s daughter, Frances, married J. Walter Cameron, and Baldwin turned over management of the pineapple division to his new son-in-law. It was, J. Walter’s daughter Mary Cameron Sanford remembered recently, “a little experimental company” at the time. A Bostonian whose background was in newspaper advertising, Cameron knew nothing about pineapple, but hired others who did and built the company into one of the island’s largest employers.
Plantations were the economic engine of the early twentieth century, with sugar and pineapple not only the main employers, but also major sources of infrastructure for the community. Workers lived near each other, shared lunches in the fields, and socialized at company parties. “Everybody was invited, including the lunas [managers] and top brass, and everybody went,” recalls Sanford, who grew up attending such parties and receiving medical care at the company dispensary.
The workers themselves organized cultural clubs and sports teams, using the gym, playing fields and other facilities supplied by the company. Executives mingled with and listened to mid-level shop workers; ambitious employees took night courses to improve their skills and came up with ideas that made the plantation more efficient.
Eddie Ceballos looks back fondly at fifty years of working for Maui Land & Pineapple. “I grew up in Hali‘imaile,” he says, with a father who retired from the company after thirty-two years. Eddie started as a water boy; by the time he retired, he was in charge of the construction shop. Ceballos’s daughter worked at Hali‘imaile during the summers.
“The company took care of the employees,” Ceballos says, supplying homes, free water, free kerosene and diesel for water heaters and free medical care. In J. Walter Cameron’s day, “They knew the worker by name, not by number. Mr. Cameron always would think about the community. He always would take care of the people below him. Management had a good team. They were community people. Everybody knew everybody. That’s what made the company strong.”
Pineapple work was hard, whether in the fields or the cannery, and it bred a work ethic in youngsters who, in many cases, headed for higher education just to ensure that they did not have to spend their adult years where they had spent their teenage summers. They took with them values gained in plantation life, such as an awareness of other cultures that resulted in ethnic tolerance. Many looked back with nostalgia on the shared experience of community life in plantation camps like Hali‘imaile and Honolua as they moved to a more urban lifestyle.
Meanwhile, Maui Pine itself was changing. In 1962, the Honolua plantation (known as Baldwin Packers) had merged with Hali‘imaile’s plantation as Maui Pineapple Company. In 1965, Hali‘imaile village was subdivided, its lots sold to employees, and the dispensary closed. That same year, 565 acres of West Maui land were reclassified from agriculture to urban, as J. Walter’s son, Colin Cameron, began the process of converting Honolua’s former pineapple camp to a high-end resort that would be called Kapalua. Its symbol: a pineapple with butterfly’s wings. The resort would make the company, renamed Maui Land & Pineapple, a leader in Maui’s new visitor industry.
“Hawai‘i without pineapple would be like New Zealand without sheep.”
Yet pineapple remained the core of the business for years to come, despite falling revenues. Retired chief agronomist Doug MacCluer, a member of the group that started the new Hali‘imaile Pineapple Company, says he remembers the peak years, when some 2,000 workers in field and cannery handled a harvest of 250,000 tons a year, grown on more than 7,000 acres. Pineapple’s image lent a tropical romance to restaurant names, community festivals and aloha-shirt designs; its sweetness flavored jams and syrups, its fruit was featured on menus from Kona to Hanalei. Local businesses shipped thousands of pineapples each week to individual mainland customers, and the Kahului Cannery filled millions of cans with fruit and juice.
One surprising pine product started as practice, when Tedeschi Vineyards at ‘Ulupalakua Ranch used the fruit in its wine making while its first grapevines matured. The resulting pineapple wine became the winery’s biggest seller, a mainstay that keeps the company in the black. The fact that this fruit is grown on Maui is important, and not just because it would cost more to import pineapple, says Tedeschi president Paula Hegele. “Our industry is about where this fruit was grown,” whether it’s grapes or pineapple that make up the base of a wine.
Like other small farm, Tedeschi is helped, Hegele says, by the very existence of big ag producers, who have the personnel to sit on boards of professional associations and the funds to help support group advertising. Big farmers bring in container loads of farm supplies that keep costs low for the little guys as well.
The potential loss of a vital raw material was one reason ‘Ulupalakua Ranch owner C. Pardee Erdman decided to invest in the effort by several longtime Maui Pine managers to rescue pineapple operations Upcountry. “We started to be concerned about where we’d get our pineapple juice” for the winery, he says.
But it’s more than that. ML&P “was one of the great ag companies of the world,” developing the sweet, low-acid Maui Gold, and the partners in the new company are  “some of the best brains” in pineapple cultivation, Erdman says. “We’ve got a great product. And Hawai‘i without pineapple would be like New Zealand without sheep.”
So as the new year began, and the new Hali‘imaile Pineapple Company picked up where Maui Pine left off, it looked as if pineapple would be around, after all. That was good news to a lot of people, including those, like me, who just want to keep eating the fruit that’s been called the best pineapple in the world.
All in the Family
Maui Land & Pineapple Company was a family affair from the beginning. Dwight David Baldwin, son of Lahaina missionaries Dr. Dwight and Charlotte Baldwin, first grew the fruit at the family home in Lahaina, then experimented with different varieties when he moved to Ha‘iku. In 1903, his brother Henry Perrine Baldwin founded Ha‘iku Fruit & Packing Company, whose initial pack was 1,400 cases of canned pineapple.
Henry’s son Harry saw the potential for pineapple production on land not suitable for other crops, and set up pineapple divisions in agricultural companies owned by the family on the slopes of Haleakala. Over time, the East Maui pineapple divisions merged operations to become Maui Pineapple Company.
Manager David T. Fleming also planted pine at another Baldwin property on West Maui, Honolua Ranch, whose pineapple plantation was later named Baldwin Packers. In 1962, after merging with Maui Pineapple Company, Baldwin Packers closed its Lahaina cannery. The company’s Kahului cannery handled all processing until its canned-fruit production ended in 2007.

Real Estate Giant Trying To Close On New Breakout
On Monday, global real estate services leader CBRE (CBG) received an upgrade to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating, from 67 to 73.

Organization[edit]
Maui Land & Pineapple Company was structured into three operating segments, but re-organized into two at the end of 2009. The Resort segment includes the operation of the golf and vacation resort community, Kapalua Resort, and is managed through the Kapalua Land Company. The Community Development segment involves management of all the company's real estate development, construction, entitlements, sales and leasing activities as well as the operation of Kapalua Realty, a general brokerage real estate company, located in Kapalua Resort.
Kapalua Land Company[edit]
Kapalua Land Company, Ltd. (KLC) operates the Kapalua Resort of 1,650 acres (6.7 km2), along with the development and sale of real estate on the resort. KLC was established in 1975 and manages resort holdings of over 800 residences, homesites and condominiums, golf courses, tennis courts, a spa, retail and pro shops. Kapalua Resort hosts the PGA Tour’s season-opening Hyundai Tournament every January.
Real estate[edit]
The Community Development division manages and develops ML&P’s land holdings. This includes the company’s real estate development, construction, entitlements, sales and leasing activities as well as the operation of Kapalua Realty and Kapalua Water Company, a Public Utilities Commission-regulated water system and sewage transmission operations that services Kapalua Resort in West Maui.
ML&P’s projects are focused on the luxury real estate market within the Kapalua Resort. This includes completed projects of Honolua Village Center, Kapalua Coastal Trail, Kapalua Spa and The Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences at Kapalua Bay. The Community Development division is also planning the affordable and moderately priced residential and mixed use communities of Pulelehua in West Maui and the expansion of Haliʻimaile in the "Upcountry" area of Maui known as Kula.
Maui Pineapple Company[edit]
Maui Pineapple Company, Ltd. (MPC) was the United States' largest grower of Hawaiian pineapples. MPC began in 1909 as the Keahua Ranch Company, Ltd, and became the Maui Pineapple Company in 1932 . MPC cultivated and processed approximately 2,000 acres (8.1 km2) of a hybrid variety of pineapple known as "Maui Gold." It operated Kapalua Farms, located near Kapalua Resort, which cultivates Kapalua Gold and Kapalua Emerald organic pineapples and Kapalua Natural transitional pineapples. Kapalua Farms operates Pineapple Farm Tours in West Maui and manages an organic diversified farming operation.[1]
History[edit]
Company history started in 1903 with Henry Perrine Baldwin and David Dwight Baldwin, sons of medical missionary Rev. Dwight Baldwin. The family acquired land in East and West Maui, and over the next 100 years (how and from whom?), they began ranching and their primary business of cultivating pineapples. The family expanded their land holdings, owning 22,600 acres (91 km2) of land on Maui island by 1933. In 1969, Maui Land & Pineapple Company, Inc. was created by combining Alexander & Baldwin and J. Walter Cameron family holdings and went public. Colin Campbell Cameron, a fifth-generation descendant of the Baldwin family, became its first president and CEO until his death in 1992.[2][3] Harry Weinberg became an investor, but the Cameron family prevented him from getting a board seat.[4]
In 1975 ML&P incorporated Kapalua Land Company, Ltd. as its subsidiary dedicated to resort development. Maui Pineapple Company, Ltd. was established as its subsidiary devoted to pineapple and other agricultural operations. In 1975 the company opened its first golf course. Two other golf courses, homes, luxury condos, and another hotel (The Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua) followed over the next two decades. In 1978, ML&P dedicated 3,307 acres (13.38 km2) of coastal land to establish the Honolua-Mokule'ia Marine Life Conservation District. In 1988, ML&P committed 8,304 acres (33.61 km2) of its West Maui land, including Puʻu Kukui, the summit of the West Maui mountain range, to conservation. This area eventually became the Puʻu Kukui Watershed Preserve, one of the largest private nature preserves in Hawaii. In 1989 hundreds of remains of ancient Hawaiians were discovered when excavating for a new hotel.[5]
Colin Cameron's son Richard Cameron (born circa 1955) served as executive and chairman when the pineapple cannery (the last in the United States) shut down, and only fresh fruit was marketed.[6] When Weinberg died and the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation inherited his stock shares, lawyer Daniel H. Case arranged a sale of the shares to keep the company intact.[7] Gary L. Gifford announced he would resign May 27, 2003, and was temporarily replaced by Donald Young. A shopping center in Kahului was sold later that year.[8]
Former AOL executive Steve Case (Daniel Case's son) became an investor in 1999 buying the former Weinberg stake,[9] and in October 2003 brought in fellow former AOL executive David C. Cole as President and CEO to replace Gifford. Richard Cameron resigned as chairman, and stepped down as director in 2005.[6] Cole started an ambitious expansion program for the resort.[10] The original Kapalua Bay Hotel was torn down in 2006,[11] and replaced by a "club" with memberships reportedly sold for $375,000. After rising fuel costs, a real estate price drop, and reduced tourism caused losses, layoffs were announced in 2008.[12] Case joined the board in 2008 and Cole left at the end of that year.[13]
On December 31, 2009, MPC ceased pineapple operations after 97 years. The move briefly put Maui out of the pineapple business, and left only a small pineapple operation run by Dole Food Company on Oʻahu growing one of Hawaii's signature crops.[14] A group of former Maui Pineapple Company executives and local investors assumed pineapple operations on January 1, 2010. The new company, Haliʻimaile Pineapple Company, Ltd. (HPC), continued to grow and market fresh pineapple under the Maui Gold Brand to the Hawaii market. HPC purchased and licensed key assets, and leased farm land, equipment, and buildings from ML&P.[15][16] The Kapalua Farms organic pineapple operation was taken over by Ulupono Sustainable Agriculture Development, backed by investor Pierre Omidyar in early 2010.[1][17]
In July and August 2010 Case increased his holdings in the company to over 60%, as the company retired some debt.[13] In 2009 the Plantation golf course at Kapalua was sold to TY Management Corporation, and in September 2010 the Kapalua Bay course was sold to the same investors.[18]

Organization[edit]
Maui Land & Pineapple Company was structured into three operating segments, but re-organized into two at the end of 2009. The Resort segment includes the operation of the golf and vacation resort community, Kapalua Resort, and is managed through the Kapalua Land Company. The Community Development segment involves management of all the company's real estate development, construction, entitlements, sales and leasing activities as well as the operation of Kapalua Realty, a general brokerage real estate company, located in Kapalua Resort.
Kapalua Land Company[edit]
Kapalua Land Company, Ltd. (KLC) operates the Kapalua Resort of 1,650 acres (6.7 km2), along with the development and sale of real estate on the resort. KLC was established in 1975 and manages resort holdings of over 800 residences, homesites and condominiums, golf courses, tennis courts, a spa, retail and pro shops. Kapalua Resort hosts the PGA Tour’s season-opening Hyundai Tournament every January.
Real estate[edit]
The Community Development division manages and develops ML&P’s land holdings. This includes the company’s real estate development, construction, entitlements, sales and leasing activities as well as the operation of Kapalua Realty and Kapalua Water Company, a Public Utilities Commission-regulated water system and sewage transmission operations that services Kapalua Resort in West Maui.
ML&P’s projects are focused on the luxury real estate market within the Kapalua Resort. This includes completed projects of Honolua Village Center, Kapalua Coastal Trail, Kapalua Spa and The Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences at Kapalua Bay. The Community Development division is also planning the affordable and moderately priced residential and mixed use communities of Pulelehua in West Maui and the expansion of Haliʻimaile in the "Upcountry" area of Maui known as Kula.
Maui Pineapple Company[edit]
Maui Pineapple Company, Ltd. (MPC) was the United States' largest grower of Hawaiian pineapples. MPC began in 1909 as the Keahua Ranch Company, Ltd, and became the Maui Pineapple Company in 1932 . MPC cultivated and processed approximately 2,000 acres (8.1 km2) of a hybrid variety of pineapple known as "Maui Gold." It operated Kapalua Farms, located near Kapalua Resort, which cultivates Kapalua Gold and Kapalua Emerald organic pineapples and Kapalua Natural transitional pineapples. Kapalua Farms operates Pineapple Farm Tours in West Maui and manages an organic diversified farming operation.[1]
History[edit]
Company history started in 1903 with Henry Perrine Baldwin and David Dwight Baldwin, sons of medical missionary Rev. Dwight Baldwin. The family acquired land in East and West Maui, and over the next 100 years (how and from whom?), they began ranching and their primary business of cultivating pineapples. The family expanded their land holdings, owning 22,600 acres (91 km2) of land on Maui island by 1933. In 1969, Maui Land & Pineapple Company, Inc. was created by combining Alexander & Baldwin and J. Walter Cameron family holdings and went public. Colin Campbell Cameron, a fifth-generation descendant of the Baldwin family, became its first president and CEO until his death in 1992.[2][3] Harry Weinberg became an investor, but the Cameron family prevented him from getting a board seat.[4]
In 1975 ML&P incorporated Kapalua Land Company, Ltd. as its subsidiary dedicated to resort development. Maui Pineapple Company, Ltd. was established as its subsidiary devoted to pineapple and other agricultural operations. In 1975 the company opened its first golf course. Two other golf courses, homes, luxury condos, and another hotel (The Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua) followed over the next two decades. In 1978, ML&P dedicated 3,307 acres (13.38 km2) of coastal land to establish the Honolua-Mokule'ia Marine Life Conservation District. In 1988, ML&P committed 8,304 acres (33.61 km2) of its West Maui land, including Puʻu Kukui, the summit of the West Maui mountain range, to conservation. This area eventually became the Puʻu Kukui Watershed Preserve, one of the largest private nature preserves in Hawaii. In 1989 hundreds of remains of ancient Hawaiians were discovered when excavating for a new hotel.[5]
Colin Cameron's son Richard Cameron (born circa 1955) served as executive and chairman when the pineapple cannery (the last in the United States) shut down, and only fresh fruit was marketed.[6] When Weinberg died and the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation inherited his stock shares, lawyer Daniel H. Case arranged a sale of the shares to keep the company intact.[7] Gary L. Gifford announced he would resign May 27, 2003, and was temporarily replaced by Donald Young. A shopping center in Kahului was sold later that year.[8]
Former AOL executive Steve Case (Daniel Case's son) became an investor in 1999 buying the former Weinberg stake,[9] and in October 2003 brought in fellow former AOL executive David C. Cole as President and CEO to replace Gifford. Richard Cameron resigned as chairman, and stepped down as director in 2005.[6] Cole started an ambitious expansion program for the resort.[10] The original Kapalua Bay Hotel was torn down in 2006,[11] and replaced by a "club" with memberships reportedly sold for $375,000. After rising fuel costs, a real estate price drop, and reduced tourism caused losses, layoffs were announced in 2008.[12] Case joined the board in 2008 and Cole left at the end of that year.[13]
On December 31, 2009, MPC ceased pineapple operations after 97 years. The move briefly put Maui out of the pineapple business, and left only a small pineapple operation run by Dole Food Company on Oʻahu growing one of Hawaii's signature crops.[14] A group of former Maui Pineapple Company executives and local investors assumed pineapple operations on January 1, 2010. The new company, Haliʻimaile Pineapple Company, Ltd. (HPC), continued to grow and market fresh pineapple under the Maui Gold Brand to the Hawaii market. HPC purchased and licensed key assets, and leased farm land, equipment, and buildings from ML&P.[15][16] The Kapalua Farms organic pineapple operation was taken over by Ulupono Sustainable Agriculture Development, backed by investor Pierre Omidyar in early 2010.[1][17]
In July and August 2010 Case increased his holdings in the company to over 60%, as the company retired some debt.[13] In 2009 the Plantation golf course at Kapalua was sold to TY Management Corporation, and in September 2010 the Kapalua Bay course was sold to the same investors.[18]

The Community Development segment involves management of all the company's real estate development, construction, entitlements, sales and leasing activities as well as the operation of Kapalua Realty, a general brokerage real estate company, located in Kapalua Resort.
Kapalua Land Company[edit]
Kapalua Land Company, Ltd. (KLC) operates the Kapalua Resort of 1,650 acres (6.7 km2), along with the development and sale of real estate on the resort. KLC was established in 1975 and manages resort holdings of over 800 residences, homesites and condominiums, golf courses, tennis courts, a spa, retail and pro shops. Kapalua Resort hosts the PGA Tour’s season-opening Hyundai Tournament every January.
Real estate[edit]
The Community Development division manages and develops ML&P’s land holdings. This includes the company’s real estate development, construction, entitlements, sales and leasing activities as well as the operation of Kapalua Realty and Kapalua Water Company, a Public Utilities Commission-regulated water system and sewage transmission operations that services Kapalua Resort in West Maui.
ML&P’s projects are focused on the luxury real estate market within the Kapalua Resort. This includes completed projects of Honolua Village Center, Kapalua Coastal Trail, Kapalua Spa and The Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences at Kapalua Bay. The Community Development division is also planning the affordable and moderately priced residential and mixed use communities of Pulelehua in West Maui and the expansion of Haliʻimaile in the "Upcountry" area of Maui known as Kula.
Maui Pineapple Company[edit]
Maui Pineapple Company, Ltd. (MPC) was the United States' largest grower of Hawaiian pineapples. MPC began in 1909 as the Keahua Ranch Company, Ltd, and became the Maui Pineapple Company in 1932 . MPC cultivated and processed approximately 2,000 acres (8.1 km2) of a hybrid variety of pineapple known as "Maui Gold." It operated Kapalua Farms, located near Kapalua Resort, which cultivates Kapalua Gold and Kapalua Emerald organic pineapples and Kapalua Natural transitional pineapples. Kapalua Farms operates Pineapple Farm Tours in West Maui and manages an organic diversified farming operation.[1]
History[edit]
Company history started in 1903 with Henry Perrine Baldwin and David Dwight Baldwin, sons of medical missionary Rev. Dwight Baldwin. The family acquired land in East and West Maui, and over the next 100 years (how and from whom?), they began ranching and their primary business of cultivating pineapples. The family expanded their land holdings, owning 22,600 acres (91 km2) of land on Maui island by 1933. In 1969, Maui Land & Pineapple Company, Inc. was created by combining Alexander & Baldwin and J. Walter Cameron family holdings and went public. Colin Campbell Cameron, a fifth-generation descendant of the Baldwin family, became its first president and CEO until his death in 1992.[2][3] Harry Weinberg became an investor, but the Cameron family prevented him from getting a board seat.[4]
In 1975 ML&P incorporated Kapalua Land Company, Ltd. as its subsidiary dedicated to resort development. Maui Pineapple Company, Ltd. was established as its subsidiary devoted to pineapple and other agricultural operations. In 1975 the company opened its first golf course. Two other golf courses, homes, luxury condos, and another hotel (The Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua) followed over the next two decades. In 1978, ML&P dedicated 3,307 acres (13.38 km2) of coastal land to establish the Honolua-Mokule'ia Marine Life Conservation District. In 1988, ML&P committed 8,304 acres (33.61 km2) of its West Maui land, including Puʻu Kukui, the summit of the West Maui mountain range, to conservation. This area eventually became the Puʻu Kukui Watershed Preserve, one of the largest private nature preserves in Hawaii.

A shopping center in Kahului was sold later that year.[8]
Former AOL executive Steve Case (Daniel Case's son) became an investor in 1999 buying the former Weinberg stake,[9] and in October 2003 brought in fellow former AOL executive David C. Cole as President and CEO to replace Gifford. Richard Cameron resigned as chairman, and stepped down as director in 2005.[6] Cole started an ambitious expansion program for the resort.[10] The original Kapalua Bay Hotel was torn down in 2006,[11] and replaced by a "club" with memberships reportedly sold for $375,000. After rising fuel costs, a real estate price drop, and reduced tourism caused losses, layoffs were announced in 2008.[12] Case joined the board in 2008 and Cole left at the end of that year.[13]

The new company, Haliʻimaile Pineapple Company, Ltd. (HPC), continued to grow and market fresh pineapple under the Maui Gold Brand to the Hawaii market. HPC purchased and licensed key assets, and leased farm land, equipment, and buildings from ML&P.[15][16] The Kapalua Farms organic pineapple operation was taken over by Ulupono Sustainable Agriculture Development, backed by investor Pierre Omidyar in early 2010.[1][17]
In July and August 2010 Case increased his holdings in the company to over 60%, as the company retired some debt.[13] In 2009 the Plantation golf course at Kapalua was sold to TY Management Corporation, and in September 2010 the Kapalua Bay course was sold to the same investors.[18]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.43      Net Money Flow ($)  -709,457    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
