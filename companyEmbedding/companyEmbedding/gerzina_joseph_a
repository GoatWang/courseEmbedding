FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Foreign waters

By: Kristen Hampshire |  12:00am EDT July 27, 2008 






In today’s global marketplace, U.S. companies are doing business with more foreign customers who are reeling from the strength of their own currency relative to
the U.S. dollar. As businesses here capture
foreign demand for U.S. goods and services
 now more affordable for overseas companies than ever before  they may confront payment and financing issues. 
There is inevitable risk associated with
overseas sales. Primarily, not getting paid, but
also, securing the financing to produce the
products to make the sale in the first place.
Trade financing addresses both concerns. 
“Any company that exports overseas is a
candidate for trade financing,” says Joseph
Gerzina, senior vice president, regional manager for the Akron/Canton region commercial banking group of Huntington Bank. 
Smart Business spoke with Gerzina about
trade financing and how it can help U.S. businesses prosper in a world economy. 
What exactly is trade finance?
There are two parts to trade finance: credit
and structured payment. The credit helps
companies acquire and manufacture goods
to sell when domestic funding sources are
either insufficient or unavailable. A U.S. company can obtain trade finance credit to start
and complete a transaction. The structured
payment assures that the company gets paid
via documentary credits or collections that
are dispatched through secure global banking communication networks. 
What businesses are prime candidates for
trade finance?
Any company engaged in buying and selling raw material, semifinished or finished
goods, both internationally and domestically,
can utilize trade finance. For instance, a U.S.
company receives a product order from a foreign customer, but it has never done business
with this customer before and, therefore, has
no proof that the customer will pay or pay on
time. In this case, the trade finance arrangement involves getting an Export Letter of
Credit or Standby Letter of Credit from the
foreign customer’s bank. An Export Letter of
Credit is a standardized conditional promise
to pay the seller when goods are delivered in compliance with the terms and conditions. A
Standby Letter of Credit is more along the
lines of a performance guarantee. 
A business is also a candidate for trade
finance if a foreign customer places a large
order and the U.S. company does not have
the liquidity to produce the products to fulfill
that order and get paid. Trade finance
involves the lender securing short-term payment guarantees via Banker Acceptances
with an ‘Aval’ (guarantee) from the foreign
bank or Bankers Acceptances created under
an Export Letter of Credit or Credit
Insurance provided by the private insurance
market or insurance or credit guarantees
obtained from the Export-Import Bank of the
United States (Ex-Im Bank). Essentially, by
seeking outside payment guarantees, the
loan repayment risk is shifted to an investment grade foreign bank or insurance company or, as in the case of the Ex-Im Bank of
the United States, the federal government. 
What are the terms of a trade finance
arrangement?
Trade finance loan structures are usually
six months or less and utilize the buyer’s or
the buyer’s bank’s promise to pay, credit insurance to cover foreign receivables or
credit guarantees from the Ex-Im Bank.
These are means of collateral or guarantee
that the loan used to fund the export transaction will be repaid. The Ex-Im bank provides
participating U.S. financial institutions with
different types of credit guarantees, helping
shift the risk of nonpayment away from the
foreign or domestic buyer to the U.S. government instead. Trade finance loans are short-term ‘bridges’ to help U.S. companies do
business overseas with minimal risk. 
Why should an owner utilize trade finance
rather than commercial finance?
Commercial loan structures are used to
fund the day-to-day operations of a company
or to purchase equipment and property. They
are longer-term and require a lot of collateral.
The problem is, some companies that do
business overseas have significant foreign
accounts receivables, which are typically not
sufficient collateral for U.S. banks. Trade
finance utilizes a secure promise to pay from
a third party. In the case of credit guarantees
from the Ex-Im Bank, generous advance
rates against ‘WIP,’ Raw Materials, Finished
Goods or Foreign Accounts Receivable can
be obtained. If there is a default on payment,
which would lead to a default on the loan, the
Ex-Im bank will ‘make good’ on the loan.
What questions will a trade finance officer
ask an owner before facilitating the loan?
First, the bank will determine all risk factors that underlie potential payment default.
The bank will want to know what country
the buyer is in. The bank’s knowledge of legal
and banking systems in your buyer’s country
will help identify political or economic factors that contribute to the risk of nonpayment. Your bank will also figure out the financial capability of the buyer and its bank so
you can get paid and pay back the trade credit. Refusal by the buyer’s bank to guarantee
payment via Letter of Credit or otherwise is a
big red flag. You’ll also have to prove that
your company has requisite funding available
to sell the product.
