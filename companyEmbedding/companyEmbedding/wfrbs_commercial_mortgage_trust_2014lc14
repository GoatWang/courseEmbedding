Fitch Affirms WFRBS Trust 2014-LC14 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms WFRBS Trust 2014-LC14
    





February 11, 2015 05:35 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 17 classes of WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      2014-LC14 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. The Rating 
      Outlook for all classes remains Stable. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to the overall stable performance of the 
      underlying collateral pool. Fitch reviewed the most recently available 
      financial performance data for the transaction, as well as updated rent 
      rolls for the top 15 loans, which represent 59.4% of the transaction. Of 
      the loans in the pool, 71.1% reported 3Q'14 financials, 6.5% reported 
      2Q'14 financials, and 18.5% reported year-end (YE) 2013 financials,
    

      As of the January 2015 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 0.6% to $1,246.3 million from $1,255.6 
      million at issuance. Currently there are no delinquent or specially 
      serviced loans. Fitch has designated two loans (1.4%) as Fitch Loans of 
      Concern (LOC), one of which is also reported on the servicer Watchlist. 
      The Fitch LOCs reported third quarter (3Q) 2014 debt service coverage 
      ratio (DSCR) below 1.00x.
    

      The largest loan in the pool, AmericasMart (11% of the pool), is a 
      10-year amortizing balloon loan. The whole loan consists of four pari 
      passu notes with a total current balance of $548.8 million, amortizing 
      from $560 million at issuance. Only the A3 note is included in the 
      trust. Located in the CBD of Atlanta, GA, the collateral is a 7.1 
      million square foot (sf) wholesale trade market that caters to a variety 
      of retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers that engage in wholesale 
      trade. With approximately 4.6 million sf of rentable area in four 
      attached buildings, 3.5 million sf of which is permanent space. The 1.1 
      million sf of temporary exhibition space can be leased during trade 
      shows. The loan is sponsored by AMC Inc. The servicer reported occupancy 
      for the permanent space as of January 2014 was 88.1%, compared to 85% at 
      UW. The loan is performing in line with issuer underwriting expectations.
    

      The second largest loan, The PennCap Portfolio (7.2%), is a 10-year term 
      partial interest-only loan (i.e. interest-only for the initial 24 
      months). The whole loan consists of two pari passu notes totaling $138.6 
      million. Only the A1 note is included in the trust. The collateral 
      consists of 32 properties located within five different 
      office/industrial parks in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania. The 
      combined properties represent 1,432,661 sf of office and 
      office/industrial flex space. The properties are currently occupied over 
      100 tenants across a wide variety of industries. Sponsored by PennCap 
      Properties, the loan is performing in line with issuer underwriting 
      expectations. As of September 2014, the portfolio was 91.9% occupied, 
      compared to 91.3% at UW. Servicer reported 3Q 2014 DSCR was 1.41x, 
      compared to 1.54x at issuance.
    

      The third largest loan, The Outlet Collection/Jersey Gardens (6.4%), is 
      a six year term interest-only loan. The whole loan consists of three 
      pari passu notes totaling $350 million. Only the A3 note is included in 
      the trust. The collateral is a 1.3 million sf outlet mall located in 
      Elizabeth, NJ, which is 17 miles southwest of New York City. The mall 
      includes over 200 tenants, consisting of manufacturer outlets, discount 
      off-price stores, full-price retailers, restaurants and entertainment 
      venues. The property is anchored by Loews Theaters (8.5% of NRA with 22 
      screens), Burlington Coat Factory (6.2%), Forever 21 (4.5%), Cohoes 
      Fashions (4.5%), Marshalls (3.8%) and Bed Bath and Beyond (3.2%). 
      Glimcher Properties was the original loan sponsor. As of January 2015 
      there is a new sponsor in conjunction with the Glimcher and Washington 
      Prime merger. The loan is performing in line with issuer underwriting 
      expectations. As of December 2014, the property was 99.6% occupied, 
      compared to 99.4% at UW. Servicer reported 3Q'14 DSCR was 2.96x, 
      unchanged from UW.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset-level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. 
      Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 
      'Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust, Series 2014-LC14' (January 28, 
      2014) at www.fitchratings.com.
    

      Fitch affirms the following:
    

      --$56.9 million Class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$189.7 million Class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$80 million Class A-3FL at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$0 Class A-3FX at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$175 million Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$278.5 million Class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$89.5 million Class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$95.7 million Class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$81.6 million Class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47.1 million Class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class PEX Exchangeable Certificates at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$64.3 million Class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22 million Class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$12.6 million Class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest - Only Class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest - Only Class X-B at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch does not rate the IO class X-C or the class G. A comparison of the 
      transaction's Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement (RW&E) 
      mechanisms to those of typical RW&Es for the asset class is available in 
      the following report:
    

      --Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust Series 2014-LC14 Representations

on Feb 13, 2015 Affirmed Aaa (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.




The rating on the IO class was affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.8% 
of the current balance, compared to 3.0% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.8% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 3.0% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A RATINGS UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to 
Rating US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 28, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the October 15, 2015 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1% to $1.24 
billion from $1.26 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 71 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 11% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 49% of the pool. Two loans, constituting 
11% of the pool, have investment-grade structured 
credit assessments.




Ten loans, constituting 17% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's received full year 2014 operating results for 88% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2015 operating results for 95%. 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 104%, compared 
to 105% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with credit assessments, defeased and CTL 
loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 11.5% 
to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 10%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.45X and 1.06X, 
respectively, compared to 1.44X and 1.05X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The first loan with a structured credit assessment is the Outlet Collection 
-- Jersey Gardens Loan ($80 million -- 
6% of the pool), which is secured by an approximately 1.3 
million square foot (SF) regional outlet center mall located in Elizabeth, 
NJ. As of March 2015, the property was 94% occupied, 
compared to nearly 100% as of June 2014. The loan represents 
an $80 million pari passu portion of a total $350 million, 
and the other loan pieces are in WFRBS 2013-C18 and WFRBS 2013-UBS1. 
Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed DSCR are baa3 (sca.pd) 
and 1.16X, respectively, the same as at the last review.




The second loan with a structured credit assessment is the Westin New 
York at Times Square -- Leased Fee Loan ($55 million 
-- 4% of the pool), which is secured by the 
ground lease under the Westin New York at Times Square hotel in New York, 
NY. The loan is interest-only for the term of the loan, 
and has an Anticipated Repayment Date (ARD) on February 2019. Moody's 
structured credit assessment and stressed DSCR are a2 (sca.pd) 
and 0.70X, respectively, the same at the last review.




The top three conduit loans represent 22% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the AmericasMart Loan ($135 million -- 
11% of the pool), which is secured by an approximately 4.6 
million SF wholesale trade mart center located in Atlanta, GA. 
The collateral includes four buildings built between 1961 and 2008. 
The loan represents a $135 million pari passu portion of a total 
$543 million that also has portions within WFRBS 2013-C18, 
MSBAM 2014-C14 and MSBAM 2014-C15. Moody's LTV and 
stressed DSCR are 94% and 1.27X, respectively, 
compared to 97% and 1.23X at the last review.




The second largest loan is the PennCap Portfolio ($90 million -- 
7% of the pool), which is secured by 17 suburban office and 
15 suburban industrial properties across five business parks within the 
greater Lehigh Valley, PA area totaling approximately 1.4 
million SF. The portfolio was 92% occupied as of September 
2014, compared to 90% as of September 2013. The loan 
represents a $90 million pari passu portion of a total $123.7 
million that also has a pari passu piece within COMM 2014-LC15. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 112% and 0.98X, 
respectively, the same as at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Miami International Airport Industrial Portfolio 
($47 million -- 4% of the pool), which 
is secured by eleven single-story industrial and showroom buildings 
contained within two industrial business parks in Miami, FL. 
The portfolio was 93% leased as of June 2015, compared to 
89% as of September 2014. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 116% and 0.93X, respectively, compared to 
117% and 0.92X at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on ten P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.




The rating on Class PEX was affirmed due to the credit performance (or 
the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of its exchangeable classes.




The rating on the IO class, Class X-A, was affirmed 
based on the credit performance (or the weighted average rating factor 
or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 3.4% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.8% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 3.3% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.8% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at 


http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 28, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the September 16th, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 3% to $1.22 
billion from $1.26 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 71 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 11% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 49% of the pool. Two loans, constituting 
11% of the pool, have investment-grade structured 
credit assessments.




Fourteen loans, constituting 17% of the pool, are on 
the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool. One loan, constituting 
1% of the pool, is currently in special servicing. 
The sole specially serviced loan is the Westridge Apartments Loan ($11.4 
million -- 0.9% of the pool), which 
is secured by a 96-unit multifamily property located in Williston, 
North Dakota, an area with high levels of oil-related employment. 
The property's occupancy had drop approximately 25% from the first 
quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. The borrower has 
fallen behind payments for May and June and the loan transferred to special 
servicing in June 2016. The special servicer continues to dual 
track settlement discussion and foreclosure. Moody's estimates 
a significant loss for the specially serviced loan.




Moody's received full or partial year 2015 operating results for 100% 
of the pool, and partial year 2016 operating results for 72% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 104%, 
the same as at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 15% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
10.1%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.44X and 1.06X, 
respectively, compared to 1.45X and 1.06X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The largest loan with a structured credit assessment is the Outlet Collection 
| Jersey Gardens Loan ($80 million -- 6.5% of 
the pool), which represents a pari-passu interest in a $350 
million mortgage loan. The loan is secured by a 1.3 million 
square foot (SF) regional outlet center mall located in Elizabeth, 
New Jersey. In 2013 the sponsor invested $30 million for 
renovations to the corridors, entrances, restrooms and food 
court. As of June 2016, the property was 96% leased. 
In-line tenant sales for the March 2016 trailing twelve month were 
$863 per square foot (PSF); compared to the March 2015 trailing 
twelve month of $870 per square foot (PSF). Moody's structured 
credit assessment and stressed DSCR are a3 (sca.pd) and 1.16X, 
respectively.




The other loan with a structured credit assessment is the Westin New York 
at Times Square -- Leased Fee Loan ($55 million -- 
4.5% of the pool), which is secured by the ground 
lease under the Westin New York at Times Square hotel in New York City. 
The loan is interest-only for the 5-year period immediately 
prior to the Anticipated Repayment Date (ARD) in February 2019. 
After the ARD, all excess cash flow will be used to amortize the 
loan until final maturity. Moody's structured credit assessment 
is a2 (sca.pd).




The top three conduit loans represent 22% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the AmericasMart Loan ($133 million -- 
11% of the pool), which is secured by an approximately 4.6 
million SF wholesale trade mart center located in Atlanta, Georgia. 
The collateral includes four buildings built between 1961 and 2008. 
The loan represents a pari passu portion of a total $530 million 
mortgage loan that also has portions within WFRBS 2013-C18, 
MSBAM 2014-C14 and MSBAM 2014-C15. Moody's LTV and 
stressed DSCR are 91% and 1.30X, respectively, 
compared to 93.5% and 1.27X at the last review.




The second largest loan is the PennCap Portfolio Loan ($86 million 
-- 7% of the pool), which is secured by 17 
suburban office and 15 suburban industrial properties across five business 
parks within the greater Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania. The 
properties total approximately 1.4 million square feet and the 
portfolio was 90% occupied as of December 2015, compared 
to 92% occupied as of September 2014. The loan represents 
a pari passu portion of a total $119.3 million mortgage 
loan that also has a pari passu piece within COMM 2014-LC15. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 107% and 1.03X, 
respectively, compared to 112% and 0.98X at the last 
review.




The third largest loan is the Miami International Airport Industrial Portfolio 
($46 million -- 4% of the pool), which 
is secured by 11 single-story industrial and showroom buildings 
contained within two industrial business parks in Miami, Florida. 
The portfolio was 94% leased as of June 2016, compared to 
93% leased as of June 2015. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 114% and 0.95X, respectively, compared to 
116% and 0.93X at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation

are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their

For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The rating on the IO class was affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 3.0% 
of the current balance. Moody's base expected loss plus realized 
losses is now 3.0% of the original pooled balance. 
Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit 
and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 28, 
the same as at securitization.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the January 16, 2015 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1% to $1.25 
billion from $1.26 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 71 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 11% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 49% of the pool. Two loans, constituting 
11% of the pool, have investment-grade structured 
credit assessments.




Three loans, constituting 4% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's received partial year 2014 operating results for 89% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 105%, 
compared to 106% at securitization. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 6% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
10%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.44X and 1.05X, 
respectively, compared to 1.45X and 1.05X at securitization. 
Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's 
actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.

REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party 
assessment on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments related to the monitoring of this transaction 
in the past six months.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Announcement: Moody's: No rating impact on 30 CMBS transactions in which Deutsche Bank serves as Trustee or Certificate Administrator






                    Global Credit Research - 30 Jul 2015
                









New York, July 30, 2015 -- On May 28, 2015, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") upgraded 
both Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("DBTCA") and Deutsche 
Bank National Trust Company ("DBNTC") and their operating 
trust company subsidiaries' long-term bank deposit ratings to A1 
from A3 and upgraded their short-term bank deposit ratings to P-1 
from P-2. The long-term issuer ratings for both DBTCA 
and DBNTC were downgraded to Baa1 from A3 and the Counter Party Risk Assessment 
("CRA") is A2(cr) / P-1(cr). DBTCA and DBNTC 
(collectively, "DB") have submitted a request for Rating Agency 
Confirmation ("RAC") with respect to 30 transactions for which DB serves 
as trustee and / or certificate administrator for Moody's consideration.




In the event that DB's ratings fail to meet Moody's criteria, 
DB's proposal includes the following features: 




(1) For those transactions in which DB serves as nominal trustee with 
the obligation to back-up the Master Servicer with respect to debt 
service and property protection advances: a) DB may serve in this 
capacity as long as it maintains a minimum long-term issuer rating 
of Baa2 and the Master Servicer for the transaction maintains a minimum 
long-term issuer rating of A2; b) If the Master Servicer is 
not rated, or its long-term issuer rating is lower than A2 
and DB's long-term issuer rating is lower than Baa2, 
then DB will resign as trustee within 30 days of the master servicer or 
DB both failing to meet the A2 long-term issuer rating threshold 
and be replaced by a successor trustee with a minimum long-term 
issuer rating of A2.




(2) For those transactions in which DB serves as Certificate Administrator, 
DB may serve in this capacity as long as it maintains a minimum long-term 
issuer rating of Baa2. However, if: a) DB holds distribution 
or collection account funds intraday and only intraday, those funds 
must be held in a depository institution with a minimum long-term 
bank deposit rating of Baa2 or short-term bank deposit rating of 
P-2; or b) DB holds distribution or collection account funds 
overnight or longer, those funds must be held in a depository institution 
that has a minimum long-term deposit rating of A2 or short-term 
deposit rating of P-1.




In assessing the proposal, Moody's has considered the rating implementation 
guidance entitled "The Temporary Use of Cash in Structured Finance Transactions: 
Eligible Investment and Bank Guidelines" published in March 16, 
2015. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this rating implementation guidance.




Moody's opinion only addresses the credit impact associated with the proposal. 
Moody's is not expressing any opinion as to whether this change has, 
or could have, other noncredit related effects that may have a detrimental 
impact on the interests of note holders and/or counterparties.




Moody's will continue to monitor these ratings. Any change in the 
ratings will be publicly disseminated by Moody's through appropriate media








This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For 
any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
