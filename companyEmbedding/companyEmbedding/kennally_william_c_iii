From 2001 to 2009, Mr. Kennally was President of Greenstone, LLC, a generic and authorized generic pharmaceutical supplier which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc. after Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia. Mr. Kennally started his professional career in Sales with the Upjohn Company, which was later acquired by Pharmacia, and followed a Pharmaceutical Sales Career pathway that included front line management and a corporate office position as Sales Incentive Compensation Manager. Mr. Kennally graduated from St. Anselm College with a B.S. in Criminal Justice. We believe that Mr. Kennally's deep, multi-faceted experience in pharmaceutical sales, general management, and business leadership gained over a 37-year distinguished career, and in particular his knowledge and experience in the generic pharmaceutical business, gives him the qualifications and skills to serve as one of our directors.
