Risk Disclosure 


Value Partners Taiwan Fund (The “Fund”) invests primarily in companies established in Taiwan or which derive a majority of their revenue from business related to Taiwan.
The Fund may invest in Taiwan and therefore is subject to emerging market risks. Generally, investments in emerging markets are more volatile than investments in developed markets due to additional risks relating to political, social, economic and regulatory uncertainty which may adversely affect volatility and market liquidity.
The Fund is also subject to concentration risk due to its concentration in Taiwan-related companies. Adverse development in such region may affect the value of the underlying securities in which the Fund invests. The value of the Fund can be extremely volatile and could go down substantially within a short period of time. It is possible that the entire value of your investment could be lost.
The Fund may also invest in derivatives which can involve material risks, e.g. counterparty default risk, insolvency or liquidity risk, and may expose the Fund to significant losses.
You should not make investment decision on the basis of this material alone. Please read the explanatory memorandum for details and risk factors.

The FSA Spy market buzz - 28 July 2017


More News



 The transaction amount was not disclosed.
Aberdeen will merge the acquisition with its existing Taiwan business, Aberdeen International Securities Investment Consulting Company, set up a decade ago. It currently only allows the firm to distribute Luxembourg funds domestically.
“The significance of this deal is not so much about what we are buying now as what it will allow us to do in the future”, which is to “introduce new asset strategies and broaden distribution via onshore funds and segregated mandates”, said Michelle Maa, general manager of Aberdeen’s Taiwan operations, in a statement.
The onshore platform allows the firm to launch Taiwan-domiciled funds and be more flexible on product design to cater the needs of local investors, a spokeswoman for Aberdeen said. It also brings a discretionary mandate license.
Aberdeen sells 26 offshore funds in Taiwan, and most of them are equity focused. The firm aims to develop locally-domiciled multi-asset funds, which “may be of particular interest to insurance and other institutions seeking outcome-orientated solutions”,  according to the statement.

VP Concord was set up by Value Partners in 2011. The other major shareholder is Taiwan-based Concord Securities Group.
It now manages one locally-domiciled fund, the Value Partners Concord Greater China Value Fund with NT$125m ($4.1m) of assets under management as of the end of May.
“The existing fund that VP Concord has will be under evaluation by Aberdeen’s investment team. Upon local regulatory approval, we will be disclosing more details,” the spokeswoman added.
A Value Partners spokeswoman said the firm “will continue to work with its business partners in Taiwan to distribute its funds through private placement and offshore platforms.
“Value Partners remains positive on the growth prospect of Taiwan’s domestic economy and fund management market,” she said.
Domestic domicile
Taiwan’s regulator, the Financial Supervisory Commission, has been tightening rules on distributing funds offshore in the past few years. The regulator has limited assets allowed to be raised onshore and restricted the types of funds that can be registered. It has also encouraged fund houses to launch domestically-domiciled funds.
In Taiwan, total assets in offshore funds stood at around $103bn as of the end of March, accounting for 46% of Taiwan’s $224bn fund management industry. Onshore fund assets account for just 30% of the industry, and the remaining assets are managed by discretionary mandates, as reported earlier.
Aberdeen is in the process of merging with Standard Life Investments, which is expected to be completed August 14. SLI does not have presence in Taiwan.

 Details of the acquisition were not disclosed.
Aberdeen will merge the acquisition with its existing Taiwan business, Aberdeen International Securities Investment Consulting Company, set up a decade ago.
It is currently only able to distribute Luxembourg funds domestically.
“The significance of this deal is not so much about what we are buying now as what it will allow us to do in the future, [which is] introduce new asset strategies and broaden distribution via onshore funds and segregated mandates,” said Michelle Maa, general manager of Aberdeen’s Taiwan operations.
Locally domiciled
The onshore platform allows the firm to launch Taiwan-domiciled funds and be more flexible on product design to cater the needs of local investors, a spokeswoman for Aberdeen said.

Aberdeen sells 26 offshore funds in Taiwan, and most of them are equity focused.
The firm aims to develop locally-domiciled multi-asset funds, which “may be of particular interest to insurance and other institutions seeking outcome-orientated solutions”, the company said.
Value Partners
VP Concord was set up by Value Partners in 2011. The other major shareholder is Taiwan-based Concord Securities Group.
It now manages one locally-domiciled fund, the Value Partners Concord Greater China Value Fund with TW$125m (£3.2m, $4.1m, €3.6m) of assets under management as of the end of May.
“The existing fund that VP Concord has will be under evaluation by Aberdeen’s investment team. Upon local regulatory approval, we will be disclosing more details,” a Vaue Partners spokeswoman said.
She added that the firm “will continue to work with its business partners in Taiwan to distribute its funds through private placement and offshore platforms".
“Value Partners remains positive on the growth prospect of Taiwan’s domestic economy and fund management market."
