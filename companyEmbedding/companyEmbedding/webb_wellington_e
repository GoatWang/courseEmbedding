Wellington E. Webb (born February 17, 1941) is an American politician. He served as the first African American Mayor of Denver, Colorado. The Webb family relocated from Chicago to the Northeast section of Denver in August 1954, where the imposing six-foot, five-inch youth became active in sports. He is a graduate of the city's Manual High School. Webb was an all-conference basketball player at Northeastern Junior College in Sterling, Colorado, in 1960. He obtained his B.A. in sociology from Colorado State College in 1964 and his M.A. in sociology from the same school, now known as the University of Northern Colorado, in 1971.
He is married to Wilma Webb, and they have four children.
Webb is the former president of the Democratic Mayors and the past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and National Conference of Black Mayors. He lectures frequently on civic issues and was a guest lecturer at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Webb collaborates closely with his wife, former Colorado State Representative Wilma J. Webb.
In 2001, Webb served on the selection committee for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.[1]
Politics[edit]

In 1972, Webb was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives, representing his boyhood home in northeast Denver. In 1977, Webb was selected by President Jimmy Carter to serve as regional director of the U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare. In 1981, Colorado Governor Richard Lamm appointed Webb to his cabinet as executive director of the Department of Regulatory Agencies. Webb was elected Denver city auditor in 1987, and served until 1991.
Wellington Webb's 1991 bid for mayor included his "Sneaker Campaign", in which he walked door to door through a large portion of Denver, introducing himself as a relatively unknown candidate.
Webb served as mayor of Denver for 12 years, from 1991 to 2003. One highlight of his years in office was the South Platte River Corridor Project, involving commercial and residential redevelopment, as well as reclamation of park land, along the South Platte River in central Denver. He was also mayor at the time of the completion of Denver International Airport, started by his precessor, Federico Peña.

In his three terms as mayor of Denver, Webb focused on four major areas: parks and open space, public safety, economic development and children. Accomplishments during his administration include a record 40 percent decrease in crime since 1991 as unemployment dipped below 2 percent.[citation needed] Webb's development projects include the new Denver International Airport, a new sports stadium, expansion of the Denver Art Museum and a new African American Research Library.
Webb was mentioned in the documentary Bowling for Columbine during a speech by National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. In April 1999, shortly after the high school shootings at Columbine High School near Denver, Heston claimed that Webb had asked him not to come to Denver.
Although he briefly sought the office of chairman of the Democratic National Committee in late 2004, Webb dropped out of the race in late January 2005 and endorsed fellow candidate Howard Dean, who went on to win the chairmanship. Webb was well known as the only African-American candidate for the DNC chairmanship.
The Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building, completed in Fall 2002, was named in honor of Webb. It houses some forty municipal agencies and divisions from the City and County of Denver, as well as the office of the District Attorney.
In February 2007, Webb published his autobiography, The Man, the Mayor and the Making of Modern Denver (Fulcrum Publishing), co-written by former Colorado journalist Cindy Brovsky.
In 2008, Webb supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden as one of Colorado's presidential electors.[2]

Wellington E. Webb - BiographyWellington Webb spent 12 years as the leader of Denver's Mile High City, and helped drag it out of the economic doldrums of 1991 to an investment of $7 billion in infrastructure when he left office in 2003. 
In October 2003, he founded Webb Group International. The firm works with businesses and cities on economic development projects, public relations and other consulting areas. His clients include Parsons Transportation; the American Beverage Association; Hudson News; and Boulder Apps.
 
Wellington Webb serves on the board of directors of the Maximus Corporation, MALDEF (Mexican American Legal Defense Fund) and is the President & CEO of the Colorado Black Chamber of Commerce Foundation. He was appointed by President Obama to serve on the FirstNet Board of Directors.  He is a member of the Denver Rotary, a 33rd Degree Mason and a member of Kappa Alpha Psi and Sigma Pi Phi fraternities.
As mayor, he oversaw the completion of $4 billion Denver International Airport and redevelopment of the former Stapleton Airport into a thriving residential and business area. He also helped convince voters to approve a $300 million addition to the Colorado Convention Center, which opened December 2004, and pushed through difficult negotiations for a nearby privately-publicly funded Hyatt Convention Center hotel which opened in 2005.
Among his goals was the redevelopment of the industrial Central Platte Valley near downtown Denver. The area once littered by abandoned rail lines now boasts a privately-funded Pepsi Center (professional basketball, hockey and entertainment venue), relocation of Six Flags Elitch Gardens (amusement park), a community gardens and acres of city parks along the South Platte River. He also pushed for the successful transformation of lower downtown into a vital business and residential area anchored by the professional baseball ball park, Coors Field. In addition, he made sure that Denver's professional athletic teams -- the Denver Broncos, the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche -- signed agreements to play in the city for at least 25 years and relocate to venues within the downtown area.
His social agenda included convincing the city to create Denver Health Medical Authority in 1997, which eliminated a cash deficit of $39 million and has been rated one of the top public hospitals in the U.S. The mayor led the campaign for nearly $290 million in voter approved bonds for improvements to the hospital and property. He also added more than 2,000 acres of new parks and open space to the city _ the largest addition of park land by any mayor in Denver's history. Voters also approved $96 million for neighborhood and park improvements; and $125 million for a major expansion of the Denver Art Museum and improvements to the Denver Zoo.
The city also took advantage of good economic times to invest in a new $200 million city office building, which citizens pushed to be named after the mayor; and a $16 million African American research library -- the only such facility west of the Mississippi River. His negotiating skills included getting four new airline routes to serve Denver: British Airways, Lufthansa German Airlines, Mexicana Airlines, Korean Airlines. He looked to stimulate Denver's economy by opening foreign trade offices in London, England and Shanghai, China, and leading U.S. Conference of Mayors missions to Africa and Colorado trade missions to China and Japan.Denver is the only city to be cited for five consecutive years as "One of the Top American Cities" in Fortune Magazine's annual "Best Cities" survey. The city also was named "One of the Top Three Cities for Sound Fiscal Management" by City and State Magazine; "One of the Top American Cities" by Money Magazine; and ''Top city for Entrepreneurs'' by Entrepreneur Magazine.
As a statesman, Webb hosted Pope John Paul II and nearly 200,000 people worldwide for World Youth Day in 1993. Four years later, he welcomed President Clinton and eight world leaders at the Denver Summit of the Eight, the annual local economic summit. His numerous recognitions include, the U.S. Conference of Mayors highest honor, the Distinguished Public Service award in ; The Americans for the Arts Government Leadership in the Arts; The National Wildlife Federation's Achievement Award; The National Trust for Historic Preservation's ''Outstanding Achievement in Public Policy'' award; and by the country of France the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur (Chevalier of the Legion Honor). Webb is the only Mayor in U.S. history to serve as President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, President of the National Conference of Black Mayors, and President of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors. 
Prior to being elected mayor, he served in the Colorado State Legislature; was appointed a Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under President Jimmy Carter; was appointed Executive Director of Colorado's Department of Regulatory Agencies under Governor Richard Lamm; and was elected Denver's city Auditor.  His first career was as a faculty member for the University of Colorado and Colorado State University.  Wellington Webb is married to former six-term State Representative Wilma J. Webb and they have four grown children; Keith, Stephanie, Anthony and Allen.[Printer friendly page | Send to a friend]

Webb Group International - Project Consulting 




Wellington E. Webb, Denver's former mayor, founded Webb Group International in October 2003 to offer his experience and expertise to cities and businesses. 
While in office from 1991 to July 2003, he oversaw an investment of $7 billion in infrastructure. Those projects included the $4 billion Denver International Airport and redevelopment of former Stapleton Airport into a thriving residential/business community. 
He convinced voters to approve a $300 million expansion to the Colorado Convention Center, which opened in December 2004, and led tough, successful negotiations for a nearby hotel. The mayor strongly supported the revitalization of the Mile High City's downtown, which has become a model nationwide. 





  Wellington E. Webb Municipal BuildingDenver, Colorado


The preservation of historic buildings were remodeled into lofts, offices, restaurants and bars along with the anchors of the Denver for the Performing Arts and Coors Field. In addition, the nearby Central Platte Valley -- once an abandoned rail yard -- was renewed with acres of park land along the South Platte River and the construction of the Pepsi Center and Six Flags Elitch Gardens.
The mayor also looked internationally to stimulate Denver's economy by opening foreign trade offices in London, England and Shanghai, China.


"As a former mayor, I recognize and have personally encountered the wide array of issues you are faced with daily. I possess a unique mayoral perspective in assisting you with the challenges ahead, as well as knowing how to seize the opportunity presented within those challenges." - Wellington E. Webb

Wellington Webb was born in Chicago in 1941.  He came to Denver at a very early age and before entering politics he was a forklift operator. Webb’s public service career began in 1972 when he was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives. In 1977, he was selected by President James Carter to serve as regional director of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Then in 1981, Colorado Governor Richard Lamm appointed Webb to his cabinet as Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. In 1987, he was elected as the Denver City Auditor. 


In 1991, Webb became the first African American mayor of Denver.  He won reelection twice, serving a total of twelve years. During his tenure he named the first Hispanic police chief, the first African American fire chief and the first Hispanic Clerk and Recorder.  He also oversaw the construction of Denver International Airport and ensured that many of its concessions would be operated b women and minority entrepreneurs.  Mayor Webb hosted nearly 200,000 people from around the world to celebrate World Youth Day with Pope John Paul II on August 11-15, 1993, and in 1997 welcomed President Clinton and eight world leaders at the Denver Summit of the Eight, the annual economic summit. 


A new city office building was named the Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building in 2002 just before he left office. In addition, Denver Health and Hospitals named their primary care facility in his honor in 2006.  Since leaving office, former Mayor Webb has partnered with a real estate developer to build affordable housing.

The Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building is a beacon at 
              the center of the City governmental heartbeat. The philosophy behind 
              its origin was to create a central location for over 50 City agencies. 
              Ultimately, this provides the taxpayers a means to efficiently conduct 
              business with a range of city departments and agencies. Currently 
              the building is occupied by the City Auditor�s office, the District 
              Attorneys office, Public Works, Planning and Development, and the 
              Department of Economic Development to name a few.
The ownership of The Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building is
unique in that it was developed for the City and County of Denver by
Mile High Development LLC and owned by a non-profit entity,  CCOB,
Inc. which was formed by Mile High,  and leased to the City for 25 years. 
In addition to the obvious benefit to provide public access to the most
frequently visited agencies, the Webb building has pushed the envelope
in municipal architecture.  The buildings uniqueness is rooted in its
whimsical incorporation of art on each level.  Creative artists from around
the country partnered with the City  to successfully blend sculpture,
paint, and metal work to create a vibrant blend of form and function.

The 704,000 sqft, Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building houses
over 1,800 employees from 52 agencies and subagencies of the City and
County of Denver.
The building is a 12-story office tower with 571 underground parking
spaces and 100 bike lockers and includes renovation of the 88,000 square
foot Annex building. Building exterior is limestone and granite with high
performance, low-E curtainwall glazing. Interior is granite, wood
paneling, and carpet accents, dramatic lighting with permanent and
changing art and civic exhibits. The building is also LEED certified.
Mile High Development managed the design build process, installation
of $10 million of FF&E and the move management of 1860 City
employees and equipment into this facility.

Wellington E. Webb (born February 17, 1941) is an American politician. He served as the first African American Mayor of Denver, Colorado. The Webb family relocated from Chicago to the Northeast section of Denver in August 1954, where the imposing six-foot, five-inch youth became active in sports. He is a graduate of the city's Manual High School. Webb was an all-conference basketball player at Northeastern Junior College in Sterling, Colorado, in 1960. He obtained his B.A. in sociology from Colorado State College in 1964 and his M.A. in sociology from the same school, now known as the University of Northern Colorado, in 1971.
He is married to Wilma Webb, and they have four children.
Webb is the former president of the Democratic Mayors and the past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and National Conference of Black Mayors. He lectures frequently on civic issues and was a guest lecturer at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Webb collaborates closely with his wife, former Colorado State Representative Wilma J. Webb.
In 2001, Webb served on the selection committee for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.[1]
Politics[edit]




Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building


In 1972, Webb was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives, representing his boyhood home in northeast Denver. In 1977, Webb was selected by President Jimmy Carter to serve as regional director of the U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare. In 1981, Colorado Governor Richard Lamm appointed Webb to his cabinet as executive director of the Department of Regulatory Agencies. Webb was elected Denver city auditor in 1987, and served until 1991.
Wellington Webb's 1991 bid for mayor included his "Sneaker Campaign", in which he walked door to door through a large portion of Denver, introducing himself as a relatively unknown candidate.
Webb served as mayor of Denver for 12 years, from 1991 to 2003. One highlight of his years in office was the South Platte River Corridor Project, involving commercial and residential redevelopment, as well as reclamation of park land, along the South Platte River in central Denver. He was also mayor at the time of the completion of Denver International Airport, started by his precessor, Federico Peña.

In his three terms as mayor of Denver, Webb focused on four major areas: parks and open space, public safety, economic development and children. Accomplishments during his administration include a record 40 percent decrease in crime since 1991 as unemployment dipped below 2 percent.[citation needed] Webb's development projects include the new Denver International Airport, a new sports stadium, expansion of the Denver Art Museum and a new African American Research Library.
Webb was mentioned in the documentary Bowling for Columbine during a speech by National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. In April 1999, shortly after the high school shootings at Columbine High School near Denver, Heston claimed that Webb had asked him not to come to Denver.
Although he briefly sought the office of chairman of the Democratic National Committee in late 2004, Webb dropped out of the race in late January 2005 and endorsed fellow candidate Howard Dean, who went on to win the chairmanship. Webb was well known as the only African-American candidate for the DNC chairmanship.
The Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building, completed in Fall 2002, was named in honor of Webb. It houses some forty municipal agencies and divisions from the City and County of Denver, as well as the office of the District Attorney.
In February 2007, Webb published his autobiography, The Man, the Mayor and the Making of Modern Denver (Fulcrum Publishing), co-written by former Colorado journalist Cindy Brovsky.
In 2008, Webb supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden as one of Colorado's presidential electors.[2]

Wellington E. Webb (born February 17, 1941) is an American politician. He served as the first African American Mayor of Denver, Colorado. The Webb family relocated from Chicago to the Northeast section of Denver in August 1954, where the imposing six-foot, five-inch youth became active in sports. He is a graduate of the city's Manual High School. Webb was an all-conference basketball player at Northeastern Junior College in Sterling, Colorado, in 1960. He obtained his B.A. in sociology from Colorado State College in 1964 and his M.A. in sociology from the same school, now known as the University of Northern Colorado, in 1971.
He is married to Wilma Webb, and they have four children.
Webb is the former president of the Democratic Mayors and the past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and National Conference of Black Mayors. He lectures frequently on civic issues and was a guest lecturer at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Webb collaborates closely with his wife, former Colorado State Representative Wilma J. Webb.
In 2001, Webb served on the selection committee for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.[1]
Politics[edit]




Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building


In 1972, Webb was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives, representing his boyhood home in northeast Denver. In 1977, Webb was selected by President Jimmy Carter to serve as regional director of the U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare. In 1981, Colorado Governor Richard Lamm appointed Webb to his cabinet as executive director of the Department of Regulatory Agencies. Webb was elected Denver city auditor in 1987, and served until 1991.
Wellington Webb's 1991 bid for mayor included his "Sneaker Campaign", in which he walked door to door through a large portion of Denver, introducing himself as a relatively unknown candidate.
Webb served as mayor of Denver for 12 years, from 1991 to 2003. One highlight of his years in office was the South Platte River Corridor Project, involving commercial and residential redevelopment, as well as reclamation of park land, along the South Platte River in central Denver. He was also mayor at the time of the completion of Denver International Airport, started by his precessor, Federico Peña.

In his three terms as mayor of Denver, Webb focused on four major areas: parks and open space, public safety, economic development and children. Accomplishments during his administration include a record 40 percent decrease in crime since 1991 as unemployment dipped below 2 percent.[citation needed] Webb's development projects include the new Denver International Airport, a new sports stadium, expansion of the Denver Art Museum and a new African American Research Library.
Webb was mentioned in the documentary Bowling for Columbine during a speech by National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. In April 1999, shortly after the high school shootings at Columbine High School near Denver, Heston claimed that Webb had asked him not to come to Denver.
Although he briefly sought the office of chairman of the Democratic National Committee in late 2004, Webb dropped out of the race in late January 2005 and endorsed fellow candidate Howard Dean, who went on to win the chairmanship. Webb was well known as the only African-American candidate for the DNC chairmanship.
The Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building, completed in Fall 2002, was named in honor of Webb. It houses some forty municipal agencies and divisions from the City and County of Denver, as well as the office of the District Attorney.
In February 2007, Webb published his autobiography, The Man, the Mayor and the Making of Modern Denver (Fulcrum Publishing), co-written by former Colorado journalist Cindy Brovsky.
In 2008, Webb supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden as one of Colorado's presidential electors.[2]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
