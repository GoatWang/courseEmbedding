This month will make two years that you have been gone. I miss you like crazy.!!! Even tho we were low maintenance friends & wasn't in contact a few years no doubt it was all love. From the first day we met we just clicked and my heart is so heavy I won't be able to ever call 323-752-90** & be on the phone with you for hours talking about any & everything. I will never let go of the feeling of you having your friend come get me and my friends when we didn't have anywhere to go and you sleeping in the car with us. You always made sure I was straight & you were always so gentlemen about it. Sleep in internal Peace my Scorpio love. This does not even feel right writing this & I feel myself getting ready to cry but I'm gone hold it back & smile at one of my favorite memories of us walking to burger king & us laughing about you changing the name to "Baby knock out world" LMAO. See you again I love you!

Hi I knew John when we were in younger and we lost touch because I moved away to Louisiana. I am so hurt to find out this happened to him because I've been trying to find him for years. RIP John

Today has made a year since my brother has been deceased and still there has been no arrest. The lost of my brother still pains each and everyone of us that had a bond with him from family to friends. John you are so truly missed and I just pray that justice will soon be served.
— A sisters love April 23, 2016 at 12:26 a.m.

This whole thing has been so hard on the family. Its crazy how know one is speaking out at all. My nephew loved everyone. He had a big heart and would give you his last. Its hard even writing this comment. I really just pray somebody will say something. Its been months and still no news on who did this horrible thing by taking my loving nephew from the family. But I have faith God knows and God shows. Love you Aunties heart!! Sleep well the family misses you!!!!

@Baltimore...you are absolutely correct.  A lot of times when an officer shoots/kills a black person, the person isn't all goody, goody, two-shoes as people claim, especially family and friends.  And when blacks riot and loot, they destroy entire neighborhoods and business districts.  Then have the audacity to complain that they have nowhere to shop for food and clothing.  Somewhere along the way, they point the finger at the white man, the white race, and white officers instead of looking at their own actions and behavior.  Smdh.
— Ginny June 5, 2015 at 3:06 p.m.


“
To willingly take anyone's life away is horrible. The selfish/cowardly act leaves hurt, grief, and some depression to the family left behind. Cops on black, black on black, bla, bla, bla. Stop the killing period. So easy to say. So impossible to happen it seems. Choose your battles carefully.. Learn to walk with love and with peace. I have high regards for another ones life. I think of my mother, brothers, and sisters and the hurt death could cause. I think of my children loosing me or me loosing them. I think of John. RIP
— I care June 1, 2015 at 7 p.m.

RIP John.  God's got you know.
— lavette bowles May 11, 2015 at 7:49 a.m.


“
@baltimore, couldn't have said it better, it's hard for me to say this but I don't or can't even get upset when someone is killed by the police , there's just too many black on black shootings going on every single day in los angeles and every other inner city acoss america, it makes me upset that people just brush that under the rug.
— that's right April 30, 2015 at 8:01 p.m.


“
Why is it that when a black man kills another black man the community is calm, no one talks everything is ok, but when a police officer kills a black man everyone is  protesting, marching, riots break out and the whole community comes together in up roar, civil unrest in the black community.
—  Baltimore  April 28, 2015 at 10:21 p.m.
