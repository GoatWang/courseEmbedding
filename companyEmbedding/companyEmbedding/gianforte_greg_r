Early life and education[edit]
Gregory Richard Gianforte[7][8] was born to Frank and Dale Gianforte in San Diego, California on April 17, 1961. He is of English, Italian, and Scottish descent.[9][10][11] When he was at a young age, the family moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia, and he graduated from Upper Merion Area High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in 1979.[12] He obtained a B.E. in electrical engineering and an MSc in computer science from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1983.[13]
Career in software[edit]

Gianforte co-founded Brightwork Development Inc., a software company, in 1986; he and his partners sold the company to McAfee Associates for $10 million in 1994.[14] He then moved to Bozeman, Montana.[12]
Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies in 1997. The company went public in 2004 and was sold to Oracle Corporation for $1.5 billion in 2011.[15] Before the sale, RightNow Technologies employed about 500 people at its headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, and over 1000 people in total.[16]
Gianforte is a board member of FICO.[17]
2016 Montana gubernatorial election[edit]

On January 20, 2016, Gianforte announced his candidacy for the Republican Party's nomination for governor of Montana in the 2016 election.[18] He had a political practices complaint filed alleging he started campaigning before registering.[19][20] The complaint was dismissed.[21]
In a campaign speech that year, Gianforte stated that he had been involved in discussions with Facebook about bringing a new call center to Montana, but that Facebook had declined because of that state's business equipment tax.[22] A Facebook spokesman disputed Gianforte's claims, saying that no discussions with Gianforte took place and that the tax was not the reason the company decided not to locate a call center in Montana. Gianforte stood by his statement saying that he had spoken with a Facebook executive the previous fall.[23]
Steve Bullock, the incumbent Democratic governor, defeated Gianforte in the November general election, 50%–46%.[24]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2017[edit]
Main article: Montana's at-large congressional district special election, 2017
On March 1, 2017, Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana's at-large congressional district resigned his seat following his confirmation by the United States Senate as United States Secretary of the Interior. Governor Bullock set a special election to finish Zinke's term for May 25 that same day.[25] Gianforte had already announced his intention to seek the seat on January 25, prior to Zinke's confirmation and subsequent resignation.[26] At a March 6 convention, the Republican Party selected Gianforte as their nominee. He faced Democratic musician and former Montana Arts Council member Rob Quist, as well as Libertarian nominee Mark Wicks, in the general election.[27]
His campaign was supported by Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr., who both stumped for Gianforte in the state.[28][29][30] According to the New York Times, Gianforte has in the 2017 race for Montana's at-large congressional district "hewed particularly close to the president's narrative: He promotes his outsider status (he has never held office) and his business acumen (his software empire, RightNow Technologies, started in a basement), and takes aim at sanctuary states and “the liberal elite” whenever he can."[31]
In financial disclosure forms filed in 2017, Gianforte indicated that he owned $150,000 worth of shares in VanEck Vectors Russia ETF and $92,400 in the IShares MSCF Russia ETF, totalling just under $250,000 in two exchange-traded funds focused on investments in Russia.[32] The investments attracted attention because they included shares in Gazprom and Rosneft, which are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed after the Russian invasion of Crimea; however, because the per-person ownership stake in these companies is so small in such index funds, they are exempt from sanctions.[32] After the issue was raised in Gianforte's 2017 congressional campaign, Gianforte stated that his Russia holdings were a small portion of his overall investments and pledged to place all of his assets in a blind trust if elected.[32][33]
Assault charge[edit]
On May 24, 2017, the day before the U.S. House special election, Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for The Guardian newspaper who was covering the election, said that Gianforte assaulted him.[34][35][36][37] Jacobs said that Gianforte "bodyslammed" him to the floor and broke the reporter's glasses.[34][35][36] The Gianforte campaign was initially unapologetic, blaming the reporter,[38] disputing the allegations, saying that Jacobs grabbed Gianforte's wrist, causing them both to fall to the ground.[39] However, an audio recording of the incident appeared to support Jacobs's statement,[40][34] and other reporters who were present at the scene corroborated Jacobs' version of events.[41]
According to Fox News reporter Alicia Acuna, who witnessed the incident, "Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground," then "began punching the man" and "yelling something to the effect of 'I'm sick and tired of this!'"; Acuna added that Jacobs was not showing "physical aggression" prior to the altercation.[42] Following the incident, Jacobs went to the hospital for x-rays.[40]
Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault by the Gallatin County Sheriff and was ordered to appear in court regarding his actions.[43][44]
Three of Montana's largest newspapers, including the Billings Gazette, the largest in the state, the Missoulian and the Independent Record, all rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte in the wake of the incident.[45][46][47][48] Speaker Paul Ryan and other members of Congress urged Gianforte to apologize.[49]
Gianforte won the special election on May 25. During his acceptance speech that evening, he apologized to Jacobs and the Fox News crew for his assault.[50] On June 7 Gianforte made a written apology to Jacobs and donated US$50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In return, Jacobs agreed to not pursue a civil claim against Gianforte.[51]
On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty and was originally sentenced to four days in jail, to be completed in part through a work program. But he was ineligible for the work program due to the assault conviction. The judge then switched the sentence to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with an $85 court fee.[4][5]
Tenure[edit]
Gianforte was sworn into the U.S. House on June 21, 2017.[52] At his inauguration ceremony, Gianforte announced his support for congressional term limits, barring members of Congress from becoming lobbysts, and holding back congressional pay if no budget is passed – it is unusual for members of Congress to announce such support for legislation in their inauguration.[53] Montana Democrats mailed Gianforte an orange prison jumpsuit at the day of his inauguration.[54][55]
Committee assignments[edit]

Committee on Natural Resources
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Gianforte opposes abortion.[56][57] He believes that abortion should be prohibited except when the woman's life is in danger.[58] Gianforte favors removing federal funds from Planned Parenthood.[58]
The Gianforte Family Foundation was founded to pursue Gianforte's creationist beliefs in the public sphere and to "protect the unborn." The foundation has been a part of anti-abortion campaigns.[59]
Aging and retirement[edit]
Gianforte has outlined his position on retirement by using the Biblical example of Noah. He said:

"There's nothing in the Bible that talks about retirement. And yet it's been an accepted concept in our culture today. Nowhere does it say, 'Well, he was a good and faithful servant, so he went to the beach... The example I think of is Noah. How old was Noah when he built the ark? 600. He wasn't like, cashing Social Security checks, he wasn't hanging out, he was working. So, I think we have an obligation to work. The role we have in work may change over time, but the concept of retirement is not biblical."[60][61][62][63]

Creationism[edit]
Gianforte has expressed support for recent creationism.[64] The Gianforte Family Foundation donated a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton replica to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum in Glendive, Montana.[65]
Donald Trump[edit]
Gianforte distanced himself from Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primary and did not attend his one rally in Montana, citing a scheduling conflict.[66][67] However, he endorsed Trump in the 2016 general election and continued to express support for him during his House campaign.[68][69][70] Gianforte has supported Trump's 2017 hiring freeze,[71] his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey,[72] and Executive Order 13769, which temporarily banned immigration from seven Middle Eastern and predominantly Muslim countries.[73]
Environment and public lands[edit]
Gianforte opposes the sale or transfer of federal land. He has called for changes to the Endangered Species Act.[71] Gianforte has also called for changes to the federal Equal Access to Justice Act to reduce environmental litigation, asserting that the act has been abused by "environmental extremists."[71]
In an April 2017 interview, Gianforte acknowledged human-caused climate change but "did not have specific ideas on how to address climate change."[71] In another April 2017 interview, however, he said that "the climate is always changing," and stated that closing coal-fired power plants would not help mitigate climate change.[74] He supported Trump's repeal of the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration.[75]
Management of public lands was a point of contention in both Gianforte's 2016 campaign for governor[76] and Gianforte's campaign for Congress.[77] In 2009, Gianforte's LLC filed a lawsuit against the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks about the boundaries of an easement for public access to the East Gallatin River.[78] Gianforte's suit against the state became an issue in the 2016 campaign with Gianforte's critics characterizing it as a wealthy out-of-stater's effort to block public access to a popular stream.[76][78][71] Gianforte "has consistently denied the allegations and called the issue a misunderstanding, noting the suit was never served." In any case, the matter was settled.[76] In his 2017 campaign for Congress, Gianforte's campaign spokesperson stated that Gianforte believes that "public lands need to stay in public hands and he opposes efforts to transfer federal lands to the states."[77]
He has called for investments in clean coal technology.[74]
Healthcare[edit]
Gianforte supports repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[79] He has declined to say whether he supports the American Health Care Act, the House Republican legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[80] That same day, Gianforte held a private conference call with Republican-leaning lobbyists in Washington D.C. where he offered a more supportive view of the American Health Care Act.[80][81] He said that it "sounds like we just passed a health care thing, which I'm thankful for, sounds like we're starting to repeal and replace."[80] Later that May, he said he would not "vote for a repeal and a replace unless I know it protects people with pre-existing conditions, lowers rates and preserves rural access".[82]
The incident where Gianforte assaulted a reporter was in response to questions about how the AHCA would make health insurance too expensive for people with pre-existing conditions.[83]
Immigration[edit]
Gianforte opposes sanctuary cities[31] and resettlement of refugees in Montana.[84]
LGBT rights[edit]
Gianforte opposes same-sex marriage,[56] and has stated that he supports government enforcement of nondiscrimination for workers, but not for customers.[85][86] Gianforte has donated to the Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family, which advocates for a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage; and the Montana Family Foundation, which is "the state's primary advocate against LGBT policies".[86]
Marijuana[edit]
Gianforte opposes the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, comparing marijuana to more addictive drugs.[87] He supports allowing the use of medical marijuana to "people in chronic pain, under the care of a doctor."[58]
Minimum wage[edit]
Gianforte opposes increases in the minimum wage, asserting "Legislating higher wages actually reduces employment opportunities for people."[88]
Russia[edit]
Gianforte has blamed the Obama administration for "the situation with Russia" and has stated that: "The US and our allies need to work together on a long-term strategy to stand against Russian aggression in the region and to ensure the sovereignty of our allies is protected."[32]
Gianforte Family Foundation[edit]
In 2004, Gianforte and his wife founded the Gianforte Family Foundation, which has made tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions[89][90] and describes as its primary mission to "support the work of faith-based organizations engaged in outreach work, strengthening families, and helping the needy; organizations in Montana that work to improve education, support entrepreneurship, and create jobs; and organizations that enhance the local community of Bozeman, Montana."[91] He, his wife, and his son are the foundation's three board members.[91] The foundation had assets of $113 million in 2013.[90]
The Gianforte Family Foundation has given nearly $900,000 to the Montana Family Foundation, in some years making up half of the total donations to the Montana Family Foundation. The Montana Family Foundation has promoted conservative and Christian values in the Montana legislature. Asked why he donated to the group, Gianforte said it was because the organization aligns with his views.[92]
Honors[edit]
Gianforte received an honorary doctorate from Stevens Institute of Technology and gave the commencement speech in 2012.[93] In 2007, Gianforte was awarded an honorary doctorate from Montana State University's College of Engineering.[94][7] In 2007, Gianforte was inducted into the CRM Hall of Fame.[95] Gianforte received the 2003 Stevens Institute of Technology's Stevens Honor Award.[96] Gianforte was named Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young in 2003.[97]
Personal life[edit]
Greg and Susan Gianforte married in 1989.[98] They live in Bozeman, Montana and have four children.[99] They attend Grace Bible Church, a nondenominational church in Bozeman. Gianforte is a donor to several Christian and conservative groups.[100][101]
Gianforte believes in Young Earth creationism.[102] belief that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. He has donated at least $290K in cash to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum, a Montana creationist museum which teaches visitors that evolution is false, the Earth is about 6,000-6,400 years old, that dinosaurs were on the Ark and that they likely died out 4,300 years ago during the flood described in the Book of Genesis.[103][104][105]

On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty in court on a charge of misdemeanor assault stemming from his attack on The Guardian political reporter Ben Jacobs. He was sentenced to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with a $85 court fee.[4][5] He had already paid $4464.97 in restitution as part of the criminal case.[6] Gianforte officially assumed office on June 21, 2017.

Early life and education[edit]
Gregory Richard Gianforte[7][8] was born to Frank and Dale Gianforte in San Diego, California on April 17, 1961. He is of English, Italian, and Scottish descent.[9][10][11] When he was at a young age, the family moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia, and he graduated from Upper Merion Area High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in 1979.[12] He obtained a B.E. in electrical engineering and an MSc in computer science from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1983.[13]
Career in software[edit]




Gianforte speaking in 2006


Gianforte co-founded Brightwork Development Inc., a software company, in 1986; he and his partners sold the company to McAfee Associates for $10 million in 1994.[14] He then moved to Bozeman, Montana.[12]
Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies in 1997. The company went public in 2004 and was sold to Oracle Corporation for $1.5 billion in 2011.[15] Before the sale, RightNow Technologies employed about 500 people at its headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, and over 1000 people in total.[16]
Gianforte is a board member of FICO.[17]
2016 Montana gubernatorial election[edit]

On January 20, 2016, Gianforte announced his candidacy for the Republican Party's nomination for governor of Montana in the 2016 election.[18] He had a political practices complaint filed alleging he started campaigning before registering.[19][20] The complaint was dismissed.[21]
In a campaign speech that year, Gianforte stated that he had been involved in discussions with Facebook about bringing a new call center to Montana, but that Facebook had declined because of that state's business equipment tax.[22] A Facebook spokesman disputed Gianforte's claims, saying that no discussions with Gianforte took place and that the tax was not the reason the company decided not to locate a call center in Montana. Gianforte stood by his statement saying that he had spoken with a Facebook executive the previous fall.[23]
Steve Bullock, the incumbent Democratic governor, defeated Gianforte in the November general election, 50%–46%.[24]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2017[edit]
Main article: Montana's at-large congressional district special election, 2017
On March 1, 2017, Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana's at-large congressional district resigned his seat following his confirmation by the United States Senate as United States Secretary of the Interior. Governor Bullock set a special election to finish Zinke's term for May 25 that same day.[25] Gianforte had already announced his intention to seek the seat on January 25, prior to Zinke's confirmation and subsequent resignation.[26] At a March 6 convention, the Republican Party selected Gianforte as their nominee. He faced Democratic musician and former Montana Arts Council member Rob Quist, as well as Libertarian nominee Mark Wicks, in the general election.[27]
His campaign was supported by Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr., who both stumped for Gianforte in the state.[28][29][30] According to the New York Times, Gianforte has in the 2017 race for Montana's at-large congressional district "hewed particularly close to the president's narrative: He promotes his outsider status (he has never held office) and his business acumen (his software empire, RightNow Technologies, started in a basement), and takes aim at sanctuary states and “the liberal elite” whenever he can."[31]
In financial disclosure forms filed in 2017, Gianforte indicated that he owned $150,000 worth of shares in VanEck Vectors Russia ETF and $92,400 in the IShares MSCF Russia ETF, totalling just under $250,000 in two exchange-traded funds focused on investments in Russia.[32] The investments attracted attention because they included shares in Gazprom and Rosneft, which are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed after the Russian invasion of Crimea; however, because the per-person ownership stake in these companies is so small in such index funds, they are exempt from sanctions.[32] After the issue was raised in Gianforte's 2017 congressional campaign, Gianforte stated that his Russia holdings were a small portion of his overall investments and pledged to place all of his assets in a blind trust if elected.[32][33]
Assault charge[edit]
On May 24, 2017, the day before the U.S. House special election, Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for The Guardian newspaper who was covering the election, said that Gianforte assaulted him.[34][35][36][37] Jacobs said that Gianforte "bodyslammed" him to the floor and broke the reporter's glasses.[34][35][36] The Gianforte campaign was initially unapologetic, blaming the reporter,[38] disputing the allegations, saying that Jacobs grabbed Gianforte's wrist, causing them both to fall to the ground.[39] However, an audio recording of the incident appeared to support Jacobs's statement,[40][34] and other reporters who were present at the scene corroborated Jacobs' version of events.[41]
According to Fox News reporter Alicia Acuna, who witnessed the incident, "Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground," then "began punching the man" and "yelling something to the effect of 'I'm sick and tired of this!'"; Acuna added that Jacobs was not showing "physical aggression" prior to the altercation.[42] Following the incident, Jacobs went to the hospital for x-rays.[40]
Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault by the Gallatin County Sheriff and was ordered to appear in court regarding his actions.[43][44]
Three of Montana's largest newspapers, including the Billings Gazette, the largest in the state, the Missoulian and the Independent Record, all rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte in the wake of the incident.[45][46][47][48] Speaker Paul Ryan and other members of Congress urged Gianforte to apologize.[49]
Gianforte won the special election on May 25. During his acceptance speech that evening, he apologized to Jacobs and the Fox News crew for his assault.[50] On June 7 Gianforte made a written apology to Jacobs and donated US$50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In return, Jacobs agreed to not pursue a civil claim against Gianforte.[51]
On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty and was originally sentenced to four days in jail, to be completed in part through a work program. But he was ineligible for the work program due to the assault conviction. The judge then switched the sentence to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with an $85 court fee.[4][5]
Tenure[edit]
Gianforte was sworn into the U.S. House on June 21, 2017.[52] At his inauguration ceremony, Gianforte announced his support for congressional term limits, barring members of Congress from becoming lobbysts, and holding back congressional pay if no budget is passed – it is unusual for members of Congress to announce such support for legislation in their inauguration.[53] Montana Democrats mailed Gianforte an orange prison jumpsuit at the day of his inauguration.[54][55]
Committee assignments[edit]

Committee on Natural Resources
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Gianforte opposes abortion.[56][57] He believes that abortion should be prohibited except when the woman's life is in danger.[58] Gianforte favors removing federal funds from Planned Parenthood.[58]
The Gianforte Family Foundation was founded to pursue Gianforte's creationist beliefs in the public sphere and to "protect the unborn." The foundation has been a part of anti-abortion campaigns.[59]
Aging and retirement[edit]
Gianforte has outlined his position on retirement by using the Biblical example of Noah. He said:

"There's nothing in the Bible that talks about retirement. And yet it's been an accepted concept in our culture today. Nowhere does it say, 'Well, he was a good and faithful servant, so he went to the beach... The example I think of is Noah. How old was Noah when he built the ark? 600. He wasn't like, cashing Social Security checks, he wasn't hanging out, he was working. So, I think we have an obligation to work. The role we have in work may change over time, but the concept of retirement is not biblical."[60][61][62][63]

Creationism[edit]
Gianforte has expressed support for recent creationism.[64] The Gianforte Family Foundation donated a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton replica to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum in Glendive, Montana.[65]
Donald Trump[edit]
Gianforte distanced himself from Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primary and did not attend his one rally in Montana, citing a scheduling conflict.[66][67] However, he endorsed Trump in the 2016 general election and continued to express support for him during his House campaign.[68][69][70] Gianforte has supported Trump's 2017 hiring freeze,[71] his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey,[72] and Executive Order 13769, which temporarily banned immigration from seven Middle Eastern and predominantly Muslim countries.[73]
Environment and public lands[edit]
Gianforte opposes the sale or transfer of federal land. He has called for changes to the Endangered Species Act.[71] Gianforte has also called for changes to the federal Equal Access to Justice Act to reduce environmental litigation, asserting that the act has been abused by "environmental extremists."[71]
In an April 2017 interview, Gianforte acknowledged human-caused climate change but "did not have specific ideas on how to address climate change."[71] In another April 2017 interview, however, he said that "the climate is always changing," and stated that closing coal-fired power plants would not help mitigate climate change.[74] He supported Trump's repeal of the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration.[75]
Management of public lands was a point of contention in both Gianforte's 2016 campaign for governor[76] and Gianforte's campaign for Congress.[77] In 2009, Gianforte's LLC filed a lawsuit against the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks about the boundaries of an easement for public access to the East Gallatin River.[78] Gianforte's suit against the state became an issue in the 2016 campaign with Gianforte's critics characterizing it as a wealthy out-of-stater's effort to block public access to a popular stream.[76][78][71] Gianforte "has consistently denied the allegations and called the issue a misunderstanding, noting the suit was never served." In any case, the matter was settled.[76] In his 2017 campaign for Congress, Gianforte's campaign spokesperson stated that Gianforte believes that "public lands need to stay in public hands and he opposes efforts to transfer federal lands to the states."[77]
He has called for investments in clean coal technology.[74]
Healthcare[edit]
Gianforte supports repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[79] He has declined to say whether he supports the American Health Care Act, the House Republican legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[80] That same day, Gianforte held a private conference call with Republican-leaning lobbyists in Washington D.C. where he offered a more supportive view of the American Health Care Act.[80][81] He said that it "sounds like we just passed a health care thing, which I'm thankful for, sounds like we're starting to repeal and replace."[80] Later that May, he said he would not "vote for a repeal and a replace unless I know it protects people with pre-existing conditions, lowers rates and preserves rural access".[82]
The incident where Gianforte assaulted a reporter was in response to questions about how the AHCA would make health insurance too expensive for people with pre-existing conditions.[83]
Immigration[edit]
Gianforte opposes sanctuary cities[31] and resettlement of refugees in Montana.[84]
LGBT rights[edit]
Gianforte opposes same-sex marriage,[56] and has stated that he supports government enforcement of nondiscrimination for workers, but not for customers.[85][86] Gianforte has donated to the Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family, which advocates for a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage; and the Montana Family Foundation, which is "the state's primary advocate against LGBT policies".[86]
Marijuana[edit]
Gianforte opposes the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, comparing marijuana to more addictive drugs.[87] He supports allowing the use of medical marijuana to "people in chronic pain, under the care of a doctor."[58]
Minimum wage[edit]
Gianforte opposes increases in the minimum wage, asserting "Legislating higher wages actually reduces employment opportunities for people."[88]
Russia[edit]
Gianforte has blamed the Obama administration for "the situation with Russia" and has stated that: "The US and our allies need to work together on a long-term strategy to stand against Russian aggression in the region and to ensure the sovereignty of our allies is protected."[32]
Gianforte Family Foundation[edit]
In 2004, Gianforte and his wife founded the Gianforte Family Foundation, which has made tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions[89][90] and describes as its primary mission to "support the work of faith-based organizations engaged in outreach work, strengthening families, and helping the needy; organizations in Montana that work to improve education, support entrepreneurship, and create jobs; and organizations that enhance the local community of Bozeman, Montana."[91] He, his wife, and his son are the foundation's three board members.[91] The foundation had assets of $113 million in 2013.[90]
The Gianforte Family Foundation has given nearly $900,000 to the Montana Family Foundation, in some years making up half of the total donations to the Montana Family Foundation. The Montana Family Foundation has promoted conservative and Christian values in the Montana legislature. Asked why he donated to the group, Gianforte said it was because the organization aligns with his views.[92]
Honors[edit]
Gianforte received an honorary doctorate from Stevens Institute of Technology and gave the commencement speech in 2012.[93] In 2007, Gianforte was awarded an honorary doctorate from Montana State University's College of Engineering.[94][7] In 2007, Gianforte was inducted into the CRM Hall of Fame.[95] Gianforte received the 2003 Stevens Institute of Technology's Stevens Honor Award.[96] Gianforte was named Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young in 2003.[97]
Personal life[edit]
Greg and Susan Gianforte married in 1989.[98] They live in Bozeman, Montana and have four children.[99] They attend Grace Bible Church, a nondenominational church in Bozeman. Gianforte is a donor to several Christian and conservative groups.[100][101]
Gianforte believes in Young Earth creationism.[102] belief that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. He has donated at least $290K in cash to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum, a Montana creationist museum which teaches visitors that evolution is false, the Earth is about 6,000-6,400 years old, that dinosaurs were on the Ark and that they likely died out 4,300 years ago during the flood described in the Book of Genesis.[103][104][105]

Early life and education[edit]
Gregory Richard Gianforte[7][8] was born to Frank and Dale Gianforte in San Diego, California on April 17, 1961. He is of English, Italian, and Scottish descent.[9][10][11] When he was at a young age, the family moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia, and he graduated from Upper Merion Area High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in 1979.[12] He obtained a B.E. in electrical engineering and an MSc in computer science from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1983.[13]
Career in software[edit]

Gianforte co-founded Brightwork Development Inc., a software company, in 1986; he and his partners sold the company to McAfee Associates for $10 million in 1994.[14] He then moved to Bozeman, Montana.[12]
Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies in 1997. The company went public in 2004 and was sold to Oracle Corporation for $1.5 billion in 2011.[15] Before the sale, RightNow Technologies employed about 500 people at its headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, and over 1000 people in total.[16]
Gianforte is a board member of FICO.[17]
2016 Montana gubernatorial election[edit]
Main article: Montana gubernatorial election, 2016

On January 20, 2016, Gianforte announced his candidacy for the Republican Party's nomination for governor of Montana in the 2016 election.[18] He had a political practices complaint filed alleging he started campaigning before registering.[19][20] The complaint was dismissed.[21]
In a campaign speech that year, Gianforte stated that he had been involved in discussions with Facebook about bringing a new call center to Montana, but that Facebook had declined because of that state's business equipment tax.[22] A Facebook spokesman disputed Gianforte's claims, saying that no discussions with Gianforte took place and that the tax was not the reason the company decided not to locate a call center in Montana. Gianforte stood by his statement saying that he had spoken with a Facebook executive the previous fall.[23]
Steve Bullock, the incumbent Democratic governor, defeated Gianforte in the November general election, 50%–46%.[24]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2017[edit]
Main article: Montana's at-large congressional district special election, 2017
On March 1, 2017, Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana's at-large congressional district resigned his seat following his confirmation by the United States Senate as United States Secretary of the Interior. Governor Bullock set a special election to finish Zinke's term for May 25 that same day.[25] Gianforte had already announced his intention to seek the seat on January 25, prior to Zinke's confirmation and subsequent resignation.[26] At a March 6 convention, the Republican Party selected Gianforte as their nominee. He faced Democratic musician and former Montana Arts Council member Rob Quist, as well as Libertarian nominee Mark Wicks, in the general election.[27]
His campaign was supported by Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr., who both stumped for Gianforte in the state.[28][29][30] According to the New York Times, Gianforte has in the 2017 race for Montana's at-large congressional district "hewed particularly close to the president's narrative: He promotes his outsider status (he has never held office) and his business acumen (his software empire, RightNow Technologies, started in a basement), and takes aim at sanctuary states and “the liberal elite” whenever he can."[31]
In financial disclosure forms filed in 2017, Gianforte indicated that he owned $150,000 worth of shares in VanEck Vectors Russia ETF and $92,400 in the IShares MSCF Russia ETF, totalling just under $250,000 in two exchange-traded funds focused on investments in Russia.[32] The investments attracted attention because they included shares in Gazprom and Rosneft, which are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed after the Russian invasion of Crimea; however, because the per-person ownership stake in these companies is so small in such index funds, they are exempt from sanctions.[32] After the issue was raised in Gianforte's 2017 congressional campaign, Gianforte stated that his Russia holdings were a small portion of his overall investments and pledged to place all of his assets in a blind trust if elected.[32][33]
Assault charge[edit]
On May 24, 2017, the day before the U.S. House special election, Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for The Guardian newspaper who was covering the election, said that Gianforte assaulted him.[34][35][36][37] Jacobs said that Gianforte "bodyslammed" him to the floor and broke the reporter's glasses.[34][35][36] The Gianforte campaign was initially unapologetic, blaming the reporter,[38] disputing the allegations, saying that Jacobs grabbed Gianforte's wrist, causing them both to fall to the ground.[39] However, an audio recording of the incident appeared to support Jacobs's statement,[40][34] and other reporters who were present at the scene corroborated Jacobs' version of events.[41]
According to Fox News reporter Alicia Acuna, who witnessed the incident, "Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground," then "began punching the man" and "yelling something to the effect of 'I'm sick and tired of this!'"; Acuna added that Jacobs was not showing "physical aggression" prior to the altercation.[42] Following the incident, Jacobs went to the hospital for x-rays.[40]
Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault by the Gallatin County Sheriff and was ordered to appear in court regarding his actions.[43][44]
Three of Montana's largest newspapers, including the Billings Gazette, the largest in the state, the Missoulian and the Independent Record, all rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte in the wake of the incident.[45][46][47][48] Speaker Paul Ryan and other members of Congress urged Gianforte to apologize.[49]
Gianforte won the special election on May 25. During his acceptance speech that evening, he apologized to Jacobs and the Fox News crew for his assault.[50] On June 7 Gianforte made a written apology to Jacobs and donated US$50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In return, Jacobs agreed to not pursue a civil claim against Gianforte.[51]
On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty and was originally sentenced to four days in jail, to be completed in part through a work program. But he was ineligible for the work program due to the assault conviction. The judge then switched the sentence to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with an $85 court fee.[4][5]
Tenure[edit]
Gianforte was sworn into the U.S. House on June 21, 2017.[52] At his inauguration ceremony, Gianforte announced his support for congressional term limits, barring members of Congress from becoming lobbysts, and holding back congressional pay if no budget is passed – it is unusual for members of Congress to announce such support for legislation in their inauguration.[53] Montana Democrats mailed Gianforte an orange prison jumpsuit at the day of his inauguration.[54][55]
Committee assignments[edit]

Committee on Natural Resources
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Gianforte opposes abortion.[56][57] He believes that abortion should be prohibited except when the woman's life is in danger.[58] Gianforte favors removing federal funds from Planned Parenthood.[58]
The Gianforte Family Foundation was founded to pursue Gianforte's creationist beliefs in the public sphere and to "protect the unborn." The foundation has been a part of anti-abortion campaigns.[59]
Aging and retirement[edit]
Gianforte has outlined his position on retirement by using the Biblical example of Noah. He said:

"There's nothing in the Bible that talks about retirement. And yet it's been an accepted concept in our culture today. Nowhere does it say, 'Well, he was a good and faithful servant, so he went to the beach... The example I think of is Noah. How old was Noah when he built the ark? 600. He wasn't like, cashing Social Security checks, he wasn't hanging out, he was working. So, I think we have an obligation to work. The role we have in work may change over time, but the concept of retirement is not biblical."[60][61][62][63]

Creationism[edit]
Gianforte has expressed support for recent creationism.[64] The Gianforte Family Foundation donated a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton replica to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum in Glendive, Montana.[65]
Donald Trump[edit]
Gianforte distanced himself from Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primary and did not attend his one rally in Montana, citing a scheduling conflict.[66][67] However, he endorsed Trump in the 2016 general election and continued to express support for him during his House campaign.[68][69][70] Gianforte has supported Trump's 2017 hiring freeze,[71] his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey,[72] and Executive Order 13769, which temporarily banned immigration from seven Middle Eastern and predominantly Muslim countries.[73]
Environment and public lands[edit]
Gianforte opposes the sale or transfer of federal land. He has called for changes to the Endangered Species Act.[71] Gianforte has also called for changes to the federal Equal Access to Justice Act to reduce environmental litigation, asserting that the act has been abused by "environmental extremists."[71]
In an April 2017 interview, Gianforte acknowledged human-caused climate change but "did not have specific ideas on how to address climate change."[71] In another April 2017 interview, however, he said that "the climate is always changing," and stated that closing coal-fired power plants would not help mitigate climate change.[74] He supported Trump's repeal of the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration.[75]
Management of public lands was a point of contention in both Gianforte's 2016 campaign for governor[76] and Gianforte's campaign for Congress.[77] In 2009, Gianforte's LLC filed a lawsuit against the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks about the boundaries of an easement for public access to the East Gallatin River.[78] Gianforte's suit against the state became an issue in the 2016 campaign with Gianforte's critics characterizing it as a wealthy out-of-stater's effort to block public access to a popular stream.[76][78][71] Gianforte "has consistently denied the allegations and called the issue a misunderstanding, noting the suit was never served." In any case, the matter was settled.[76] In his 2017 campaign for Congress, Gianforte's campaign spokesperson stated that Gianforte believes that "public lands need to stay in public hands and he opposes efforts to transfer federal lands to the states."[77]
He has called for investments in clean coal technology.[74]
Healthcare[edit]
Gianforte supports repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[79] He has declined to say whether he supports the American Health Care Act, the House Republican legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[80] That same day, Gianforte held a private conference call with Republican-leaning lobbyists in Washington D.C. where he offered a more supportive view of the American Health Care Act.[80][81] He said that it "sounds like we just passed a health care thing, which I'm thankful for, sounds like we're starting to repeal and replace."[80] Later that May, he said he would not "vote for a repeal and a replace unless I know it protects people with pre-existing conditions, lowers rates and preserves rural access".[82]
The incident where Gianforte assaulted a reporter was in response to questions about how the AHCA would make health insurance too expensive for people with pre-existing conditions.[83]
Immigration[edit]
Gianforte opposes sanctuary cities[31] and resettlement of refugees in Montana.[84]
LGBT rights[edit]
Gianforte opposes same-sex marriage,[56] and has stated that he supports government enforcement of nondiscrimination for workers, but not for customers.[85][86] Gianforte has donated to the Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family, which advocates for a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage; and the Montana Family Foundation, which is "the state's primary advocate against LGBT policies".[86]
Marijuana[edit]
Gianforte opposes the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, comparing marijuana to more addictive drugs.[87] He supports allowing the use of medical marijuana to "people in chronic pain, under the care of a doctor."[58]
Minimum wage[edit]
Gianforte opposes increases in the minimum wage, asserting "Legislating higher wages actually reduces employment opportunities for people."[88]
Russia[edit]
Gianforte has blamed the Obama administration for "the situation with Russia" and has stated that: "The US and our allies need to work together on a long-term strategy to stand against Russian aggression in the region and to ensure the sovereignty of our allies is protected."[32]
Gianforte Family Foundation[edit]
In 2004, Gianforte and his wife founded the Gianforte Family Foundation, which has made tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions[89][90] and describes as its primary mission to "support the work of faith-based organizations engaged in outreach work, strengthening families, and helping the needy; organizations in Montana that work to improve education, support entrepreneurship, and create jobs; and organizations that enhance the local community of Bozeman, Montana."[91] He, his wife, and his son are the foundation's three board members.[91] The foundation had assets of $113 million in 2013.[90]
The Gianforte Family Foundation has given nearly $900,000 to the Montana Family Foundation, in some years making up half of the total donations to the Montana Family Foundation. The Montana Family Foundation has promoted conservative and Christian values in the Montana legislature. Asked why he donated to the group, Gianforte said it was because the organization aligns with his views.[92]
Honors[edit]
Gianforte received an honorary doctorate from Stevens Institute of Technology and gave the commencement speech in 2012.[93] In 2007, Gianforte was awarded an honorary doctorate from Montana State University's College of Engineering.[94][7] In 2007, Gianforte was inducted into the CRM Hall of Fame.[95] Gianforte received the 2003 Stevens Institute of Technology's Stevens Honor Award.[96] Gianforte was named Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young in 2003.[97]
Personal life[edit]
Greg and Susan Gianforte married in 1989.[98] They live in Bozeman, Montana and have four children.[99] They attend Grace Bible Church, a nondenominational church in Bozeman. Gianforte is a donor to several Christian and conservative groups.[100][101]
Gianforte believes in Young Earth creationism.[102] belief that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. He has donated at least $290K in cash to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum, a Montana creationist museum which teaches visitors that evolution is false, the Earth is about 6,000-6,400 years old, that dinosaurs were on the Ark and that they likely died out 4,300 years ago during the flood described in the Book of Genesis.[103][104][105]

On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty in court on a charge of misdemeanor assault stemming from his attack on The Guardian political reporter Ben Jacobs. He was sentenced to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with a $85 court fee.[4][5] He had already paid $4464.97 in restitution as part of the criminal case.[6] Gianforte officially assumed office on June 21, 2017.

Early life and education[edit]
Gregory Richard Gianforte[7][8] was born to Frank and Dale Gianforte in San Diego, California on April 17, 1961. He is of English, Italian, and Scottish descent.[9][10][11] When he was at a young age, the family moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia, and he graduated from Upper Merion Area High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in 1979.[12] He obtained a B.E. in electrical engineering and an MSc in computer science from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1983.[13]
Career in software[edit]

Gianforte co-founded Brightwork Development Inc., a software company, in 1986; he and his partners sold the company to McAfee Associates for $10 million in 1994.[14] He then moved to Bozeman, Montana.[12]
Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies in 1997. The company went public in 2004 and was sold to Oracle Corporation for $1.5 billion in 2011.[15] Before the sale, RightNow Technologies employed about 500 people at its headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, and over 1000 people in total.[16]
Gianforte is a board member of FICO.[17]
2016 Montana gubernatorial election[edit]

On January 20, 2016, Gianforte announced his candidacy for the Republican Party's nomination for governor of Montana in the 2016 election.[18] He had a political practices complaint filed alleging he started campaigning before registering.[19][20] The complaint was dismissed.[21]
In a campaign speech that year, Gianforte stated that he had been involved in discussions with Facebook about bringing a new call center to Montana, but that Facebook had declined because of that state's business equipment tax.[22] A Facebook spokesman disputed Gianforte's claims, saying that no discussions with Gianforte took place and that the tax was not the reason the company decided not to locate a call center in Montana. Gianforte stood by his statement saying that he had spoken with a Facebook executive the previous fall.[23]
Steve Bullock, the incumbent Democratic governor, defeated Gianforte in the November general election, 50%–46%.[24]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2017[edit]
Main article: Montana's at-large congressional district special election, 2017
On March 1, 2017, Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana's at-large congressional district resigned his seat following his confirmation by the United States Senate as United States Secretary of the Interior. Governor Bullock set a special election to finish Zinke's term for May 25 that same day.[25] Gianforte had already announced his intention to seek the seat on January 25, prior to Zinke's confirmation and subsequent resignation.[26] At a March 6 convention, the Republican Party selected Gianforte as their nominee. He faced Democratic musician and former Montana Arts Council member Rob Quist, as well as Libertarian nominee Mark Wicks, in the general election.[27]
His campaign was supported by Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr., who both stumped for Gianforte in the state.[28][29][30] According to the New York Times, Gianforte has in the 2017 race for Montana's at-large congressional district "hewed particularly close to the president's narrative: He promotes his outsider status (he has never held office) and his business acumen (his software empire, RightNow Technologies, started in a basement), and takes aim at sanctuary states and “the liberal elite” whenever he can."[31]
In financial disclosure forms filed in 2017, Gianforte indicated that he owned $150,000 worth of shares in VanEck Vectors Russia ETF and $92,400 in the IShares MSCF Russia ETF, totalling just under $250,000 in two exchange-traded funds focused on investments in Russia.[32] The investments attracted attention because they included shares in Gazprom and Rosneft, which are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed after the Russian invasion of Crimea; however, because the per-person ownership stake in these companies is so small in such index funds, they are exempt from sanctions.[32] After the issue was raised in Gianforte's 2017 congressional campaign, Gianforte stated that his Russia holdings were a small portion of his overall investments and pledged to place all of his assets in a blind trust if elected.[32][33]
Assault charge[edit]
On May 24, 2017, the day before the U.S. House special election, Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for The Guardian newspaper who was covering the election, said that Gianforte assaulted him.[34][35][36][37] Jacobs said that Gianforte "bodyslammed" him to the floor and broke the reporter's glasses.[34][35][36] The Gianforte campaign was initially unapologetic, blaming the reporter,[38] disputing the allegations, saying that Jacobs grabbed Gianforte's wrist, causing them both to fall to the ground.[39] However, an audio recording of the incident appeared to support Jacobs's statement,[40][34] and other reporters who were present at the scene corroborated Jacobs' version of events.[41]
According to Fox News reporter Alicia Acuna, who witnessed the incident, "Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground," then "began punching the man" and "yelling something to the effect of 'I'm sick and tired of this!'"; Acuna added that Jacobs was not showing "physical aggression" prior to the altercation.[42] Following the incident, Jacobs went to the hospital for x-rays.[40]
Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault by the Gallatin County Sheriff and was ordered to appear in court regarding his actions.[43][44]
Three of Montana's largest newspapers, including the Billings Gazette, the largest in the state, the Missoulian and the Independent Record, all rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte in the wake of the incident.[45][46][47][48] Speaker Paul Ryan and other members of Congress urged Gianforte to apologize.[49]
Gianforte won the special election on May 25. During his acceptance speech that evening, he apologized to Jacobs and the Fox News crew for his assault.[50] On June 7 Gianforte made a written apology to Jacobs and donated US$50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In return, Jacobs agreed to not pursue a civil claim against Gianforte.[51]
On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty and was originally sentenced to four days in jail, to be completed in part through a work program. But he was ineligible for the work program due to the assault conviction. The judge then switched the sentence to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with an $85 court fee.[4][5]
Tenure[edit]
Gianforte was sworn into the U.S. House on June 21, 2017.[52] At his inauguration ceremony, Gianforte announced his support for congressional term limits, barring members of Congress from becoming lobbysts, and holding back congressional pay if no budget is passed – it is unusual for members of Congress to announce such support for legislation in their inauguration.[53] Montana Democrats mailed Gianforte an orange prison jumpsuit at the day of his inauguration.[54][55]
Committee assignments[edit]

Committee on Natural Resources
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Gianforte opposes abortion.[56][57] He believes that abortion should be prohibited except when the woman's life is in danger.[58] Gianforte favors removing federal funds from Planned Parenthood.[58]
The Gianforte Family Foundation was founded to pursue Gianforte's creationist beliefs in the public sphere and to "protect the unborn." The foundation has been a part of anti-abortion campaigns.[59]
Aging and retirement[edit]
Gianforte has outlined his position on retirement by using the Biblical example of Noah. He said:

"There's nothing in the Bible that talks about retirement. And yet it's been an accepted concept in our culture today. Nowhere does it say, 'Well, he was a good and faithful servant, so he went to the beach... The example I think of is Noah. How old was Noah when he built the ark? 600. He wasn't like, cashing Social Security checks, he wasn't hanging out, he was working. So, I think we have an obligation to work. The role we have in work may change over time, but the concept of retirement is not biblical."[60][61][62][63]

Creationism[edit]
Gianforte has expressed support for recent creationism.[64] The Gianforte Family Foundation donated a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton replica to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum in Glendive, Montana.[65]
Donald Trump[edit]
Gianforte distanced himself from Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primary and did not attend his one rally in Montana, citing a scheduling conflict.[66][67] However, he endorsed Trump in the 2016 general election and continued to express support for him during his House campaign.[68][69][70] Gianforte has supported Trump's 2017 hiring freeze,[71] his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey,[72] and Executive Order 13769, which temporarily banned immigration from seven Middle Eastern and predominantly Muslim countries.[73]
Environment and public lands[edit]
Gianforte opposes the sale or transfer of federal land. He has called for changes to the Endangered Species Act.[71] Gianforte has also called for changes to the federal Equal Access to Justice Act to reduce environmental litigation, asserting that the act has been abused by "environmental extremists."[71]
In an April 2017 interview, Gianforte acknowledged human-caused climate change but "did not have specific ideas on how to address climate change."[71] In another April 2017 interview, however, he said that "the climate is always changing," and stated that closing coal-fired power plants would not help mitigate climate change.[74] He supported Trump's repeal of the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration.[75]
Management of public lands was a point of contention in both Gianforte's 2016 campaign for governor[76] and Gianforte's campaign for Congress.[77] In 2009, Gianforte's LLC filed a lawsuit against the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks about the boundaries of an easement for public access to the East Gallatin River.[78] Gianforte's suit against the state became an issue in the 2016 campaign with Gianforte's critics characterizing it as a wealthy out-of-stater's effort to block public access to a popular stream.[76][78][71] Gianforte "has consistently denied the allegations and called the issue a misunderstanding, noting the suit was never served." In any case, the matter was settled.[76] In his 2017 campaign for Congress, Gianforte's campaign spokesperson stated that Gianforte believes that "public lands need to stay in public hands and he opposes efforts to transfer federal lands to the states."[77]
He has called for investments in clean coal technology.[74]
Healthcare[edit]
Gianforte supports repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[79] He has declined to say whether he supports the American Health Care Act, the House Republican legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[80] That same day, Gianforte held a private conference call with Republican-leaning lobbyists in Washington D.C. where he offered a more supportive view of the American Health Care Act.[80][81] He said that it "sounds like we just passed a health care thing, which I'm thankful for, sounds like we're starting to repeal and replace."[80] Later that May, he said he would not "vote for a repeal and a replace unless I know it protects people with pre-existing conditions, lowers rates and preserves rural access".[82]
The incident where Gianforte assaulted a reporter was in response to questions about how the AHCA would make health insurance too expensive for people with pre-existing conditions.[83]
Immigration[edit]
Gianforte opposes sanctuary cities[31] and resettlement of refugees in Montana.[84]
LGBT rights[edit]
Gianforte opposes same-sex marriage,[56] and has stated that he supports government enforcement of nondiscrimination for workers, but not for customers.[85][86] Gianforte has donated to the Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family, which advocates for a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage; and the Montana Family Foundation, which is "the state's primary advocate against LGBT policies".[86]
Marijuana[edit]
Gianforte opposes the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, comparing marijuana to more addictive drugs.[87] He supports allowing the use of medical marijuana to "people in chronic pain, under the care of a doctor."[58]
Minimum wage[edit]
Gianforte opposes increases in the minimum wage, asserting "Legislating higher wages actually reduces employment opportunities for people."[88]
Russia[edit]
Gianforte has blamed the Obama administration for "the situation with Russia" and has stated that: "The US and our allies need to work together on a long-term strategy to stand against Russian aggression in the region and to ensure the sovereignty of our allies is protected."[32]
Gianforte Family Foundation[edit]
In 2004, Gianforte and his wife founded the Gianforte Family Foundation, which has made tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions[89][90] and describes as its primary mission to "support the work of faith-based organizations engaged in outreach work, strengthening families, and helping the needy; organizations in Montana that work to improve education, support entrepreneurship, and create jobs; and organizations that enhance the local community of Bozeman, Montana."[91] He, his wife, and his son are the foundation's three board members.[91] The foundation had assets of $113 million in 2013.[90]
The Gianforte Family Foundation has given nearly $900,000 to the Montana Family Foundation, in some years making up half of the total donations to the Montana Family Foundation. The Montana Family Foundation has promoted conservative and Christian values in the Montana legislature. Asked why he donated to the group, Gianforte said it was because the organization aligns with his views.[92]
Honors[edit]
Gianforte received an honorary doctorate from Stevens Institute of Technology and gave the commencement speech in 2012.[93] In 2007, Gianforte was awarded an honorary doctorate from Montana State University's College of Engineering.[94][7] In 2007, Gianforte was inducted into the CRM Hall of Fame.[95] Gianforte received the 2003 Stevens Institute of Technology's Stevens Honor Award.[96] Gianforte was named Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young in 2003.[97]
Personal life[edit]
Greg and Susan Gianforte married in 1989.[98] They live in Bozeman, Montana and have four children.[99] They attend Grace Bible Church, a nondenominational church in Bozeman. Gianforte is a donor to several Christian and conservative groups.[100][101]
Gianforte believes in Young Earth creationism.[102] belief that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. He has donated at least $290K in cash to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum, a Montana creationist museum which teaches visitors that evolution is false, the Earth is about 6,000-6,400 years old, that dinosaurs were on the Ark and that they likely died out 4,300 years ago during the flood described in the Book of Genesis.[103][104][105]

Body-slamming Rep Greg Gianforte R, MT follows Trumps lead, refuses to comply with court order













     Shareblue‏Verified account @Shareblue 28m28 minutes ago Body-slamming Montana congressman follows Trump�s lead, refuses to comply with court order http://shareblue.com/body-slamming-montana-congressman-follows-trumps-lead-refuses-to-comply-with-court-order/#.WXH_GVeeuio.twitter � by @fawfulfan Link to tweet     Body-slamming Montana congressman follows Trump�s lead, refuses to comply with court orderBy Matthew Chapman   | July 21, 2017 Montana's new congressman, Greg Gianforte, is refusing to cooperate with law enforcement, despite pleading guilty to assault.Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte thinks he's above the law.(AP Photo/Bobby Caina Calvan) ........................These actions add yet more fuel to the fire for those accusing Trump of obstruction of justice, and may actually have emboldened Mueller. But most of all, they paint a picture of a man who is supremely unconcerned about the rule of law and considers it beneath him......................And Trump�s devil-may-care attitude toward the law may be having real consequences. Other Republican politicians have recently taken to flouting what is legally required of them, and few more brazenly than newly elected Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte. Recently, Gianforte made national news for violently body-slamming Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs after being asked a question about the GOP health care bill. He went on to win the election anyway the next day, but admitted wrongdoing and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault. He was fined and sentenced to community service and anger management. Despite being caught dead to rights, however, Gianforte is bizarrely refusing to come in to the county jail for his mugshot and fingerprinting. He has been defying a court order to do so for a month, and his lawyers are absurdly trying to argue it does not apply to him because he technically was not arrested.............   Past time for the County to arrest him for contempt of court.

2. and therein lies the precedent, If its ok for the POTUS then its ok for me.





This is why this ridiculous situation and example being set by the Trumps looks all the more dangerous the more the GOP endorse it, watch attorneys for years use Trump as a legal precedent.......

        Greg Gianforte lands House Natural Resources Committee spot

Greg Gianforte























































U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte will serve on the House Committee on Natural Resources, the fifth Montana congressman to do so.Gianforte, elected to the House in a May 25 special election, received his committee assignments from the House Republican Steering Committee Tuesday. In addition to House Natural Resources, Montana’s only representative will also serve on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.“We need responsible development of our natural resources. This has oversight for timber, energy mining, public land access and Indian affairs,” Gianforte said. “So, it’s a pretty broad swath of very important stuff for the state of Montana and I’m thrilled to be representing there.”
Gianforte said natural resource jobs are critical for Montana and he campaigned on increasing those opportunities. House Natural Resources also has oversight of the Endangered Species Act. Gianforte said the ESA needs to be used responsibly to protect endangered species as they recover, but not as a tool to stop natural resource development.There’s also a chance on the committee to improve access to public lands for sportsmen, Gianforte said.
Gianforte will serve on the Natural Resources Subcommittees on Federal Lands and the subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans. Chairman Rob Bishop, R-Utah, announced the appointment and welcomed Gianforte in a press release.
“I’m excited to welcome Rep. Gianforte to our team. Greg brings western values and a wealth of knowledge to the Committee and I look forward to working with him during the 115th Congress. Together we will tackle issues that are important to the way of life to Montanans and Americans all across the country.”Montana has had a representative on the House Natural Resources Committee at least since Democrat Pat Williams' tenure, which began in 1979. Because the federal government is the state's biggest landowner, the House Natural Resources committee has been a good fit.The Oversight and Government Reform Committee is the investigatory arm for both the presidential administration and Congress. Gianforte said his computer software background makes the appointment a good fit.“This group has oversight on cybersecurity, something I know something about,” Gianforte said. “We did work with over 150 federal agencies. So I’ve been through the procurement process. I understand how they buy and use computer technology. In fact some of the work they’re focused on now is on modernizing government technology.”

Congressman-elect Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., was sentenced Monday to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, and a $385 fine after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge for body slamming reporter Ben Jacobs the day before the special election last month, Politico reported.
Speaking to reporters after his appearance in court, Gianforte admitted he made a mistake and said the incident was "not a proud moment," according to a video posted on Twitter.
"When you make a mistake, you've got to take full responsibility, and that's what I've done today, and I look forward to putting this behind me."

Although Gianforte initially denied he body slammed the reporter, he won the election the next day and apologized to Jacobs during his acceptance speech, CNN reported. He also pledged to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, "in the hope that perhaps some good can come of these events."
The incident occurred May 24, when Gianforte attacked Jacobs after the journalist asked him about his stance on the House's Obamacare replacement bill, on which Gianforte had avoided taking a position.
The congressman-elect also issued a letter to Jacobs last week, saying "My physical response to your legitimate question was unprofessional, unacceptable, and unlawful. I made a mistake and humbly ask for your forgiveness."
Jacobs accepted the apology.

Who is Greg Gianforte? In Montana, the Republican's outburst against reporter came as little surprise

He’s a wealthy software entrepreneur, known for his brash persona and political ambitions.And as election day neared, Greg Gianforte seemed a  shoo-in to win a special election for Montana’s lone congressional seat.But as voters headed to the polls Thursday, questions swirled about his candidacy: Would Gianforte face backlash from those casting ballots after he was charged with assaulting a reporter? Or would voters look the other way? Might some even silently cheer the altercation captured on audiotape?A day earlier, Gianforte allegedly grabbed and slammed to the ground a reporter from the Guardian newspaper after he asked Gianforte about healthcare at the Republican’s campaign headquarters. Late Wednesday night, Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault by the Gallatin County Sheriff’s Office.For those in Montana, a bastion of conservatism where Republicans have held the state’s lone congressional seat for 23 years, Gianforte has been a familiar figure for years, primarily as a businessman. In 1997, he founded RightNow Technologies, a software company based in Bozeman. After operating it as a private enterprise, Gianforte, who employed nearly 500 people, sold it to Oracle in 2011 for nearly $1.8 billion.Gianforte, 56, had donated to political campaigns in the past, and decided to enter politics with a run for governor last year. From the get-go, his relationship with the news media was strained. At his campaign kickoff event, Gianforte refused to take any questions from reporters.Even after Gianforte won the Republican nomination for governor, his disdain for answering reporters’ questions continued. He would avoid journalists at town halls and meet-and-greets with voters.When President Trump tapped then-Rep. Ryan Zinke to lead the Department of Interior, Gianforte saw another political opportunity. He entered the special election this spring, and his relationship with the media remained tense as ever.

In April, Gianforte joked about ganging up on a reporter at town hall with hundreds of supporters. The move drew criticism from Rob Quist, Gianforte’s Democratic rival for the open seat.A day after the Republican’s clash with the Guardian reporter, three major local newspapers — the Missoulian, the Billings Gazette and the Independent Record in Helena — withdrew their endorsements of Gianforte.“We wouldn't condone it if it happened in a home or even a late-night bar fight. And we couldn't accept it from a man who is running to become Montana's lone Congressional representative,” the Billings Gazette said in an editorial.The Missoulian wrote: “There is no doubt that Gianforte committed an act of terrible judgment that, if it doesn’t land him in jail, also shouldn’t land him in the U.S. House of Representatives.”“He showed … that he lacks the experience, brains and abilities to effectively represent Montana in any elected office,” the editorial added.Montana has been something of an anomaly among red states. Although it is Republican-leaning, there is a broad populist streak going back to the robber baron days of the state's copper kings, and the right kind of Democrat — one seen as autonomous from Washington and attuned to the state's gun-loving culture — can win political office. After all, the man who defeated Gianforte in the race for governor, Steve Bullock, is a Democrat.Even so, Gianforte lost to Bullock by less than 4 percentage points, and polls have showed him as the front-runner in the special election. Would Montanans be willing to overlook the assault citation? In some quarters, the answer is yes.“This hasn’t changed my view at all,” said Kyle Nielsen, who has owned Grains of Montana Restaurant & Bakery in Billings for 13 years.He had cast an absentee ballot for Gianforte and didn’t regret it. “I’m waiting for more information.… I do think news reports can be biased against Republicans,” he said. “We need more information.”Nielsen, 43, said that while he’s not a registered Republican, he tends to vote for conservatives because he believes they understand the needs of small-business owners. Nielsen said his wife and two adult children also supported Gianforte. Last year, they all voted for Trump“We’ve seen how the media likes to battle Trump and Republicans every day, and this is nothing new,” Nielsen said.Dave Hunter, a Democratic strategist who has spent decades in Montana politics, summed up Gianforte’s chances.“Greg Gianforte is a damaged product and not very appealing to very many Montanans,” Hunter said. “But the fact that he's a Republican is probably more important than any of that to a lot of those voters.”

West originally sentenced Gianforte to a four days of jail time, to be completed in part through a work program, but switched instead to the hours of community service and anger management as those guilty of assault charges are ineligible for the work program.A misdemeanor assault conviction in Montana carries a maximum penalty of up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $500, according to the state government website.Gianforte has apologized to the journalist, Ben Jacobs, and also pledged to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization that promotes press freedom, "in the hope that perhaps some good can come of these events." Read MoreThe encounter happened on May 24, when Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault after Jacobs accused the politician of "body slamming" him at a campaign event. Gianforte, a Republican, won the election the next day and apologized to the reporter during his acceptance speech. He also issued a letter to Jacobs last week."My physical response to your legitimate question was unprofessional, unacceptable, and unlawful," Gianforte said in the letter."I made a mistake and humbly ask for your forgiveness."Jacobs accepted the apology.Jacobs was present and made a statement in the courtroom. Gianforte later asked if he could address Jacobs directly and apologized again."I just want to say I'm sorry and if and when you're ready, I look forward to sitting down with you in DC," he said.During their encounter at Gianforte's campaign headquarters in Bozeman last month, Jacobs had been asking the then-candidate about the Republican health care plan when the assault took place.Gianforte's campaign initially blamed the altercation on Jacobs' "aggressive behavior" and offered a version of events at odds with an audio recording and witness accounts. In his letter, Gianforte stated: "I had no right to respond the way did to your legitimate question about health care policy. You were doing your job."Throughout the proceedings, Rich said he was trying to give Gianforte the same sentence he would give anyone who plead guilty to attacking someone unprovoked.

He avoided jail time for the incident. (KTMF)   Congressman-elect Greg Gianforte will perform community service and anger management classes but serve no jail time for body-slamming a reporter on the eve of his election last month. Gianforte pleaded guilty to charges that he assaulted Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs at the politician’s campaign headquarters on May 24 — an incident that was witnessed by other journalists and captured on audiotape. Gallatin County Justice of the Peace Rick West sentenced Gianforte to 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management classes on Monday, reported the Associated Press. The congressman-elect, who won Montana’s lone U.S. House seat 24 hours after the assault, must also pay $385 in fines and court costs, according to the AP. He will be under court supervision until late November, when his 180-day suspended jail sentence ends. Gianforte can then petition the court to have his record cleared of the conviction if he doesn’t violate the conditions of his sentence, reported the AP.   [GOP candidate in Montana race charged with misdemeanor assault after allegedly body-slamming reporter]   Gallatin County Attorney Marty Lambert, who prosecuted the case, said the punishment handed down Monday fit Gianforte’s crime. Lambert called the sentence “just” and said that Gianforte’s “honesty and forthrightness” after the altercation will allow Montanans to “put all this behind us and move forward,” reported the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. “I don’t think Mr. Gianforte had to go to jail to reinforce the need for him not to engage in that type of behavior again,” Lambert said, according to the Daily Chronicle. “I think that sentence was fair.” Though all sides, including the judge, maintained in court Monday that Gianforte was treated no differently than any other misdemeanor offender, the congressman-elect was never required to report to the jail, take a booking photo or be fingerprinted. The judge ordered him to do so on Monday, but Gianforte’s defense attorneys said they planned to appeal, reported the AP.      A Republican candidate in Montana's special election, Greg Gianforte, allegedly 'body-slams' Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs, prompting a police investigation into the incident. (Courtesy of The Guardian)   On election eve, Jacobs tweeted that he had been “body slammed” by Gianforte after asking the candidate to respond to the Congressional Budget Office score of the American Health Care Act, as The Washington Post has reported. Gianforte deflected the question, and when Jacobs persisted the candidate told him to talk to his campaign spokesman, Shane Scanlon. Jacobs’s audio recording, later published by the Guardian, picks up the sounds of an altercation and screams from Gianforte. Jacobs can be heard saying his glasses were broken. “I’m sick and tired of you guys!” Gianforte says. “The last guy that came in here did the same thing. Get the hell out of here! Get the hell out of here! The last guy did the same thing. Are you with the Guardian?”   [Montana congressman-elect Gianforte apologizes for ‘assault’ on reporter]      Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs testifies at the court hearing for Gianforte. (Reuters/Tommy Martino)  Gianforte’s handlers initially denied Jacobs’s version of events, claiming the reporter got aggressive while asking a question and initiated the altercation. Jacobs’s audio and the Fox News team in the room at the time told a different story. Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault that night, drawing national attention that made onlookers wonder if the Republican technology entrepreneur would still be able to pull out a win in the race. During his acceptance speech a full day after the assault, Gianforte apologized to the reporter and said he “made a mistake” and “shouldn’t have treated that reporter that way.” Last week, Gianforte offered a more forceful apology and pledged to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists.  “Notwithstanding anyone’s statements to the contrary, you did not initiate any physical contact with me, and I had no right to assault you,” Gianforte wrote in a letter published June 7. “I am sorry for what I did and the unwanted notoriety this has created for you. I take full responsibility.” Jacobs attended the sentencing hearing Monday and engaged in a back and forth with Gianforte, who said he looked forward to sitting down with the reporter on Capitol Hill for a real interview once he was “ready,” reported the Daily Chronicle. “I look forward to it,” Jacobs replied.   [Newseum hopes to display reporter’s glasses broken in confrontation with Montana politician]   Reading from a prepared statement in court, Jacobs said he has interviewed hundreds of politicians, including President Trump. “Mr. Gianforte’s response was to slam me to the floor and start punching me,” Jacobs said, according to the Daily Chronicle. It also thrust him into “a national spotlight I did not seek or desire,” Jacobs reportedly said. “I have accepted his apology and fully expect his thoughtful words to be followed by concrete actions once he has taken his seat in Congress,” Jacobs told the court, according to the Daily Chronicle. Gianforte apologized again. Outside the courtroom, Gianforte spoke with reporters. “This was not a proud moment,” he said, reported the AP, “but I’m ready to move on.” More from Morning Mix Trump-like ‘Julius Caesar’ assassinated in New York play.

Early life and education[edit]
Gregory Richard Gianforte[7][8] was born to Frank and Dale Gianforte in San Diego, California on April 17, 1961. He is of English, Italian, and Scottish descent.[9][10][11] When he was at a young age, the family moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia, and he graduated from Upper Merion Area High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in 1979.[12] He obtained a B.E. in electrical engineering and an MSc in computer science from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1983.[13]
Career in software[edit]




Gianforte speaking in 2006


Gianforte co-founded Brightwork Development Inc., a software company, in 1986; he and his partners sold the company to McAfee Associates for $10 million in 1994.[14] He then moved to Bozeman, Montana.[12]
Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies in 1997. The company went public in 2004 and was sold to Oracle Corporation for $1.5 billion in 2011.[15] Before the sale, RightNow Technologies employed about 500 people at its headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, and over 1000 people in total.[16]
Gianforte is a board member of FICO.[17]
2016 Montana gubernatorial election[edit]
Main article: Montana gubernatorial election, 2016

On January 20, 2016, Gianforte announced his candidacy for the Republican Party's nomination for governor of Montana in the 2016 election.[18] He had a political practices complaint filed alleging he started campaigning before registering.[19][20] The complaint was dismissed.[21]
In a campaign speech that year, Gianforte stated that he had been involved in discussions with Facebook about bringing a new call center to Montana, but that Facebook had declined because of that state's business equipment tax.[22] A Facebook spokesman disputed Gianforte's claims, saying that no discussions with Gianforte took place and that the tax was not the reason the company decided not to locate a call center in Montana. Gianforte stood by his statement saying that he had spoken with a Facebook executive the previous fall.[23]
Steve Bullock, the incumbent Democratic governor, defeated Gianforte in the November general election, 50%–46%.[24]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2017[edit]
Main article: Montana's at-large congressional district special election, 2017
On March 1, 2017, Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana's at-large congressional district resigned his seat following his confirmation by the United States Senate as United States Secretary of the Interior. Governor Bullock set a special election to finish Zinke's term for May 25 that same day.[25] Gianforte had already announced his intention to seek the seat on January 25, prior to Zinke's confirmation and subsequent resignation.[26] At a March 6 convention, the Republican Party selected Gianforte as their nominee. He faced Democratic musician and former Montana Arts Council member Rob Quist, as well as Libertarian nominee Mark Wicks, in the general election.[27]
His campaign was supported by Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr., who both stumped for Gianforte in the state.[28][29][30] According to the New York Times, Gianforte has in the 2017 race for Montana's at-large congressional district "hewed particularly close to the president's narrative: He promotes his outsider status (he has never held office) and his business acumen (his software empire, RightNow Technologies, started in a basement), and takes aim at sanctuary states and “the liberal elite” whenever he can."[31]
In financial disclosure forms filed in 2017, Gianforte indicated that he owned $150,000 worth of shares in VanEck Vectors Russia ETF and $92,400 in the IShares MSCF Russia ETF, totalling just under $250,000 in two exchange-traded funds focused on investments in Russia.[32] The investments attracted attention because they included shares in Gazprom and Rosneft, which are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed after the Russian invasion of Crimea; however, because the per-person ownership stake in these companies is so small in such index funds, they are exempt from sanctions.[32] After the issue was raised in Gianforte's 2017 congressional campaign, Gianforte stated that his Russia holdings were a small portion of his overall investments and pledged to place all of his assets in a blind trust if elected.[32][33]
Assault charge[edit]
On May 24, 2017, the day before the U.S. House special election, Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for The Guardian newspaper who was covering the election, said that Gianforte assaulted him.[34][35][36][37] Jacobs said that Gianforte "bodyslammed" him to the floor and broke the reporter's glasses.[34][35][36] The Gianforte campaign was initially unapologetic, blaming the reporter,[38] disputing the allegations, saying that Jacobs grabbed Gianforte's wrist, causing them both to fall to the ground.[39] However, an audio recording of the incident appeared to support Jacobs's statement,[40][34] and other reporters who were present at the scene corroborated Jacobs' version of events.[41]
According to Fox News reporter Alicia Acuna, who witnessed the incident, "Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground," then "began punching the man" and "yelling something to the effect of 'I'm sick and tired of this!'"; Acuna added that Jacobs was not showing "physical aggression" prior to the altercation.[42] Following the incident, Jacobs went to the hospital for x-rays.[40]
Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault by the Gallatin County Sheriff and was ordered to appear in court regarding his actions.[43][44]
Three of Montana's largest newspapers, including the Billings Gazette, the largest in the state, the Missoulian and the Independent Record, all rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte in the wake of the incident.[45][46][47][48] Speaker Paul Ryan and other members of Congress urged Gianforte to apologize.[49]
Gianforte won the special election on May 25. During his acceptance speech that evening, he apologized to Jacobs and the Fox News crew for his assault.[50] On June 7 Gianforte made a written apology to Jacobs and donated US$50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In return, Jacobs agreed to not pursue a civil claim against Gianforte.[51]
On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty and was originally sentenced to four days in jail, to be completed in part through a work program. But he was ineligible for the work program due to the assault conviction. The judge then switched the sentence to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with an $85 court fee.[4][5]
Tenure[edit]
Gianforte was sworn into the U.S. House on June 21, 2017.[52] At his inauguration ceremony, Gianforte announced his support for congressional term limits, barring members of Congress from becoming lobbysts, and holding back congressional pay if no budget is passed – it is unusual for members of Congress to announce such support for legislation in their inauguration.[53] Montana Democrats mailed Gianforte an orange prison jumpsuit at the day of his inauguration.[54][55]
Committee assignments[edit]

Committee on Natural Resources
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Gianforte opposes abortion.[56][57] He believes that abortion should be prohibited except when the woman's life is in danger.[58] Gianforte favors removing federal funds from Planned Parenthood.[58]
The Gianforte Family Foundation was founded to pursue Gianforte's creationist beliefs in the public sphere and to "protect the unborn." The foundation has been a part of anti-abortion campaigns.[59]
Aging and retirement[edit]
Gianforte has outlined his position on retirement by using the Biblical example of Noah. He said:

"There's nothing in the Bible that talks about retirement. And yet it's been an accepted concept in our culture today. Nowhere does it say, 'Well, he was a good and faithful servant, so he went to the beach... The example I think of is Noah. How old was Noah when he built the ark? 600. He wasn't like, cashing Social Security checks, he wasn't hanging out, he was working. So, I think we have an obligation to work. The role we have in work may change over time, but the concept of retirement is not biblical."[60][61][62][63]

Creationism[edit]
Gianforte has expressed support for recent creationism.[64] The Gianforte Family Foundation donated a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton replica to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum in Glendive, Montana.[65]
Donald Trump[edit]
Gianforte distanced himself from Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primary and did not attend his one rally in Montana, citing a scheduling conflict.[66][67] However, he endorsed Trump in the 2016 general election and continued to express support for him during his House campaign.[68][69][70] Gianforte has supported Trump's 2017 hiring freeze,[71] his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey,[72] and Executive Order 13769, which temporarily banned immigration from seven Middle Eastern and predominantly Muslim countries.[73]
Environment and public lands[edit]
Gianforte opposes the sale or transfer of federal land. He has called for changes to the Endangered Species Act.[71] Gianforte has also called for changes to the federal Equal Access to Justice Act to reduce environmental litigation, asserting that the act has been abused by "environmental extremists."[71]
In an April 2017 interview, Gianforte acknowledged human-caused climate change but "did not have specific ideas on how to address climate change."[71] In another April 2017 interview, however, he said that "the climate is always changing," and stated that closing coal-fired power plants would not help mitigate climate change.[74] He supported Trump's repeal of the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration.[75]
Management of public lands was a point of contention in both Gianforte's 2016 campaign for governor[76] and Gianforte's campaign for Congress.[77] In 2009, Gianforte's LLC filed a lawsuit against the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks about the boundaries of an easement for public access to the East Gallatin River.[78] Gianforte's suit against the state became an issue in the 2016 campaign with Gianforte's critics characterizing it as a wealthy out-of-stater's effort to block public access to a popular stream.[76][78][71] Gianforte "has consistently denied the allegations and called the issue a misunderstanding, noting the suit was never served." In any case, the matter was settled.[76] In his 2017 campaign for Congress, Gianforte's campaign spokesperson stated that Gianforte believes that "public lands need to stay in public hands and he opposes efforts to transfer federal lands to the states."[77]
He has called for investments in clean coal technology.[74]
Healthcare[edit]
Gianforte supports repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[79] He has declined to say whether he supports the American Health Care Act, the House Republican legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[80] That same day, Gianforte held a private conference call with Republican-leaning lobbyists in Washington D.C. where he offered a more supportive view of the American Health Care Act.[80][81] He said that it "sounds like we just passed a health care thing, which I'm thankful for, sounds like we're starting to repeal and replace."[80] Later that May, he said he would not "vote for a repeal and a replace unless I know it protects people with pre-existing conditions, lowers rates and preserves rural access".[82]
The incident where Gianforte assaulted a reporter was in response to questions about how the AHCA would make health insurance too expensive for people with pre-existing conditions.[83]
Immigration[edit]
Gianforte opposes sanctuary cities[31] and resettlement of refugees in Montana.[84]
LGBT rights[edit]
Gianforte opposes same-sex marriage,[56] and has stated that he supports government enforcement of nondiscrimination for workers, but not for customers.[85][86] Gianforte has donated to the Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family, which advocates for a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage; and the Montana Family Foundation, which is "the state's primary advocate against LGBT policies".[86]
Marijuana[edit]
Gianforte opposes the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, comparing marijuana to more addictive drugs.[87] He supports allowing the use of medical marijuana to "people in chronic pain, under the care of a doctor."[58]
Minimum wage[edit]
Gianforte opposes increases in the minimum wage, asserting "Legislating higher wages actually reduces employment opportunities for people."[88]
Russia[edit]
Gianforte has blamed the Obama administration for "the situation with Russia" and has stated that: "The US and our allies need to work together on a long-term strategy to stand against Russian aggression in the region and to ensure the sovereignty of our allies is protected."[32]
Gianforte Family Foundation[edit]
In 2004, Gianforte and his wife founded the Gianforte Family Foundation, which has made tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions[89][90] and describes as its primary mission to "support the work of faith-based organizations engaged in outreach work, strengthening families, and helping the needy; organizations in Montana that work to improve education, support entrepreneurship, and create jobs; and organizations that enhance the local community of Bozeman, Montana."[91] He, his wife, and his son are the foundation's three board members.[91] The foundation had assets of $113 million in 2013.[90]
The Gianforte Family Foundation has given nearly $900,000 to the Montana Family Foundation, in some years making up half of the total donations to the Montana Family Foundation. The Montana Family Foundation has promoted conservative and Christian values in the Montana legislature. Asked why he donated to the group, Gianforte said it was because the organization aligns with his views.[92]
Honors[edit]
Gianforte received an honorary doctorate from Stevens Institute of Technology and gave the commencement speech in 2012.[93] In 2007, Gianforte was awarded an honorary doctorate from Montana State University's College of Engineering.[94][7] In 2007, Gianforte was inducted into the CRM Hall of Fame.[95] Gianforte received the 2003 Stevens Institute of Technology's Stevens Honor Award.[96] Gianforte was named Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young in 2003.[97]
Personal life[edit]
Greg and Susan Gianforte married in 1989.[98] They live in Bozeman, Montana and have four children.[99] They attend Grace Bible Church, a nondenominational church in Bozeman. Gianforte is a donor to several Christian and conservative groups.[100][101]
Gianforte believes in Young Earth creationism.[102] belief that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. He has donated at least $290K in cash to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum, a Montana creationist museum which teaches visitors that evolution is false, the Earth is about 6,000-6,400 years old, that dinosaurs were on the Ark and that they likely died out 4,300 years ago during the flood described in the Book of Genesis.[103][104][105]

On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty in court on a charge of misdemeanor assault stemming from his attack on The Guardian political reporter Ben Jacobs. He was sentenced to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with a $85 court fee.[4][5] He had already paid $4464.97 in restitution as part of the criminal case.[6] Gianforte officially assumed office on June 21, 2017.

Early life and education[edit]
Gregory Richard Gianforte[7][8] was born to Frank and Dale Gianforte in San Diego, California on April 17, 1961. He is of English, Italian, and Scottish descent.[9][10][11] When he was at a young age, the family moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia, and he graduated from Upper Merion Area High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in 1979.[12] He obtained a B.E. in electrical engineering and an MSc in computer science from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1983.[13]
Career in software[edit]




Gianforte speaking in 2006


Gianforte co-founded Brightwork Development Inc., a software company, in 1986; he and his partners sold the company to McAfee Associates for $10 million in 1994.[14] He then moved to Bozeman, Montana.[12]
Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies in 1997. The company went public in 2004 and was sold to Oracle Corporation for $1.5 billion in 2011.[15] Before the sale, RightNow Technologies employed about 500 people at its headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, and over 1000 people in total.[16]
Gianforte is a board member of FICO.[17]
2016 Montana gubernatorial election[edit]

On January 20, 2016, Gianforte announced his candidacy for the Republican Party's nomination for governor of Montana in the 2016 election.[18] He had a political practices complaint filed alleging he started campaigning before registering.[19][20] The complaint was dismissed.[21]
In a campaign speech that year, Gianforte stated that he had been involved in discussions with Facebook about bringing a new call center to Montana, but that Facebook had declined because of that state's business equipment tax.[22] A Facebook spokesman disputed Gianforte's claims, saying that no discussions with Gianforte took place and that the tax was not the reason the company decided not to locate a call center in Montana. Gianforte stood by his statement saying that he had spoken with a Facebook executive the previous fall.[23]
Steve Bullock, the incumbent Democratic governor, defeated Gianforte in the November general election, 50%–46%.[24]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2017[edit]
Main article: Montana's at-large congressional district special election, 2017
On March 1, 2017, Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana's at-large congressional district resigned his seat following his confirmation by the United States Senate as United States Secretary of the Interior. Governor Bullock set a special election to finish Zinke's term for May 25 that same day.[25] Gianforte had already announced his intention to seek the seat on January 25, prior to Zinke's confirmation and subsequent resignation.[26] At a March 6 convention, the Republican Party selected Gianforte as their nominee. He faced Democratic musician and former Montana Arts Council member Rob Quist, as well as Libertarian nominee Mark Wicks, in the general election.[27]
His campaign was supported by Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr., who both stumped for Gianforte in the state.[28][29][30] According to the New York Times, Gianforte has in the 2017 race for Montana's at-large congressional district "hewed particularly close to the president's narrative: He promotes his outsider status (he has never held office) and his business acumen (his software empire, RightNow Technologies, started in a basement), and takes aim at sanctuary states and “the liberal elite” whenever he can."[31]
In financial disclosure forms filed in 2017, Gianforte indicated that he owned $150,000 worth of shares in VanEck Vectors Russia ETF and $92,400 in the IShares MSCF Russia ETF, totalling just under $250,000 in two exchange-traded funds focused on investments in Russia.[32] The investments attracted attention because they included shares in Gazprom and Rosneft, which are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed after the Russian invasion of Crimea; however, because the per-person ownership stake in these companies is so small in such index funds, they are exempt from sanctions.[32] After the issue was raised in Gianforte's 2017 congressional campaign, Gianforte stated that his Russia holdings were a small portion of his overall investments and pledged to place all of his assets in a blind trust if elected.[32][33]
Assault charge[edit]
On May 24, 2017, the day before the U.S. House special election, Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for The Guardian newspaper who was covering the election, said that Gianforte assaulted him.[34][35][36][37] Jacobs said that Gianforte "bodyslammed" him to the floor and broke the reporter's glasses.[34][35][36] The Gianforte campaign was initially unapologetic, blaming the reporter,[38] disputing the allegations, saying that Jacobs grabbed Gianforte's wrist, causing them both to fall to the ground.[39] However, an audio recording of the incident appeared to support Jacobs's statement,[40][34] and other reporters who were present at the scene corroborated Jacobs' version of events.[41]
According to Fox News reporter Alicia Acuna, who witnessed the incident, "Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground," then "began punching the man" and "yelling something to the effect of 'I'm sick and tired of this!'"; Acuna added that Jacobs was not showing "physical aggression" prior to the altercation.[42] Following the incident, Jacobs went to the hospital for x-rays.[40]
Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault by the Gallatin County Sheriff and was ordered to appear in court regarding his actions.[43][44]
Three of Montana's largest newspapers, including the Billings Gazette, the largest in the state, the Missoulian and the Independent Record, all rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte in the wake of the incident.[45][46][47][48] Speaker Paul Ryan and other members of Congress urged Gianforte to apologize.[49]
Gianforte won the special election on May 25. During his acceptance speech that evening, he apologized to Jacobs and the Fox News crew for his assault.[50] On June 7 Gianforte made a written apology to Jacobs and donated US$50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In return, Jacobs agreed to not pursue a civil claim against Gianforte.[51]
On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty and was originally sentenced to four days in jail, to be completed in part through a work program. But he was ineligible for the work program due to the assault conviction. The judge then switched the sentence to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with an $85 court fee.[4][5]
Tenure[edit]
Gianforte was sworn into the U.S. House on June 21, 2017.[52] At his inauguration ceremony, Gianforte announced his support for congressional term limits, barring members of Congress from becoming lobbysts, and holding back congressional pay if no budget is passed – it is unusual for members of Congress to announce such support for legislation in their inauguration.[53] Montana Democrats mailed Gianforte an orange prison jumpsuit at the day of his inauguration.[54][55]
Committee assignments[edit]

Committee on Natural Resources
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Gianforte opposes abortion.[56][57] He believes that abortion should be prohibited except when the woman's life is in danger.[58] Gianforte favors removing federal funds from Planned Parenthood.[58]
The Gianforte Family Foundation was founded to pursue Gianforte's creationist beliefs in the public sphere and to "protect the unborn." The foundation has been a part of anti-abortion campaigns.[59]
Aging and retirement[edit]
Gianforte has outlined his position on retirement by using the Biblical example of Noah. He said:

"There's nothing in the Bible that talks about retirement. And yet it's been an accepted concept in our culture today. Nowhere does it say, 'Well, he was a good and faithful servant, so he went to the beach... The example I think of is Noah. How old was Noah when he built the ark? 600. He wasn't like, cashing Social Security checks, he wasn't hanging out, he was working. So, I think we have an obligation to work. The role we have in work may change over time, but the concept of retirement is not biblical."[60][61][62][63]

Creationism[edit]
Gianforte has expressed support for recent creationism.[64] The Gianforte Family Foundation donated a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton replica to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum in Glendive, Montana.[65]
Donald Trump[edit]
Gianforte distanced himself from Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primary and did not attend his one rally in Montana, citing a scheduling conflict.[66][67] However, he endorsed Trump in the 2016 general election and continued to express support for him during his House campaign.[68][69][70] Gianforte has supported Trump's 2017 hiring freeze,[71] his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey,[72] and Executive Order 13769, which temporarily banned immigration from seven Middle Eastern and predominantly Muslim countries.[73]
Environment and public lands[edit]
Gianforte opposes the sale or transfer of federal land. He has called for changes to the Endangered Species Act.[71] Gianforte has also called for changes to the federal Equal Access to Justice Act to reduce environmental litigation, asserting that the act has been abused by "environmental extremists."[71]
In an April 2017 interview, Gianforte acknowledged human-caused climate change but "did not have specific ideas on how to address climate change."[71] In another April 2017 interview, however, he said that "the climate is always changing," and stated that closing coal-fired power plants would not help mitigate climate change.[74] He supported Trump's repeal of the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration.[75]
Management of public lands was a point of contention in both Gianforte's 2016 campaign for governor[76] and Gianforte's campaign for Congress.[77] In 2009, Gianforte's LLC filed a lawsuit against the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks about the boundaries of an easement for public access to the East Gallatin River.[78] Gianforte's suit against the state became an issue in the 2016 campaign with Gianforte's critics characterizing it as a wealthy out-of-stater's effort to block public access to a popular stream.[76][78][71] Gianforte "has consistently denied the allegations and called the issue a misunderstanding, noting the suit was never served." In any case, the matter was settled.[76] In his 2017 campaign for Congress, Gianforte's campaign spokesperson stated that Gianforte believes that "public lands need to stay in public hands and he opposes efforts to transfer federal lands to the states."[77]
He has called for investments in clean coal technology.[74]
Healthcare[edit]
Gianforte supports repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[79] He has declined to say whether he supports the American Health Care Act, the House Republican legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[80] That same day, Gianforte held a private conference call with Republican-leaning lobbyists in Washington D.C. where he offered a more supportive view of the American Health Care Act.[80][81] He said that it "sounds like we just passed a health care thing, which I'm thankful for, sounds like we're starting to repeal and replace."[80] Later that May, he said he would not "vote for a repeal and a replace unless I know it protects people with pre-existing conditions, lowers rates and preserves rural access".[82]
The incident where Gianforte assaulted a reporter was in response to questions about how the AHCA would make health insurance too expensive for people with pre-existing conditions.[83]
Immigration[edit]
Gianforte opposes sanctuary cities[31] and resettlement of refugees in Montana.[84]
LGBT rights[edit]
Gianforte opposes same-sex marriage,[56] and has stated that he supports government enforcement of nondiscrimination for workers, but not for customers.[85][86] Gianforte has donated to the Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family, which advocates for a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage; and the Montana Family Foundation, which is "the state's primary advocate against LGBT policies".[86]
Marijuana[edit]
Gianforte opposes the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, comparing marijuana to more addictive drugs.[87] He supports allowing the use of medical marijuana to "people in chronic pain, under the care of a doctor."[58]
Minimum wage[edit]
Gianforte opposes increases in the minimum wage, asserting "Legislating higher wages actually reduces employment opportunities for people."[88]
Russia[edit]
Gianforte has blamed the Obama administration for "the situation with Russia" and has stated that: "The US and our allies need to work together on a long-term strategy to stand against Russian aggression in the region and to ensure the sovereignty of our allies is protected."[32]
Gianforte Family Foundation[edit]
In 2004, Gianforte and his wife founded the Gianforte Family Foundation, which has made tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions[89][90] and describes as its primary mission to "support the work of faith-based organizations engaged in outreach work, strengthening families, and helping the needy; organizations in Montana that work to improve education, support entrepreneurship, and create jobs; and organizations that enhance the local community of Bozeman, Montana."[91] He, his wife, and his son are the foundation's three board members.[91] The foundation had assets of $113 million in 2013.[90]
The Gianforte Family Foundation has given nearly $900,000 to the Montana Family Foundation, in some years making up half of the total donations to the Montana Family Foundation. The Montana Family Foundation has promoted conservative and Christian values in the Montana legislature. Asked why he donated to the group, Gianforte said it was because the organization aligns with his views.[92]
Honors[edit]
Gianforte received an honorary doctorate from Stevens Institute of Technology and gave the commencement speech in 2012.[93] In 2007, Gianforte was awarded an honorary doctorate from Montana State University's College of Engineering.[94][7] In 2007, Gianforte was inducted into the CRM Hall of Fame.[95] Gianforte received the 2003 Stevens Institute of Technology's Stevens Honor Award.[96] Gianforte was named Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young in 2003.[97]
Personal life[edit]
Greg and Susan Gianforte married in 1989.[98] They live in Bozeman, Montana and have four children.[99] They attend Grace Bible Church, a nondenominational church in Bozeman. Gianforte is a donor to several Christian and conservative groups.[100][101]
Gianforte believes in Young Earth creationism.[102] belief that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. He has donated at least $290K in cash to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum, a Montana creationist museum which teaches visitors that evolution is false, the Earth is about 6,000-6,400 years old, that dinosaurs were on the Ark and that they likely died out 4,300 years ago during the flood described in the Book of Genesis.[103][104][105]

Early life and education[edit]
Gregory Richard Gianforte[7][8] was born to Frank and Dale Gianforte in San Diego, California on April 17, 1961. He is of English, Italian, and Scottish descent.[9][10][11] When he was at a young age, the family moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia, and he graduated from Upper Merion Area High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in 1979.[12] He obtained a B.E. in electrical engineering and an MSc in computer science from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1983.[13]
Career in software[edit]

Gianforte co-founded Brightwork Development Inc., a software company, in 1986; he and his partners sold the company to McAfee Associates for $10 million in 1994.[14] He then moved to Bozeman, Montana.[12]
Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies in 1997. The company went public in 2004 and was sold to Oracle Corporation for $1.5 billion in 2011.[15] Before the sale, RightNow Technologies employed about 500 people at its headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, and over 1000 people in total.[16]
Gianforte is a board member of FICO.[17]
2016 Montana gubernatorial election[edit]
Main article: Montana gubernatorial election, 2016

On January 20, 2016, Gianforte announced his candidacy for the Republican Party's nomination for governor of Montana in the 2016 election.[18] He had a political practices complaint filed alleging he started campaigning before registering.[19][20] The complaint was dismissed.[21]
In a campaign speech that year, Gianforte stated that he had been involved in discussions with Facebook about bringing a new call center to Montana, but that Facebook had declined because of that state's business equipment tax.[22] A Facebook spokesman disputed Gianforte's claims, saying that no discussions with Gianforte took place and that the tax was not the reason the company decided not to locate a call center in Montana. Gianforte stood by his statement saying that he had spoken with a Facebook executive the previous fall.[23]
Steve Bullock, the incumbent Democratic governor, defeated Gianforte in the November general election, 50%–46%.[24]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2017[edit]
Main article: Montana's at-large congressional district special election, 2017
On March 1, 2017, Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana's at-large congressional district resigned his seat following his confirmation by the United States Senate as United States Secretary of the Interior. Governor Bullock set a special election to finish Zinke's term for May 25 that same day.[25] Gianforte had already announced his intention to seek the seat on January 25, prior to Zinke's confirmation and subsequent resignation.[26] At a March 6 convention, the Republican Party selected Gianforte as their nominee. He faced Democratic musician and former Montana Arts Council member Rob Quist, as well as Libertarian nominee Mark Wicks, in the general election.[27]
His campaign was supported by Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr., who both stumped for Gianforte in the state.[28][29][30] According to the New York Times, Gianforte has in the 2017 race for Montana's at-large congressional district "hewed particularly close to the president's narrative: He promotes his outsider status (he has never held office) and his business acumen (his software empire, RightNow Technologies, started in a basement), and takes aim at sanctuary states and “the liberal elite” whenever he can."[31]
In financial disclosure forms filed in 2017, Gianforte indicated that he owned $150,000 worth of shares in VanEck Vectors Russia ETF and $92,400 in the IShares MSCF Russia ETF, totalling just under $250,000 in two exchange-traded funds focused on investments in Russia.[32] The investments attracted attention because they included shares in Gazprom and Rosneft, which are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed after the Russian invasion of Crimea; however, because the per-person ownership stake in these companies is so small in such index funds, they are exempt from sanctions.[32] After the issue was raised in Gianforte's 2017 congressional campaign, Gianforte stated that his Russia holdings were a small portion of his overall investments and pledged to place all of his assets in a blind trust if elected.[32][33]
Assault charge[edit]
On May 24, 2017, the day before the U.S. House special election, Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for The Guardian newspaper who was covering the election, said that Gianforte assaulted him.[34][35][36][37] Jacobs said that Gianforte "bodyslammed" him to the floor and broke the reporter's glasses.[34][35][36] The Gianforte campaign was initially unapologetic, blaming the reporter,[38] disputing the allegations, saying that Jacobs grabbed Gianforte's wrist, causing them both to fall to the ground.[39] However, an audio recording of the incident appeared to support Jacobs's statement,[40][34] and other reporters who were present at the scene corroborated Jacobs' version of events.[41]
According to Fox News reporter Alicia Acuna, who witnessed the incident, "Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground," then "began punching the man" and "yelling something to the effect of 'I'm sick and tired of this!'"; Acuna added that Jacobs was not showing "physical aggression" prior to the altercation.[42] Following the incident, Jacobs went to the hospital for x-rays.[40]
Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault by the Gallatin County Sheriff and was ordered to appear in court regarding his actions.[43][44]
Three of Montana's largest newspapers, including the Billings Gazette, the largest in the state, the Missoulian and the Independent Record, all rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte in the wake of the incident.[45][46][47][48] Speaker Paul Ryan and other members of Congress urged Gianforte to apologize.[49]
Gianforte won the special election on May 25. During his acceptance speech that evening, he apologized to Jacobs and the Fox News crew for his assault.[50] On June 7 Gianforte made a written apology to Jacobs and donated US$50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In return, Jacobs agreed to not pursue a civil claim against Gianforte.[51]
On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty and was originally sentenced to four days in jail, to be completed in part through a work program. But he was ineligible for the work program due to the assault conviction. The judge then switched the sentence to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with an $85 court fee.[4][5]
Tenure[edit]
Gianforte was sworn into the U.S. House on June 21, 2017.[52] At his inauguration ceremony, Gianforte announced his support for congressional term limits, barring members of Congress from becoming lobbysts, and holding back congressional pay if no budget is passed – it is unusual for members of Congress to announce such support for legislation in their inauguration.[53] Montana Democrats mailed Gianforte an orange prison jumpsuit at the day of his inauguration.[54][55]
Committee assignments[edit]

Committee on Natural Resources
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Gianforte opposes abortion.[56][57] He believes that abortion should be prohibited except when the woman's life is in danger.[58] Gianforte favors removing federal funds from Planned Parenthood.[58]
The Gianforte Family Foundation was founded to pursue Gianforte's creationist beliefs in the public sphere and to "protect the unborn." The foundation has been a part of anti-abortion campaigns.[59]
Aging and retirement[edit]
Gianforte has outlined his position on retirement by using the Biblical example of Noah. He said:

"There's nothing in the Bible that talks about retirement. And yet it's been an accepted concept in our culture today. Nowhere does it say, 'Well, he was a good and faithful servant, so he went to the beach... The example I think of is Noah. How old was Noah when he built the ark? 600. He wasn't like, cashing Social Security checks, he wasn't hanging out, he was working. So, I think we have an obligation to work. The role we have in work may change over time, but the concept of retirement is not biblical."[60][61][62][63]

Creationism[edit]
Gianforte has expressed support for recent creationism.[64] The Gianforte Family Foundation donated a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton replica to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum in Glendive, Montana.[65]
Donald Trump[edit]
Gianforte distanced himself from Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primary and did not attend his one rally in Montana, citing a scheduling conflict.[66][67] However, he endorsed Trump in the 2016 general election and continued to express support for him during his House campaign.[68][69][70] Gianforte has supported Trump's 2017 hiring freeze,[71] his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey,[72] and Executive Order 13769, which temporarily banned immigration from seven Middle Eastern and predominantly Muslim countries.[73]
Environment and public lands[edit]
Gianforte opposes the sale or transfer of federal land. He has called for changes to the Endangered Species Act.[71] Gianforte has also called for changes to the federal Equal Access to Justice Act to reduce environmental litigation, asserting that the act has been abused by "environmental extremists."[71]
In an April 2017 interview, Gianforte acknowledged human-caused climate change but "did not have specific ideas on how to address climate change."[71] In another April 2017 interview, however, he said that "the climate is always changing," and stated that closing coal-fired power plants would not help mitigate climate change.[74] He supported Trump's repeal of the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration.[75]
Management of public lands was a point of contention in both Gianforte's 2016 campaign for governor[76] and Gianforte's campaign for Congress.[77] In 2009, Gianforte's LLC filed a lawsuit against the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks about the boundaries of an easement for public access to the East Gallatin River.[78] Gianforte's suit against the state became an issue in the 2016 campaign with Gianforte's critics characterizing it as a wealthy out-of-stater's effort to block public access to a popular stream.[76][78][71] Gianforte "has consistently denied the allegations and called the issue a misunderstanding, noting the suit was never served." In any case, the matter was settled.[76] In his 2017 campaign for Congress, Gianforte's campaign spokesperson stated that Gianforte believes that "public lands need to stay in public hands and he opposes efforts to transfer federal lands to the states."[77]
He has called for investments in clean coal technology.[74]
Healthcare[edit]
Gianforte supports repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[79] He has declined to say whether he supports the American Health Care Act, the House Republican legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[80] That same day, Gianforte held a private conference call with Republican-leaning lobbyists in Washington D.C. where he offered a more supportive view of the American Health Care Act.[80][81] He said that it "sounds like we just passed a health care thing, which I'm thankful for, sounds like we're starting to repeal and replace."[80] Later that May, he said he would not "vote for a repeal and a replace unless I know it protects people with pre-existing conditions, lowers rates and preserves rural access".[82]
The incident where Gianforte assaulted a reporter was in response to questions about how the AHCA would make health insurance too expensive for people with pre-existing conditions.[83]
Immigration[edit]
Gianforte opposes sanctuary cities[31] and resettlement of refugees in Montana.[84]
LGBT rights[edit]
Gianforte opposes same-sex marriage,[56] and has stated that he supports government enforcement of nondiscrimination for workers, but not for customers.[85][86] Gianforte has donated to the Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family, which advocates for a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage; and the Montana Family Foundation, which is "the state's primary advocate against LGBT policies".[86]
Marijuana[edit]
Gianforte opposes the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, comparing marijuana to more addictive drugs.[87] He supports allowing the use of medical marijuana to "people in chronic pain, under the care of a doctor."[58]
Minimum wage[edit]
Gianforte opposes increases in the minimum wage, asserting "Legislating higher wages actually reduces employment opportunities for people."[88]
Russia[edit]
Gianforte has blamed the Obama administration for "the situation with Russia" and has stated that: "The US and our allies need to work together on a long-term strategy to stand against Russian aggression in the region and to ensure the sovereignty of our allies is protected."[32]
Gianforte Family Foundation[edit]
In 2004, Gianforte and his wife founded the Gianforte Family Foundation, which has made tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions[89][90] and describes as its primary mission to "support the work of faith-based organizations engaged in outreach work, strengthening families, and helping the needy; organizations in Montana that work to improve education, support entrepreneurship, and create jobs; and organizations that enhance the local community of Bozeman, Montana."[91] He, his wife, and his son are the foundation's three board members.[91] The foundation had assets of $113 million in 2013.[90]
The Gianforte Family Foundation has given nearly $900,000 to the Montana Family Foundation, in some years making up half of the total donations to the Montana Family Foundation. The Montana Family Foundation has promoted conservative and Christian values in the Montana legislature. Asked why he donated to the group, Gianforte said it was because the organization aligns with his views.[92]
Honors[edit]
Gianforte received an honorary doctorate from Stevens Institute of Technology and gave the commencement speech in 2012.[93] In 2007, Gianforte was awarded an honorary doctorate from Montana State University's College of Engineering.[94][7] In 2007, Gianforte was inducted into the CRM Hall of Fame.[95] Gianforte received the 2003 Stevens Institute of Technology's Stevens Honor Award.[96] Gianforte was named Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young in 2003.[97]
Personal life[edit]
Greg and Susan Gianforte married in 1989.[98] They live in Bozeman, Montana and have four children.[99] They attend Grace Bible Church, a nondenominational church in Bozeman. Gianforte is a donor to several Christian and conservative groups.[100][101]
Gianforte believes in Young Earth creationism.[102] belief that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. He has donated at least $290K in cash to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum, a Montana creationist museum which teaches visitors that evolution is false, the Earth is about 6,000-6,400 years old, that dinosaurs were on the Ark and that they likely died out 4,300 years ago during the flood described in the Book of Genesis.[103][104][105]

On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty in court on a charge of misdemeanor assault stemming from his attack on The Guardian political reporter Ben Jacobs. He was sentenced to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with a $85 court fee.[4][5] He had already paid $4464.97 in restitution as part of the criminal case.[6] Gianforte officially assumed office on June 21, 2017.

Early life and education[edit]
Gregory Richard Gianforte[7][8] was born to Frank and Dale Gianforte in San Diego, California on April 17, 1961. He is of English, Italian, and Scottish descent.[9][10][11] When he was at a young age, the family moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia, and he graduated from Upper Merion Area High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in 1979.[12] He obtained a B.E. in electrical engineering and an MSc in computer science from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1983.[13]
Career in software[edit]




Gianforte speaking in 2006


Gianforte co-founded Brightwork Development Inc., a software company, in 1986; he and his partners sold the company to McAfee Associates for $10 million in 1994.[14] He then moved to Bozeman, Montana.[12]
Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies in 1997. The company went public in 2004 and was sold to Oracle Corporation for $1.5 billion in 2011.[15] Before the sale, RightNow Technologies employed about 500 people at its headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, and over 1000 people in total.[16]
Gianforte is a board member of FICO.[17]
2016 Montana gubernatorial election[edit]

On January 20, 2016, Gianforte announced his candidacy for the Republican Party's nomination for governor of Montana in the 2016 election.[18] He had a political practices complaint filed alleging he started campaigning before registering.[19][20] The complaint was dismissed.[21]
In a campaign speech that year, Gianforte stated that he had been involved in discussions with Facebook about bringing a new call center to Montana, but that Facebook had declined because of that state's business equipment tax.[22] A Facebook spokesman disputed Gianforte's claims, saying that no discussions with Gianforte took place and that the tax was not the reason the company decided not to locate a call center in Montana. Gianforte stood by his statement saying that he had spoken with a Facebook executive the previous fall.[23]
Steve Bullock, the incumbent Democratic governor, defeated Gianforte in the November general election, 50%–46%.[24]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2017[edit]
Main article: Montana's at-large congressional district special election, 2017
On March 1, 2017, Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana's at-large congressional district resigned his seat following his confirmation by the United States Senate as United States Secretary of the Interior. Governor Bullock set a special election to finish Zinke's term for May 25 that same day.[25] Gianforte had already announced his intention to seek the seat on January 25, prior to Zinke's confirmation and subsequent resignation.[26] At a March 6 convention, the Republican Party selected Gianforte as their nominee. He faced Democratic musician and former Montana Arts Council member Rob Quist, as well as Libertarian nominee Mark Wicks, in the general election.[27]
His campaign was supported by Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr., who both stumped for Gianforte in the state.[28][29][30] According to the New York Times, Gianforte has in the 2017 race for Montana's at-large congressional district "hewed particularly close to the president's narrative: He promotes his outsider status (he has never held office) and his business acumen (his software empire, RightNow Technologies, started in a basement), and takes aim at sanctuary states and “the liberal elite” whenever he can."[31]
In financial disclosure forms filed in 2017, Gianforte indicated that he owned $150,000 worth of shares in VanEck Vectors Russia ETF and $92,400 in the IShares MSCF Russia ETF, totalling just under $250,000 in two exchange-traded funds focused on investments in Russia.[32] The investments attracted attention because they included shares in Gazprom and Rosneft, which are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed after the Russian invasion of Crimea; however, because the per-person ownership stake in these companies is so small in such index funds, they are exempt from sanctions.[32] After the issue was raised in Gianforte's 2017 congressional campaign, Gianforte stated that his Russia holdings were a small portion of his overall investments and pledged to place all of his assets in a blind trust if elected.[32][33]
Assault charge[edit]
On May 24, 2017, the day before the U.S. House special election, Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for The Guardian newspaper who was covering the election, said that Gianforte assaulted him.[34][35][36][37] Jacobs said that Gianforte "bodyslammed" him to the floor and broke the reporter's glasses.[34][35][36] The Gianforte campaign was initially unapologetic, blaming the reporter,[38] disputing the allegations, saying that Jacobs grabbed Gianforte's wrist, causing them both to fall to the ground.[39] However, an audio recording of the incident appeared to support Jacobs's statement,[40][34] and other reporters who were present at the scene corroborated Jacobs' version of events.[41]
According to Fox News reporter Alicia Acuna, who witnessed the incident, "Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground," then "began punching the man" and "yelling something to the effect of 'I'm sick and tired of this!'"; Acuna added that Jacobs was not showing "physical aggression" prior to the altercation.[42] Following the incident, Jacobs went to the hospital for x-rays.[40]
Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault by the Gallatin County Sheriff and was ordered to appear in court regarding his actions.[43][44]
Three of Montana's largest newspapers, including the Billings Gazette, the largest in the state, the Missoulian and the Independent Record, all rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte in the wake of the incident.[45][46][47][48] Speaker Paul Ryan and other members of Congress urged Gianforte to apologize.[49]
Gianforte won the special election on May 25. During his acceptance speech that evening, he apologized to Jacobs and the Fox News crew for his assault.[50] On June 7 Gianforte made a written apology to Jacobs and donated US$50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In return, Jacobs agreed to not pursue a civil claim against Gianforte.[51]
On June 12, 2017, Gianforte pleaded guilty and was originally sentenced to four days in jail, to be completed in part through a work program. But he was ineligible for the work program due to the assault conviction. The judge then switched the sentence to 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, 180-day deferred sentence, and a $300 fine along with an $85 court fee.[4][5]
Tenure[edit]
Gianforte was sworn into the U.S. House on June 21, 2017.[52] At his inauguration ceremony, Gianforte announced his support for congressional term limits, barring members of Congress from becoming lobbysts, and holding back congressional pay if no budget is passed – it is unusual for members of Congress to announce such support for legislation in their inauguration.[53] Montana Democrats mailed Gianforte an orange prison jumpsuit at the day of his inauguration.[54][55]
Committee assignments[edit]

Committee on Natural Resources
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

Political positions[edit]
Abortion[edit]
Gianforte opposes abortion.[56][57] He believes that abortion should be prohibited except when the woman's life is in danger.[58] Gianforte favors removing federal funds from Planned Parenthood.[58]
The Gianforte Family Foundation was founded to pursue Gianforte's creationist beliefs in the public sphere and to "protect the unborn." The foundation has been a part of anti-abortion campaigns.[59]
Aging and retirement[edit]
Gianforte has outlined his position on retirement by using the Biblical example of Noah. He said:

"There's nothing in the Bible that talks about retirement. And yet it's been an accepted concept in our culture today. Nowhere does it say, 'Well, he was a good and faithful servant, so he went to the beach... The example I think of is Noah. How old was Noah when he built the ark? 600. He wasn't like, cashing Social Security checks, he wasn't hanging out, he was working. So, I think we have an obligation to work. The role we have in work may change over time, but the concept of retirement is not biblical."[60][61][62][63]

Creationism[edit]
Gianforte has expressed support for recent creationism.[64] The Gianforte Family Foundation donated a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton replica to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum in Glendive, Montana.[65]
Donald Trump[edit]
Gianforte distanced himself from Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primary and did not attend his one rally in Montana, citing a scheduling conflict.[66][67] However, he endorsed Trump in the 2016 general election and continued to express support for him during his House campaign.[68][69][70] Gianforte has supported Trump's 2017 hiring freeze,[71] his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey,[72] and Executive Order 13769, which temporarily banned immigration from seven Middle Eastern and predominantly Muslim countries.[73]
Environment and public lands[edit]
Gianforte opposes the sale or transfer of federal land. He has called for changes to the Endangered Species Act.[71] Gianforte has also called for changes to the federal Equal Access to Justice Act to reduce environmental litigation, asserting that the act has been abused by "environmental extremists."[71]
In an April 2017 interview, Gianforte acknowledged human-caused climate change but "did not have specific ideas on how to address climate change."[71] In another April 2017 interview, however, he said that "the climate is always changing," and stated that closing coal-fired power plants would not help mitigate climate change.[74] He supported Trump's repeal of the Clean Power Plan introduced by the Obama administration.[75]
Management of public lands was a point of contention in both Gianforte's 2016 campaign for governor[76] and Gianforte's campaign for Congress.[77] In 2009, Gianforte's LLC filed a lawsuit against the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks about the boundaries of an easement for public access to the East Gallatin River.[78] Gianforte's suit against the state became an issue in the 2016 campaign with Gianforte's critics characterizing it as a wealthy out-of-stater's effort to block public access to a popular stream.[76][78][71] Gianforte "has consistently denied the allegations and called the issue a misunderstanding, noting the suit was never served." In any case, the matter was settled.[76] In his 2017 campaign for Congress, Gianforte's campaign spokesperson stated that Gianforte believes that "public lands need to stay in public hands and he opposes efforts to transfer federal lands to the states."[77]
He has called for investments in clean coal technology.[74]
Healthcare[edit]
Gianforte supports repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[79] He has declined to say whether he supports the American Health Care Act, the House Republican legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[80] That same day, Gianforte held a private conference call with Republican-leaning lobbyists in Washington D.C. where he offered a more supportive view of the American Health Care Act.[80][81] He said that it "sounds like we just passed a health care thing, which I'm thankful for, sounds like we're starting to repeal and replace."[80] Later that May, he said he would not "vote for a repeal and a replace unless I know it protects people with pre-existing conditions, lowers rates and preserves rural access".[82]
The incident where Gianforte assaulted a reporter was in response to questions about how the AHCA would make health insurance too expensive for people with pre-existing conditions.[83]
Immigration[edit]
Gianforte opposes sanctuary cities[31] and resettlement of refugees in Montana.[84]
LGBT rights[edit]
Gianforte opposes same-sex marriage,[56] and has stated that he supports government enforcement of nondiscrimination for workers, but not for customers.[85][86] Gianforte has donated to the Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family, which advocates for a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage; and the Montana Family Foundation, which is "the state's primary advocate against LGBT policies".[86]
Marijuana[edit]
Gianforte opposes the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, comparing marijuana to more addictive drugs.[87] He supports allowing the use of medical marijuana to "people in chronic pain, under the care of a doctor."[58]
Minimum wage[edit]
Gianforte opposes increases in the minimum wage, asserting "Legislating higher wages actually reduces employment opportunities for people."[88]
Russia[edit]
Gianforte has blamed the Obama administration for "the situation with Russia" and has stated that: "The US and our allies need to work together on a long-term strategy to stand against Russian aggression in the region and to ensure the sovereignty of our allies is protected."[32]
Gianforte Family Foundation[edit]
In 2004, Gianforte and his wife founded the Gianforte Family Foundation, which has made tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions[89][90] and describes as its primary mission to "support the work of faith-based organizations engaged in outreach work, strengthening families, and helping the needy; organizations in Montana that work to improve education, support entrepreneurship, and create jobs; and organizations that enhance the local community of Bozeman, Montana."[91] He, his wife, and his son are the foundation's three board members.[91] The foundation had assets of $113 million in 2013.[90]
The Gianforte Family Foundation has given nearly $900,000 to the Montana Family Foundation, in some years making up half of the total donations to the Montana Family Foundation. The Montana Family Foundation has promoted conservative and Christian values in the Montana legislature. Asked why he donated to the group, Gianforte said it was because the organization aligns with his views.[92]
Honors[edit]
Gianforte received an honorary doctorate from Stevens Institute of Technology and gave the commencement speech in 2012.[93] In 2007, Gianforte was awarded an honorary doctorate from Montana State University's College of Engineering.[94][7] In 2007, Gianforte was inducted into the CRM Hall of Fame.[95] Gianforte received the 2003 Stevens Institute of Technology's Stevens Honor Award.[96] Gianforte was named Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young in 2003.[97]
Personal life[edit]
Greg and Susan Gianforte married in 1989.[98] They live in Bozeman, Montana and have four children.[99] They attend Grace Bible Church, a nondenominational church in Bozeman. Gianforte is a donor to several Christian and conservative groups.[100][101]
Gianforte believes in Young Earth creationism.[102] belief that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. He has donated at least $290K in cash to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum, a Montana creationist museum which teaches visitors that evolution is false, the Earth is about 6,000-6,400 years old, that dinosaurs were on the Ark and that they likely died out 4,300 years ago during the flood described in the Book of Genesis.[103][104][105]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
