            STRAITS FINANCIAL PREMIER (U.S. FEEDER) FUND I, L.P. PRESS RELEASE
        

            
            Dec 18, 2014
        

            Chicago, Illinois-- Straits Financial Fund Management LLC ("SFFM"), a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA"), is pleased to announce today the launch of the Straits Financial Premier (U.S. Feeder) Fund I, L.P., which is the company's first managed pool offering for U.S. investors. 
SFFM, together with other subsidiaries under Straits Financial Group ("SF Group"), offers a wide range of services, including execution, brokerage, clearing and electronic trading, which provide clients with a gateway to trade at the world’s leading futures exchanges.  SF Group is the brokering division of CWT Limited, one of the largest publicly-listed logistics companies in South East Asia.

Company

      Commodity Futures Trading Commission fully registered and licensed Commodity Pool
      Operator, is proud to present its first offering: Straits Financial Premier (U.S. Feeder)

      objectives of U.S. Institutional and Accredited Investors. An investment allows access to
      Dunn's World Monetary and Agriculture (WMA) Program.

futures. The CTA has been trading their own and client money for 42 years. Located in Stuart, Florida
the firm has 22 full time employees and a professionally staffed 24/7 trading desk. As of August, 2016
Dunn has $655 million in Assets under Management in the WMA program.

NASDAQ 100 Index – Daily
Near Term Trend: BullishFriday’s Close: 5,921.52 (+ 0.01%)UPDATE: Last week, I suggested buying if NDX tests 5,710 with a target of 6,100 and stops below 5678.The NDX continued the recent upside move for the duration of last week – blowing off any concerns about valuations or “top-ticking” the market. Technically, the upside now projects up to 6136 – perhaps after a pullback.Buy any dips in the NDX down to 5,750 with stops on any daily close below 5,709 and with an upside target of 6,136.
