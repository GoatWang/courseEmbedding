        Define the whys, whens, and whats


        Roadmapping comes first, build what matters second
      







          Aha! is the one product management tool you need to lead product with conviction and be happy doing it. If you are like most product managers, Aha! is what you have always wanted to replace the Word, Google, Excel, Dropbox, and PPT docs that are scattered all over your hard drive and the cloud.
        











How does your product team work?
No matter what type of product team you work with, Aha! is a tool for driving product strategy, sharing your roadmap, and detailing features and user stories. We call this the why, when, and what of roadmapping. Engineering teams are responsible for how features get developed.



The Why
Goals and initiatives


The When
Schedules and timelines


The What
Releases and features


The How
Engineering development



We know that you are doing your best to explain where the product is headed, highlight the business value, and lead your product team. We also know that engineering teams can be demanding. They want to understand your vision for the product and they require detailed features and user stories to efficiently build what customers want. The reality is that it’s not easy with the product management tools you have.
How does your engineering team work?
While many engineering teams have a bug tracking system to manage their work, others do not. Aha! works in both environments but is fundamentally designed for you – the product manager. If your engineering team uses a bug system like JIRA, we integrate directly with it allowing you to set strategy, releases, and features in Aha! and send them to JIRA to be worked. As engineers work and update JIRA, Aha! is automatically updated and you can always easily check what's happening without having to navigate another tool.
Aha! also works well for teams that do not have a bug or other engineering planning system. Aha! provides a workflow board for agile or scrum teams, status controls by feature and requirement, and cross-functional release gantt charts so you are always informed. So, regardless of how your team works, Aha! is the product tool built for you.

Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.

Layer opened.Expense ratio







A mutual fund's annual operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net assets. It's calculated annually and removed from the fund's earnings before they're distributed to investors, directly reducing investors' returns.An expense ratio includes management, administrative, marketing, and distribution fees. It doesn't include loads or purchase or redemption fees.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Vanguard stock funds


93% of our low-cost stock mutual funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Give your money a chance to grow over the long term
Get higher potential for investment growth



Stock mutual funds aim to provide long-term growth, unlike bond funds, which focus on income. In exchange for more growth, however, you're likely to experience more ups and downs in the value of your investment.

Increase diversification in your portfolio



A stock fund could give you access to hundreds—sometimes thousands—of stocks, which spreads out risk more than owning individual stocks.

Get broad exposure to the stock markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the stock portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of stocks in a single, diversified fund.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund holds more than 3,000 domestic stocks.

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund holds more than 5,500 non-U.S. stocks.

How to choose a stock fund



Here are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right Vanguard stock fund for your portfolio:

How do stock mutual funds differ from one another?



When looking for a stock fund, consider these two characteristics:

Investing style. In general, stock funds invest in value stocks, growth stocks, or a blend of the two.

Capitalization. Stock funds also choose investments based on the size, or capitalization, of a company. Companies are considered either small-, mid-, or large-cap.


See a complete list of Vanguard stock funds


Do I want domestic or international stocks?








Investing in both U.S. and international stock funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While actively managed funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark, they can also underperform.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Should I focus on a specific industry?



You can choose a fund that invests solely in a specific sector of the market, like health care, technology, or telecommunications.But remember, these funds have a very narrow focus and expose you to more risk. Sector and specialty funds should only be used to supplement an already diversified portfolio.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

1 You have choices for what to do with your employer sponsored retirement plan. Depending on your financial circumstances, needs and goals, you may choose to roll over to an IRA or convert to a Roth, roll over to an employer sponsored plan from a prior employer to an employer sponsored plan at your new employer, take a distribution or leave the account where it is. Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care.

PERFORMANCE & CHARACTERISTICS





INVESTMENT RISKS


*Effective June 29, 2016, the Government/REPO Portfolio changed its name to Government Portfolio.
Government Portfolio: You could lose money by investing in the Portfolio. Although the Portfolio seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Portfolio is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
Money Market Portfolio: You could lose money by investing in the Portfolio. Because the share price of the Portfolio will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The Portfolio may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Portfolio’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Portfolio is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
Bonds offer a relatively stable level of income, although bond prices will fluctuate providing the potential for principal gain or loss. Intermediate-term, higher quality bonds generally offer less risk than longer term bonds and a lower rate of return. Generally, a fund’s fixed income securities will decrease in value if interest rates rise and vice versa.
The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the Fund, and may be obtained by calling (800) 621-9215, or visiting the website at www.pif.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
The Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.
Not FDIC Insured ♦ No Bank Guarantee ♦ May Lose Value

PRESIDENT'S LETTER                                                              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              February 9, 2000

Fellow Investors:                                                               

BCS Financial Services Corporation on behalf of the Board of Trustees, presents 
the 1999 Annual Report for Plan Investment Fund. During 1999 the administrative 
function for Plan Investment Fund was successfully migrated to BCS Financial    
Services. This change was made without any disruption to the Participation      
Certificate holders or the other service providers. This successful transition  
was due, in no small part, to the efforts of the prior Administrator, Health    
Plans Capital Services Corp. and BCS Financial Services Corporation. I am happy 
to report also, that Plan Investment Fund experienced no problems related to the
Y2K issue.                                                                      

The investment advisors discuss later in the Report the increase in short term  
rates and the impact on the portfolios. Rates have gone up as a result of the   
Federal Reserve's actions. This situation in conjunction with concerns about    
investor actions approaching the end of the century prompted both managers to   
shorten portfolio durations. In spite of these factors the returns on the Plan  
Investment Fund portfolios remained very competitive while maintaining very high
credit quality.                                                                 

During the past year average balances within Plan Investment Fund have been     
below the levels of the prior two years. This decline we believe is the result  
of reduced cash flows and decisions at some of the Blue organizations to        
reallocate their investments.                                                   

There are presently 44 members of the Blue System that use Plan Investment Fund 
and, we believe the wide usage of Plan Investment Fund demonstrates that these  
portfolios provide a valuable investment alternative in many different          
situations. We will continue to pursue ways to improve the value for investors  
while maintaining the high quality and service that are the hallmark of Plan    
Investment Fund.                                                                

                Sincerely,

                     Edward J. Baran

REPORT FROM THE MONEY MARKET AND GOVERNMENT/REPO PORTFOLIO ADVISOR              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A robust U.S. economy, coupled with recoveries abroad, put upward pressure on   
interest rates in the U.S. markets during the past year. The surge in growth, as
exemplified by a thirty year low in U.S. unemployment and a 5.7% gain in third  
quarter gross domestic product ("GDP"), led to increased focus on the massive   
U.S. current account deficit, a weaker dollar and rising commodity prices.      
Higher prices, particularly in the energy sector, and tight labor markets caused
concerns of profit margin compression for U.S. corporations and negative        
sentiment in the bond market.                                                   

Faced by strong economic reports, and despite reassuringly low levels of        
inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to increase short-term
interest rates three times in 1999, raising the federal funds target from 4.75% 
in May to 5.50% in November. The third tightening, in November, effectively     
reversed all of the easings instituted in the third and fourth quarters of 1998,
amid the global financial crisis.                                               

As the year draws to a close, the Federal Reserve ("Fed") will continue to      
monitor the strength of the economy and its remarkable pace of growth. With     
expected year-over-year GDP growth of 4.3% for 1999, and with the tightness of  
the labor market and pressure on wages, the Fed will have to remain vigilant to 
prevent an end to the current nine-year record expansion in the U.S.            

Although there was no change in monetary policy until mid-year, the money market
yield curve steepened, in anticipation, early in the year. The Money Market     
Portfolio extended its average weighted maturity during this time to the mid-60 
day range to take advantage of additional yield out the curve. In May, the Fed  
adopted a bias towards tightening, further steepening the yield curve. On June  
30, the Fed increased the federal funds rate 25 basis points. Coincident with   
the increase in rates during the year, the Money Market Portfolio's assets      
declined to the $300-350 million range for much of the year. At year-end,       
government agency discount notes were purchased for anticipated liquidity needs,
due to the uncertainty about Y2K-related cash flows. The average weighted       
maturity declined from the high 30's during the fourth quarter to 22 days at    
year-end, as additional cash was held as a precaution. The Portfolio's total    
return for the year was 5.02% versus 4.81% for the IBC's Total Institutions-Only
category. Assets at year-end rose to $426 million.                              

The Government/REPO Portfolio adhered to its policy of investing substantially  
all its assets in overnight investments. The Portfolio's repurchase agreements  
were collateralized by U.S. government obligations and the repo counterparties  
were analyzed for their credit quality. Like the Money Market Portfolio,        
government agencies were purchased for anticipated liquidity needs at year-end. 
For 1999, the Government/REPO Portfolio produced a total return of 5.05% while  
finishing the year with assets of $116.6 million.

Managing Director

REPORT FROM THE SHORT-TERM PORTFOLIO ADVISOR                                    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The final quarter of 1999 ended with a surprising calm. Interest rates on very  
short maturity issues fell to 2%, the Y2K bug never created the feared epidemic,
and the Federal Reserve ("Fed") tonic of keeping the markets liquid and         
confident worked well.                                                          

However throughout the quarter we saw rates rise roughly a 1/2 to 3/4 of a      
percent as the bond market completed a very tough year. True to our discipline  
we kept the weighted average maturity of the portfolio in a defensive range,    
considerably shorter than the benchmark.                                        

We focused on preserving principal and took advantage of "turn" rates in high   
quality corporate and Agency debt, as they were extremely attractive through mid
December. Careful security selection was rewarded as credit quality weakened in 
some sectors and corporate downgrades exceeded upgrades by the ratings services.
We avoided the longer maturities, as it became clear that our economy continues 
to be robust, consumer demand and confidence is strong, and there could be more 
rate increases in the new year, as the Fed remains on inflation alert.          

We have seen this pattern before. The easy monetary policy during 1993 was      
focused on the weak banking and savings and loan sectors. The follow-up in      
1994-95 was a series of seven increases doubling the Fed Funds rate from 3 to   
6%. As you will recall in 1995 the Fed also capitulated later in the year as    
funds were reduced to 5.5%, providing excellent returns to fixed income         
investors. More recently we had the 1998 successful Fed action to head off an   
international financial crisis. Three rate reductions provided financial system 
liquidity and restored stability. The reversal in 1999 probably does not        
complete the Fed's work of tightening monetary policy enough to subdue the      
threat of inflation. Therefore, the market has discounted some additional       
tightening to be accomplished sooner rather than later. Will there be an        
attractive entry point for additional investments in fixed income in 2000? We   
believe the answer is a resounding yes!

(1)     Without the waiver of a portion of advisory and administration fees (see

1995, respectively.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A.   Plan Investment Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified open-end regulated  
 investment company. The Fund consists of three separate portfolios, the
  Government/REPO Portfolio, the Money Market Portfolio and the Short-Term
Portfolio (the "Portfolio(s)"). The Fund is authorized to issue five  
 billion Participation Certificates ("PCs"), par value $.001 per PC. The
    Fund presently offers three classes of PCs as follows: the Government/REPO
  Portfolio - one billion PCs authorized, the Money Market Portfolio - two
billion PCs authorized and the Short-Term Portfolio - one billion PCs 
authorized.                                                           

B.   Significant accounting policies relating to the Fund are as follows:       

    Security Valuation - Government/REPO Portfolio and Money Market Portfolio:
   Securities are valued under the amortized cost method, which approximates
     current market value. Under this method, securities are valued at cost when
purchased and thereafter a constant proportionate amortization of any 
 discount or premium is recorded until maturity or sale of the security.

Security Valuation - Short-Term Portfolio: Securities for which market
     quotations are readily available (other than debt securities with remaining
 maturities of 60 days or less) are valued at the most recent quoted bid
price provided by investment dealers. Debt securities with remaining  
     maturities of 60 days or less are valued on an amortized cost basis (unless
    the Board determines that such basis does not represent fair value at that
time).                                                                

     Securities Transactions and Investment Income - Securities transactions are
   recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on investments sold
   are recorded on the identified cost basis. Interest income is recorded on
the accrual basis.                                                    

Dividends to Participation Certificate Holders - Dividends of net     
  investment income of the Portfolios are declared daily and paid monthly.
    Dividends payable are recorded on the dividend record date. The Portfolios
  intend, subject to the use of offsetting capital loss carry-forwards, to
  distribute net realized short- and long-term capital gains, if any, once
each year.                                                            

     Federal Income Taxes - No provision is made for federal taxes as it is each
Portfolio's intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment
company and to make the requisite distributions to Participation      
     Certificate Holders which will be sufficient to relieve each Portfolio from
     all, or substantially all, federal income and excise taxes. At December 31,
1999, the Short-Term Portfolio had capital loss carry-forwards amounting to
     $854,279, $114,232, $40,211 and $32,174 that expire in 2002, 2004, 2005 and
2007 respectively. These loss carry-forwards are available to offset  
    possible future capital gains of the Short-Term Portfolio. At December 31,
1999, the Money Market Portfolio had a capital loss carry-forward amounting
 to $3,910 that expires in 2007. This loss carry-forward is available to
offset possible future capital gains of the Money Market Portfolio.   

   Repurchase Agreements - Each Portfolio may agree to purchase money market
  instruments from financial institutions such as banks and broker-dealers
     subject to the seller's agreement to repurchase them at an agreed upon date
   and price ("repurchase agreements"). Collateral for repurchase agreements
    may have longer maturities than the maximum permissible remaining maturity
of portfolio investments. The seller under a repurchase agreement is  
   required on a daily basis to maintain the value of the securities subject
  to the agreement at not less than the repurchase price. The agreement is
   conditioned upon the collateral being deposited under the Federal Reserve
    book entry system or held in a separate account by the Fund's custodian or
     an authorized securities depository. All repurchase agreements were entered
into on December 31, 1999.                                            

    Estimated Maturities - The maturity of collateralized mortgage obligations
     and other asset backed securities may vary due to prepayments of principal.
 The maturity dates for these securities are estimates based on historic
prepayment factors.                                                   

 Variable Rate Obligations - For variable rate obligations, the interest
 rate presented is as of December 31, 1999 and the maturity shown is the
date of the next interest readjustment.                               

Management Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in     
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires     
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
   amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

C.   The Fund has entered into agreements for advisory, administrative, service 
agent, custodian and transfer agent services as follows:              

Government/REPO Portfolio and Money Market Portfolio - BlackRock      
   Institutional Management Corporation ("BIMC"), an indirect majority owned
subsidiary of PNC Bank National Association, serves as the Portfolios'
    investment advisor and service agent. As compensation for its services the
  Portfolios pay BIMC a fee, computed daily and paid monthly based upon an
 annualized percentage of the average daily net assets, at the following
   rate: .20% of the first $250 million, .15% of the next $250 million, .12%
of the next $250 million, .10% of the next $250 million, and .08% of  
amounts in excess of $1 billion.                                      

Short-Term Portfolio - Neuberger Berman ("NB"), a Delaware Limited    
 Liability Corporation, serves as the Portfolio's investment advisor. As
    compensation for its services, the Portfolio pays NB a fee, computed daily
   and paid monthly based upon an annualized percentage of the average daily
   net assets, at the following rate: .30% of the first $50 million, .20% of
     the next $50 million, .15% of the next $150 million, and .10% of amounts in
excess of $250 million.                                               

Health Plans Capital Services Corporation ("CSC") served as the Fund's
    administrator until March 31, 1999. Effective April 1, 1999, BCS Financial
Services Corporation ("BCS") serves as the Fund's administrator with  
     respect to the Fund's overall operations and relations with holders of PCs.
  As compensation for its services each Portfolio pays BCS a fee, computed
daily and payable monthly at an annual rate not to exceed .05% of the 
average daily net assets of each of the Fund's Portfolios.            

PFPC Trust Company ("PFPC Trust"), an affiliate of PNC Bank National  
     Association, acts as custodian of the Fund's assets and PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"),
  an affiliate of PNC Bank, acts as the Fund's transfer agent and dividend
disbursing agent. In addition, BIMC serves as the Short-Term Portfolio
 service agent. PFPC Trust, BIMC and PFPC receive fees from the Fund for
serving in these capacities.                                          

BIMC and NB have agreed contractually to reduce their advisory fees   
 otherwise payable to them in 1999 to the extent necessary to reduce the
    ordinary operating expenses of the Portfolios individually so that they do
not exceed 0.30 of one percent (0.30%) of each Portfolio's average net
    assets for the year. Under these contractual agreements, NB waived $95,864
of such fees payable by the Short-Term Portfolio for the period ended 
  December 31, 1999. BIMC voluntarily waived $45,389 of service agent fees
and CSC and BCS voluntarily waived $1,845 and $5,970, respectively, of
    administrator fees payable by the Short-Term Portfolio during this period.
     In addition, BIMC voluntarily waived $740 and $304,057 of advisory fees and
  CSC voluntarily waived $227 and $15,003 of administrator fees payable by
 the Money Market Portfolio and Government/REPO Portfolio, respectively,
     during this period. BCS voluntarily waived $20 and $52,920 of administrator
   fees payable by the Money Market Portfolio and Government/REPO Portfolio,
respectively, during this period.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Participation Certificate Holders and                                    
Trustees of Plan Investment Fund, Inc.:                                         

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of    
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all       
material respects, the financial position of the Government/REPO Portfolio, the 
Money Market Portfolio and the Short-Term Portfolio (constituting the Plan      
Investment Fund, Inc., hereafter referred to as the "Fund") at December 31,
1999, the results of each of their operations for the year then ended, the      
changes in each of their net assets for each of the two years in the period then
ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred 
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management;  
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in         
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States,     
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An    
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and  
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles    
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall   
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included    
confirmation of securities at December 31, 1999 by correspondence with the      
custodian, provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

        Define the whys, whens, and whats


        Roadmapping comes first, build what matters second
      







          Aha! is the one product management tool you need to lead product with conviction and be happy doing it. If you are like most product managers, Aha! is what you have always wanted to replace the Word, Google, Excel, Dropbox, and PPT docs that are scattered all over your hard drive and the cloud.
        











How does your product team work?
No matter what type of product team you work with, Aha! is a tool for driving product strategy, sharing your roadmap, and detailing features and user stories. We call this the why, when, and what of roadmapping. Engineering teams are responsible for how features get developed.



The Why
Goals and initiatives


The When
Schedules and timelines


The What
Releases and features


The How
Engineering development



We know that you are doing your best to explain where the product is headed, highlight the business value, and lead your product team. We also know that engineering teams can be demanding. They want to understand your vision for the product and they require detailed features and user stories to efficiently build what customers want. The reality is that it’s not easy with the product management tools you have.
How does your engineering team work?
While many engineering teams have a bug tracking system to manage their work, others do not. Aha! works in both environments but is fundamentally designed for you – the product manager. If your engineering team uses a bug system like JIRA, we integrate directly with it allowing you to set strategy, releases, and features in Aha! and send them to JIRA to be worked. As engineers work and update JIRA, Aha! is automatically updated and you can always easily check what's happening without having to navigate another tool.
Aha! also works well for teams that do not have a bug or other engineering planning system. Aha! provides a workflow board for agile or scrum teams, status controls by feature and requirement, and cross-functional release gantt charts so you are always informed. So, regardless of how your team works, Aha! is the product tool built for you.

Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits

Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

A mutual fund's annual operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net assets. It's calculated annually and removed from the fund's earnings before they're distributed to investors, directly reducing investors' returns.An expense ratio includes management, administrative, marketing, and distribution fees. It doesn't include loads or purchase or redemption fees.

footnote**For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 9 of 9 Vanguard money market funds, 51 of 54 Vanguard bond funds, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds, and 99 of 107 Vanguard stock funds—for a total of 182 of 193 Vanguard funds—outperformed their Lipper peer-group average.

footnote***The "Money 50" list published in the January/February 2017 Investor's Guide of Money magazine is based on mutual funds and ETFs that are low-cost and produce long-term returns that match or beat their benchmarks. Past performance cannot be used to predict future returns. Fund share prices will fluctuate, so investors could lose money if they sell when prices have fallen.
You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.

INVESTMENT PLANNING
Retirement Planning is not an easy job at all. Rising inflation numbers, slowing economy growth and too many financial products do not make life easy for any individual planning for retirement. Mis-selling of financial products by banks and other financial institutions has only doubled the customer’s confusion. Retirement has two phases – Accumulation and Distribution. Accumulation phase is the period where you accumulate the amount required for your needs post retirement. Distribution phase is where the accumulated corpus is distributed well to suffice the post retirement needs. Let us look into financial products for investment to build a strong portfolio for retirement: Construct a Total Return Portfolio One common way to create retirement income is to construct your own portfolio of stock and bond index funds (or work with a financial advisor who does this). The portfolio is designed to achieve a respectable long term rate of return, and along the way you follow a prescribed set of withdrawal rate rules that will typically allow you to take out 4-7% a year, and in some years, increase your withdrawal for inflation.The concept behind “total return” is that you are targeting a ten to twenty year average annual return that meets or exceeds your withdrawal rate. Although you are targeting a long term average, in any one year your returns will deviate from that average quite a bit. To follow this type of investment approach you must maintain a diversified allocation regardless of the year-to-year ups and downs of the portfolio. Use Retirement Income Funds Retirement income funds are a specialized type of mutual fund. They automatically allocate your money across a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, often by owning a selection of other mutual funds. The investments are managed with the goal of producing monthly income which is distributed to you. These funds are constructed to provide an all-in-one package that is designed to accomplish a particular objective. Immediate Annuities All annuities are really a form of insurance rather than an investment. I am including them on the best retirement investment list because their purpose is to produce income and that is what you need in retirement.There are fixed immediate annuities as well as variable immediate annuities. Some offer income that will increase with inflation, although that means you’ll start out receiving a lower monthly amount.You can also choose the term of the annuity, such as a ten year payout, a joint life payout (appropriate if you are married and want income for either of you that may be long-lived) or a single life payout. Buy Bonds When you buy a bond you loan your money to either the government, a corporation, or a municipality. The borrower agrees to pay you interest for a set amount of time and when the bond matures your principal is returned to you. The interest income, or yield, you receive from a bond (or from a bond fund) can be a steady source of retirement income.Buy bonds for the income they produce and/or for the guaranteed principal you will receive when they mature – don’t buy them expecting high returns or expecting to make a gain on capital appreciation.  Rental Real Estate Rental property can provide a stable source of income, but there will be maintenance requirements and when you own real estate you will inevitably incur unanticipated expenses. Before you buy rental property you need to calculate all the potential expenses you may incur over the expected time frame you think you will own the property. You also need to factor in vacancy rates – no property will be rented 100% of the time. Variable Annuity with a Lifetime Income Rider A variable annuity is a completely different type of investment than an immediate annuity. In a variable annuity your money goes into a portfolio of investments that you choose. You participate in the gains and losses in those investments, but for an additional fee you can add guarantees, called riders. Think of a rider like an umbrella - you may not need it but it is there to protect you in a worst-case scenario. Keep Some Safe Investments You always want to keep a portion of your retirement investments in safe alternatives. The primary goal of any safe investment is to protect what you have rather than generate a high level of current income.I recommend all retirees have some type of reserve account (an emergency fund). This account should not be included as an asset available to produce retirement income. It is there as a safety net; something to turn to for unforeseen expenses that may come up in retirement.In addition, if you are not sure what to do with your money, park it in a safe investment while you take the time to make an educated decision. Too many people rush to put their money into an investment because they feel like it should not be sitting in the bank for too long. They end up making a hurried decision. This is not a good idea. Income Producing Closed-End Funds The majority of closed end funds are designed to produce monthly or quarterly income. This income can come from interest, dividends, covered calls, or in some cases from a return of principal. Each fund has its own objective; some own stocks, others own bonds, some write covered calls to generate income, others use something called a dividend capture strategy. Be sure to do your research before buying.Experienced investors may find closed end funds to be an appropriate investment for a portion of their retirement money. Less experienced investors ought to avoid them or own them by using a portfolio manager who specializes in closed end funds.  Dividends and Dividend Income Funds Instead of buying individual stocks that pay dividends, you can choose a dividend income fund, which will own and manage dividend paying stocks for you. Dividends can provide a steady source of retirement income that may rise each year if companies increase their dividend payouts - but in bad times, dividends can also be reduced, or stopped all together. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is like a mutual fund that owns real estate. A team of professionals manage the property, collect rent, pay expenses, collect a management fee for doing so, and distribute the remaining income to you, the investor.REITs may specialize in a certain type of property, such as apartment buildings, office buildings, or hotels/motels. There are non-publicly traded REITs, typically sold by a broker or registered representative who receives a commission, as well as publicly traded REITs which trade on a stock exchange and can be bought by anyone with a brokerage account.When used as part of a diversified portfolio, REITs can be an appropriate retirement investment. Due to the tax characteristics of the income REITs generate, it may be best to hold this type of investment inside a tax deferred retirement account such as an IRA.

This is a do-It-yourself money management system. It was the first DIY Model-based investing system to become available in 2001. Most everyone else has since copied it, but still none have the performance - especially when markets are down.
We're still the only vendor with a viable fixed annuity alternative (AKA the 
Conservative High Income Models), and Models that use both mutual funds and ETFs (AKA the Hybrid Models).
It's also a complete turnkey investment portfolio building system for financial advisors.
What a turnkey system means is that all you'll have to do is insert the key (buy it), and then turn the crank (read the directions), and the machine spits out the finished product all ready to use in the Real World (actual investment portfolios).
You can hire us to manage your money according to any of our Models and/or Asset Allocation Software. So we'll do all of the rebalancing, fund switches, and all the usual 
maintenance for a flat $250 a month fee.
Retired investors, please consider the CHIM below before you get get stuck for life in a fixed annuity.
What Investing Models Are:
Model allocations are a very old investment strategy - probably even "the oldest trick in the book."
You may know it as: Managing Managers, Composites, Composite Portfolios, Asset Allocation Funds, or Fund of Funds (FoF). Other variations are in the text below. They're all the same thing, regardless of how the words are mixed up.

Model is the name given to something that represents a facsimile of the real thing. For example, a model airplane is designed to look like the real aircraft.
In this case, investment portfolios that actual investors own in the Real World look and act like the master investment portfolio models. So if there's $1B of assets in a master model, and you own $100,000 of it, then you'd have something small that looked, and acted, just like the real thing. This way you're able to get similar results of the whole pie, just by owning a slice.
The results will never be exactly the same, just similar. The only way an investor would own an exact investing model is if they initially bought all of the investment vehicles in the exact amounts, on the first trading day, the trades all settled the same day, all distributions were reinvested, they never made another trade other than the quarterly rebalancing and investment switches that occurred in the master model (and all of these trades settled on the same day), never put new money in, never paid taxes on it, and never redeemed shares.
None of that ever happens, so model investment portfolios are never the real thing. The actual results will be close, and sometimes even better, but never exactly the same as the master Model Portfolios.
Even though they are not real, model investment portfolios are very popular and helpful to get the point across. For financial advisers, they're the oldest and most-commonly-used standardized method of showing what actual investment portfolios would look like in terms of funding vehicles, risk, asset class mix, income yields, and what the historical performance has been.
If a pre-existing investment portfolio (a set mix of asset classes funded with specific investment vehicles) exists before one invests in it, then it's a Model Portfolio.
If a unique personalized investment portfolio is created, but did not exist beforehand, then it's not a Model Portfolio.
This image best sums up this investment strategy

There Are 13 Versions of the Regular Portfolio Models- plus 
a -Dynamic Target Date Retirement Model- and a -
Market Timing Calculator and Backtester
There are a total of 70 model allocations; because fourteen have five investment risk tolerance categories (Conservative, Moderately Conservative, Moderate, Moderately Aggressive, and Aggressive). Then there's three Conservative High-income Models and one Retirement Target Date Model, and one Market Timing Model.
Then the 
Dynamic Target Date Models information is here.
Plus, 
here's the investment calculator for modeling market timing strategies (this doesn't count as an investor model, but it uses the model allocations to backtest timing strategies).
The regular, static, passively-managed, investment models are:
• Five Hybrid Models using both mutual funds and ETFs. All returns are benchmarked from these, and not the Fee-Based Models starting in Jan '17.
• Five ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) Models for both investors managing their own money, and Fee-Based advisers that like ETFs.
• Five Fee-Based Models are for investment advisors working on an investment management fee basis (AKA an RIA using a Fee-Based custodian platform). Here 
mutual funds with front-end loads are bought at NAV (Net Asset Value, or in English, the initial sales charges on 
A-shares are waived so the investor doesn't pay them).
• Five all No-load Mutual Fund Models for DIY investors managing their own money, or investment advisors working on a fee-only basis (without access to A-share mutual funds at NAV).
• Five Benchmark Index Models. These are used for comparing passive investment management with active investment management (because they also serve as 
benchmark portfolios constructed specifically for this purpose).
The same asset classes and allocation weights as the other normal portfolio models with 17 asset classes are used, but they are funded with benchmark indices. They cannot be invested in like all of the other Model Portfolios, and so they just serve as a point of reference for comparison purposes (so model performance can be compared apples-to-apples after linking returns).
• Five all Front-end Loaded Mutual Fund Models for investment advisers working on a commission basis.
_____________________
All of the Model Portfolios above have their returns linked to account for switches, rebalancings, fees, asset class weight changes, etc. So all returns since Jan '99 or Jan '17 are actual, whereas all of the returns of the Models below are hypothetical (because they just show past returns using current funding vehicles, which changed in the past).
The Benchmark Index Models have actual returns without needing a spreadsheet to calculate them, because there are no fees or switches (but they are not rebalanced nor adjusted for past weight changes). Why? Because nobody does that, like they're supposed to. When everyone is doing that, then we'll do that too.
_____________________
• Five Index Fund Models for both investors managing their own money and fee-only professionals that like to use index funds. These have two less asset classes than the regular portfolio models because there are no index funds for them yet (15 total).
All of the index mutual fund picks are no-load, under $5,000 minimum initial investment, and there are no Load-waived funds, so any investor can buy them.
So this is the asset allocation mix solution if you don't want to keep up with someone else's mutual fund picks and changes. Just index and rebalance.
Because of yet another Morningstar failure, and lack of interest that hasn't been there for over a decade (since ETFs came out), Index Funds are not screened and Index Fund Models are not maintained anymore. They're still there, but unless you say you want it refreshed, it's not updated anymore.
• Two sets of investing models for $60,000 minimum accounts (ten models total). The same five-investment risk tolerance categories use only 13 asset classes here. This allows you to get the benefits of this passive investment management strategy, with only $60,000 worth of either no-load or front-end load mutual funds.
• Two sets of investor models for $20,000 minimum accounts. They have the same five-investment risk tolerances and use eight asset classes. This allows you to get the benefits of this static investing management strategy with only $20,000 worth of either no-load or front-end load mutual funds.
• Five asset allocator models made from the no-load variable annuity discussed on this page. Their 357 subaccounts were optimized down to fifteen asset classes. Now Fee-Based advisers can get their clients to exchange their VAs into this, and then charge them AUM fees for managing it.
• Five allocation models made from only American Funds. We optimized their 22 mutual funds down to nine asset classes.
• Three hypothetical Conservative High-income Models (AKA CHIMs) for investors wanting to squeeze as much yield as possible out of a conservative mutual fund asset allocation. It's even more conservative than our Conservative Models.
The CHIMs use normal mutual funds and ETFs, so there is nothing "guaranteed" nor "insured" about them whatsoever. Also, because they have such a high allocation of fixed income, their principle value will go down more than the other investing Models when interest rates go up - even though allocations are more conservative than the regular Conservative Models. Read why you shouldn't fear fixed income mutual funds, or ETFs, when interest rates increase.
If you have enough money in it, then you can set it up so it completely eliminates account draw-downs. This is because the total account value would only go down when the markets go down or interest rates go up. The point of the CHIMs are to make it so you'll realize maximum income distributions to spend. This makes it so you don't have to sell shares. So if you don't sell shares, and the markets don't go down, then there are no draw-downs at all - just the opposite most of the time (in "normal times" - when bonds actually yield something - like they will in a 
few years or so if interest rates keep going back up to normal pre-meltdown levels). So the CHIMs are sort of the "magic solution" to most all mundane concerns like this.
The CHIMs are for retired, or soon to be retired investors, that just want to set everything up on autopilot and then ignore the outside world. Because you don't sell shares, this makes all forms of fear-based news irrelevant and easier to ignore, while getting a relatively safe yield in the 
6% range (and slowly growing as interest rates go back up). So regardless of how scary the world is, you just do nothing but make the monthly fund switches (if any), and just let it do its thing (putting interest, dividend, and capital gains distributions into your checking account for you to spend). The CHIM helps make it so you can do mostly nothing, and get a big fat safe yield to spend. So this is the opposite of what investors want if they're prone to overreactions that makes them sell equity shares every time the news wants to scare them (into buying gold).
There's a Fee-Based CHIM and then the same thing was duplicated using all no-load, and all loaded mutual funds. ETFs were looked at too, but none had better yields than mutual funds, so project abandoned. All of the text below is only for the Fee-Based Conservative High-Income Model.
Yield is the combined distributions of an investment and is part of total return. For a mutual fund, it's the combined dividends the fund takes (realizes). These are the taxable events, which if you choose not to reinvest, end up in your cash (sweep, or money market) account. Mutual fund yields are calculated like this:
Annual Yield = Dividends / (NAV + Capital Gains Distributions)
The last 12-months Fee-Based CHIM's income yield was 6.7% and the total return was 
20.0%. These are hypothetical because they don't account for past fund switches, rebalancings, or allocation changes.
This investing model is very different than the regular models because its goal is to maximize income yield, not beat any benchmark index. So the history of returns have are not maintained. You can see the YTD and last three year returns on the investing model demo.
Here's an estimate of how these numbers work out: If you'd invested $100 one-year ago at the beginning of last month, and the total return was 
20% and the yield was 6.7%, then now you'd have ~$6.70 in cash to spend (in your money market / cash / sweep account), and in addition to that, the fund would still be worth ~$113.30 (because no shares needed to be sold to get the income yield).
This means you could sell all or any amount of the ~$113.30 at any time for any reason. This is something you CANNOT do with CDs, real estate, annuitized annuities, limited partnerships, large individual bonds, private stock and options, gold, etc.
Investors are also loathe to sell stocks and mutual funds when they're down, so you usually "cannot do that" either. So right off the bat, the CHIM's high liquidity may literally save your life (if you really really need your money).
Then the number of mutual fund shares you owned would always be the same, and so you'd have ~$6.70 of income to report on your taxes (assuming the mutual funds were not in a Roth IRA). How much in taxes would vary as the composition of dividends, capital gains, and interest income would be random based on what the funds actually distributed.
This may not look like much, but on average it's twice the yield on all of our other investing models (and even more compared to what most everyone else is getting).
This is because it's  another unique invention from T4$, so nobody else has this. It takes five to ten years for investors to catch on and start copying our work. For example, all Robo-adviser sites are basically offering the exact same things as our Models (so it took them from '98 to '14 to copy and automate our Models (they wanted to do it much sooner, but the technology wasn't available yet). Some were even our customers that tried to get us to join their Robo adventures around 2012. The only difference is that Robos charge rock-bottom prices for their cookie-cutting one-size-fits-all non-personalized services running on insecure cloud servers. Whereas with ours, it's 100% secure mostly all custom work (where the investor can have input on how their money is invested).
So if you look at the yields of everyone else's Models, including the Robos, then you'll see that cloud-based automation still has years to go before it catches up with live money managers. And if they do copy the CHIM, then we'll sue big time for copyright infringement.
So the bottom line between our seminal Investment Models, and copycat Robo Models, are the returns and the fees. Keep checking the returns on these pages, because this is one area where fintech won't win (because our returns will most always be better, even after our 1% annual AUM fees for live clients with live accounts with our CA RIA). Regardless of how fintech progresses, one can never escape the mundane State of Humanity - "There ain't no free lunch, and in one way or another, you get what you pay for!"
There's more about Robos below the table of 
returns.
The most important thing is this (if you set it up and manage it correctly): The number of mutual fund shares you owned will most always be the same after you get paid your retirement income paycheck, as it was before you got paid!
Good luck trying to find something that performs this function, with these returns and low risk, for this price!
Then in Jan '17, the SEC started saying they're going to put more resources into regulating Robos too. So the free lunch may be coming to an end sooner than you think. what this will do 
For example, the yield on the optimized Conservative American Funds Model was only ~1.4% and the last 12-months return was ~1.6% (and this does not account for the sales loads).
So if you had a million bucks in the Conservative American Funds Model, your monthly retirement paycheck, from just yield, would only be ~$1,000.
With the Fee-Based CHIM, it would have been ~$6,167.
So this resulted in having ~517% more retirement paycheck compared to investing the obsolete 80's "American way."
So in order to receive the same amount of retirement check with American Funds, you'd have to constantly sell shares. This will probably make your nest egg run out before you pass away.
With the CHIM, you probably wouldn't need to sell shares to get a decent yield and retirement paycheck; so when you pass away, there's a better chance that you'd still have around your original million bucks intact.
Even worse, if you gave your million dollar nest egg to a life insurance company in exchange for the usual plain vanilla fixed annuity, not only would you probably realize even less retirement income than with American Funds (~10% less), it wouldn't even keep up with cost of living inflation at all (unless you paid the insurance premiums for an inflation rider, then you'd get about 15% less paycheck than by using American Funds).
Then when you pass away, your heirs would receive nada bupkiss el zilcho (unless you paid the insurance premium to provide a death benefit, then you'd get about 15% less paycheck than with American Funds).
So if you combine the cost of these two needed insurance contracts to insure for these two huge risks, which are 100% certain to happen, you're making around 20% to 25% less spendable income in a fixed annuity than with American Funds.
So this adds up to be around 70% to 80% less retirement income paycheck than the CHIM would probably provide over your retirement years.
This is why all of this boring stuff matters and why you need to wake up and pay attention ASAP to what's really going on in life, and not just what a salesperson is feeding just you to get their huge immediate commissions.
One also must factor in risk and total return when considering how high or low yield is. This model's income is extremely high considering the low risk (because of the extreme diversification and low equity exposure) and relatively high total return.
Taking that into account, this compromise between high yield, low-risk, and high total return is better than anything else we've ever seen (if someone has a better investment strategy to get higher yields with less risk, then we'd be doing that too).
These yields were a lot higher in 2010, but after banning fund families that abuse leverage and derivatives, play shenanigans and other tricks that make the fixed-income parts of the portfolio not be conservative (e.g., PIMCO), it's down. The bright side of that is that the yields are much more stable, the funds are a lot more conservative, shenanigans by the funds are mostly eliminated, and thus are more suitable for retired investors.
This is as good as it gets, and is ideal for investors that don't want to sell shares to raise money to spend on living expenses.
If you do your research, you'll see it's extremely difficult to get this rate of income without selling anything; all while realizing low-risk, good returns, and the other 
advantages of using only open-ended mutual funds (low costs, extreme diversification, liquidity, transparency, etc.).
If you're retired and need money from an investment portfolio to live off of, then this may help make it last a lot longer. This is because the more income distributions a portfolio sheds without selling shares, the fewer shares you'll need to sell to get the paycheck you need, and the fewer shares you sell, the more money you're going to have later.
Also the more conservatively a portfolio is constructed, the longer it will last too, especially when the markets are down.
Once you sell shares, they do not just magically grow back (if you're spending all of the distributions instead of reinvesting them, which is what you'll do with this Model Portfolio). In other words, if you spend the income, the only way to have more shares is to invest more money.
Capital gains taxes are also kept to a minimum when you don't redeem shares for income. There's no profits to report if you don't sell and realize any gains. You'll be realizing and spending the internal realized capital gains distributions though.
So two of the main tricks to not run out of money when you reach an advanced age is to not sell shares, and never invest in any form of "self-destructing bonds" or these types of bond ETFs or mutual funds, as explained in the 
free Money eBook.
While on the subject, here's the way we like to think about the value of paying an advisor to construct an investment portfolio for the purpose of producing a sustainable retirement paycheck: Take the total amount of their fees, expenses, and commissions and divide that by the amount of income realized over the past year (don't count share sales as income, just dividends and capital gains distributions).
If it's more than 20%, then you'd probably do a better job of managing your money yourself using our CHIM, you'd probably get a higher yield with a higher overall rate of return with less risk, you'd end up selling many less shares, worrying about trust, ethics, security, and privacy issues would be history, and you'd save all of their fees and commissions - forever!
For example, if you have a $1M portfolio, pay 1% in fees, and are getting 5% income (without selling shares), then you're paying 20% of your income in fees. More than 20% and we think you'd be better off doing it yourself, and not paying any of their fees anymore. More than likely, you've only been getting ~3% income yield, and they've been selling shares, so this would yield 40% of your income going to pay the advisor. This is way too high, so DIY!
Also, the CHIM is just about the only "thing" you can just buy, read the directions, and use; that will help you set up and manage tiny endowment-like funds. As long as your average spending yield is lower than the CHIM's average yield, then that will perform this function - without having to hire actuaries or a team of expensive investment advisors that specialize in

endowment fund investing. In other words, the CHIM is the money tool that does this job as close as you can get without spending "real money" on the project.

Also, while on the subject: 
Why fixed annuities are NOT the answer when it comes to getting a retirement paycheck from your nest egg (and why you shouldn't fear buying bond mutual funds when you think interest rates are about to go up). There's more math and evidence that this is the best way to get retirement income on the fixed annuity page (click the link above)


The Asset Allocation Models Include:
• All of the 65 model allocations described above.
• The mutual fund picks spreadsheet for all 22 asset classes. These portfolio models only use 17 asset classes (the other five asset classes are for use with the comprehensive asset allocator software). There's 22 mutual fund recommendations, times five ways of managing money, totaling over 100 monthly-updated investment recommendations.
To keep everything updated and balanced, you can also subscribe to keep these models and/or just the mutual fund recommendations fresh on a monthly basis. You'll receive the reasons for all switches to decide whether or not to sell the old mutual fund and buy the new one.
• Sometimes, there's a short "investment newsletter" for subscribers explaining what happened over the last month regarding the models, mutual fund selections, generic site information, and sometimes market commentary.
• A sheet for inputting a comparison portfolio. This has two purposes:
First, it allows for quick and easy rebalancing of actual portfolios, compared with one of the models of your choice. This shows how much the actual allocation mix is off by, both in percentage and dollar amounts. This tells you exactly how much to buy or sell in each asset class (with tickers) to bring the portfolio back into balance.
Then you can compare the asset allocations, the returns, and the differences in returns, between the model allocations and the actual portfolio held.
There is also a matrix of these returns, and the differences between the actual investment portfolio. It also displays past portfolio returns, and the asset allocation mix of the comparison / actual portfolio. Some of this can be seen on the demo.
• Over 50 charts graphically show all of the asset allocations, and the actual / comparison Model Portfolio.
• Five html files that may help you use model asset allocations with 401k plans. Once you buy the models, or have the 

free Money eBook, you'll also get step-by-step directions on 
how to better allocate a 401(k) plan by yourself.
• Three spreadsheets showing the linked returns and mutual fund switches since inception for the Fee-Based (since 1/99), and the No-Load and Load Models (since 1/03).
Linking returns uses the "Time Weighted" methodology, and is the standard used in accounting for past trades when calculating historical investment performance. You can use all three of these spreadsheets to audit the returns yourself. About this, and how the returns are calculated, are in the directions.
Other Information
• If you use a third-party money manager, and they charge 50bps, then for every million you have with them, you're giving up $50,000 a year of gross income. Our investing system allows you to keep all of your money, while most likely realizing better returns with less risk.
• The most valuable feature, is that this system allows you to create investment portfolios that are ready to be implemented in the Real World. This is called a turnkey system. What this means is that all you have to do is insert the key (buy it), then turn the crank (read the directions), and the machine spits out the finished product all ready to use in the Real World (your portfolio).
We use Morningstar for their mutual fund database to pick the mutual funds every month, and that's all (it costs ~$700 a year and they raise their prices ~15% every year).
Our investing software gives you both a great investment strategy, and the funding vehicle recommendations, but doesn't have this vast database needed to evaluate strategies nor the investment vehicles used.
So advisors may need both if they want to use our models as a framework to create other models.
But if you don't want to do that, or if you're a DIY investor, then you won't even need Morningstar if you have our system, because everything is already done for you. So this turnkey money management system makes it so you won't need to buy or use any other investment software.
• All mutual fund asset allocations display their last 12-months income yield, except the benchmark index allocation models, which don't have yields.
• The portfolio models, mutual fund selections, and all of the portfolio returns are updated and sent out to subscribers around two days after the first trading day of each month. Yes, this used to be mid-month, but we had to migrate to Morningstar's AWS, so the big advantage there is being able to update on the first trading day of the month now.
• Advisers can input their own fees and trading cost numbers into the Fee-Based Model's Linked Returns spreadsheet to see how the returns change.
• These same asset allocation model concepts can also be used with variable annuities, variable life insurance (VUL), 401k / 457 / 403bs, 529 plans, and with just one mutual fund family like we do for American Funds (or using as many fund families as you want).
• Most investment managers' models do not account for past trades, so the actual returns investors' realize are usually 10% to 30% less than what's advertised via their hypothetical returns. The only way to see how well a strategy is really doing is to run the actual numbers. You can see these differences using our Aggressive Fee-Based Model on the chart of comparison returns on the main 
asset allocation primer page. This is explained in detail in the 
directions.
Using the Table of Historical Investment Model Returns
First, the Fee-Based Models are old news and the Hybrid Models are the latest and greatest thing. Starting January '17, everything is being benched from the Hybrid models. So if you're a money manager, don't use and ignore the returns of the Fee-Based Models. The only reason for using the Fee-Based Models going forward, is if you're a financial adviser, and for whatever reason, you don't want to use ETFs. Investors should use the either the Hybrid Models, ETF Models, or the No-Load Models (in that order - if you want what Investing Models do - which is give you extreme diversification to minimize risks).
Next, if you're comparing performance to another not-T4$ Model, then you should know that the chances that their returns have been linked to account for past investment vehicle changes, rebalancings, and asset class weight changes are slim to none, and Slim left town.
So once you're sure they have just been using past returns from their current hot picks, instead of properly accounting for for their losing picks along the way, then do not use returns below that are linked. Use the hypo returns below that have not been linked. This way, you are comparing apples-to-apples, and not something that looks good because it's fake, compared to something that is real. If there's returns on our site for only than three years, then they are not linked. Other than the Hybrid Models, only sets of returns showing five years or more have been linked.
We know that 99.9% of all money manager's returns have not been linked, because we tried to offer that as a service to advisers. It's a lot of work, so it's a lot of money, so nobody ever did that. Ones we've talked with in person had zero stomach for paying over $1,000 to shine the spotlight of truth onto their work - even if it looked like they've been outperforming their competition. If so, then that $1,000 paid to us to do the work would have been returned to them many times over, because they can use that to easily take accounts away from their competition. So it's yet another example of financial advisors being "penny wise and pound foolish."
So the bottom line is that is very rare that any return you see from a diversified investment portfolio of any kind is actual. So the standard language used to describe portfolio returns that are not linked, is hypothetical. The point is that hypo returns can be several times greater than actual returns, as you can see by comparing both from the same Portfolio Models below.
So the bottom line is to only compared hypo to hypo, and actual to actual. Since only ~0.1% of money managers maintain actual returns, you'll be comparing hypo to hypo most all of the time.
The table below shows the actual returns for the Fee-Based Model Portfolios. They are "actual" and not "hypothetical" as shown in the
demo.
These are the actual returns from inception (1 January 1999) showing the returns as if you initially bought all of the investment vehicles in the exact amounts, on the first trading day, the trades all magically settled the same day, all distributions were reinvested, you never made another trade other than the monthly rebalancing and investment switches that occurred in the master model (and all of these trades settled on the same day), never put new money in, never paid taxes on it, and never redeemed shares.
Compare these results to what you, or your advisors, have been getting. They are probably much better. Why? Because buy-and-hold passive asset allocation strategies work better than stock or ETF picking or market timing. When you think about it, that's all there is to do, there is nothing else other than speculating with derivatives or buying life insurance company products. All of this is just that simple. Read a summary, or go here or here or here or here for more details.
The great debate that's been going on since the beginning of time is finally over: Can active investment management ever consistently profit more than passive management, after expenses?
These investing models are proof that active management works, and the cost is so low that it's almost insignificant. As long as you don't try to pick stocks / ETFs and/or time Markets with the investing models, and use mutual funds that even slightly outperform their asset classes, you can sometimes beat the markets while being extremely diversified. But not always - 
nowadays ETFs are the tail that wag the market dog, so nobody is "beating the markets anymore"
The returns shown below are also NOT due to luck. They are very consistent over the time we've been tracking them (1995, but the history of trades was not recorded until '98). There have been only a couple dozen months (out of 217) when the Moderate Index Model beat the Fee-Based Moderate or Aggressive Model. If these returns were due to luck, then it would have been around half of the time.
You can see the current hypothetical numbers compared to the Index Model by looking at the demo's charts. 
Also the actual performance for the Fee-Based Moderate or Aggressive Model compared to the Index Model is on the table of historical investing returns here.
On the demo screen print, you can also see all of the current relevant portfolio statistics, like alpha, beta, standard deviation, etc. (these came from the 
asset allocation software, and are not part of the investing models).
See a table of asset class returns on the
mutual fund picks page that show how and why correlation coefficients of asset allocation work so well (all of this is AKA Modern Portfolio Theory, or MPT).
The most Real World thing to do when looking at the table below, is to compare the Moderate or Aggressive Model (or the Fee-Based Moderate Model Portfolio when markets are down) with the S&P 500 over the various time frames. The longer the time frame, the more meaningful the comparisons are.
The returns are after all mutual fund fees and expenses (e.g., 12b-1s) are taken into account. But they don't account for annual management fees that a professional investment advisor would charge a client. This is because those are estimated and accounted for on the three links here:
See the table of returns assuming you charge your clients 0.5% annual management fees (low)
See the table of returns assuming you charge your clients 1.0% annual management fees (average)
See the table of returns assuming you charge your clients 1.5% annual management fees (high)

More About Robo-Advisers
The long-term failure with Robos will be caused by the short-term success of their one and only asset-gathering magic trick - rock-bottom fees. This is all they have - the fintech that automatically invests your money via a cookie-cutter asset allocation mix. One person (like me) gave their Models to a coder, and they made it so when money hits the account, the algorithm automatically invests into a Model Portfolio. Because the money manager doesn't have to manually care for the money, they only have to do the work once, instead of several times a day. This is how they lower their expenses and seem to make everything magically happen "for free."
There's too many problems to list with this - are they swapping old vehicles for new ones efficiently? Are they any good at that? Are they rebalancing, when, what are their triggers and ranges, and at what level? Are they any good at that? How are they maintaining the asset class weights, and are they using market timing to do that? Are they any good at that? Are they using both mutual funds and ETFs - which are now required to be competitive (using both all mutual funds or all ETFs is a recipe for sub-par investment performance)? Are they any good at that? Do they know when to use a fund or an ETF? Are they any good at that? Are they adequately maintaining their compliance and legal requirements? Are they any good at that? That's very expensive, so probably not. So it's just a matter of time before all of those chickens come home to roost.
The answers will be in their returns, which so far, are just similar to our Index Fund Models, which are  bad when compared to our actively managed Model Allocations. You get what you pay for, and know it or not, you're paying for good returns while getting adequate risk reduction via diversification, no market timing, and good vehicle selection and allocations. That can only be so good for so long when the people doing the high-value work are being paid "rock bottom-Robo wages."
Then it's not just people at the Robo firm being underpaid - their business models dictates that everyone involved in the process work in the "race to the bottom" rock-bottom-low-pricing world. So it's only a matter of time before their relationship with their vendors breaks too, because eventually, they're going to wake up and want to be paid enough money to survive too.
The deal with enticing investors with uber-low fees, is that the very few people with brain cells working there haven't been paid, are not getting paid now, and they won't be getting reasonably paid in the future - ever.
So sure, it may look spiffy and seem like a good deal now, but eventually, the money manager(s) maintaining the asset allocations will get a grip on the reality that their paycheck will 
always be a small fraction of what they can earn just about anywhere else, and/or by starting their own firm, and they'll quit. Then they'll be replaced by lesser and lesser qualified money managers every time this happens.
Then most Robos offer no control, and some think that's good by making their program not allow you to sell when the market goes down. Only they know if it will prevent you from buying when the market goes up too. A few market downturns ago (probably Brexit), Betterment wouldn't allow you to sell anything at all until they felt the irrational panic was over.
While typing about Betterment - we were sort of involved in the whole process in 2015, when Tony Robbins was deciding which way to go with the Robo thing. He considered us, according to our middleman. So I did the math on that. Everything seemed like it was a good deal for him (Tony), the other owners, low-level employees, and investors.
But when I took expected gross income, minus expenses (including the low-level employees), to get net income - and then divided that by the number of high-value employees, it turned out that they're making about $100,000 a year. The point is that's about one quarter of what someone at that level could make if they got a job on Wall Street, and/or started their own firm. So the bottom line is it's only a matter of time before the people that perform the most important functions at Betterment realize the honeymoon is over, they wake up, and quit for more compensation. Another point is this is the exact same situation that all Robos Advisers are in. So look for changes there in a few years (in the form of much higher AUM fees). End of the Betterment digression.
This is sort of the same as hiring a normal money manager with full discretion (which means they can do whatever they want with your money anytime they want, without telling you, but within boundaries), but there you can always tell them what to do, and they do it (and/or what to not do).
Robos will just tell you no, give you no control, and then if their magic algorithm makes a market timing mistake, then a bazillion times more money could be lost than you've saved in fees. Also, just wait for their algorithm to fail, just like all code does, and make millions of erroneous trades (which cannot be undone). Or they get hacked and load up on pork bellies just for fun.
Without paying humans good money to constantly keep an eye on things, anything and everything can and will eventually go wrong. That was the first and most important thing the old portfolio manager told me as I was replacing him in 1998 - you always have to check, double-check, and triple-check everyone's work every time, or there will be a very expensive, time-consuming, and unfixable failure).
So when your minimal staff is minimally compensated (to keep the fees rock-bottom), that opens the door to too many potential failures to type about here. If I was the head of the SEC, I'd put a blanket ban on all forms of Robos, just for this reason alone. One of the most probable things the SEC will do is make them add human staff until the point is reached where they feel Robos are safe. The point is, hiring all of those people will make their fees go up, which will make the high-value people quit because of the added annoyances combined with the fact that if they are any good, then they could be making five to tens times more down the street. This will lower returns, increase risk, and make them much less competetive compared to human money managers. When the free lunch starts to taste not so good, then they will go away.
So eventually, each one will self-implode with neglect, mistakes, failures, then the regulators will add uber-expenses to their deals (if they don't just kill off the whole deal entirely, which is what some say they want) - and all of this will show in their after-expense returns. Then investors will start to bail when they see there really is no free lunch and you get what you pay for. They have have realized a bargain for a few years, but then their after-fee returns will be less than hiring a Real World asset manager, and they'll return to them en mass.
So in a few years, Robo investors will flee en mass, and return to what works best for everyone long-term - DIY or hiring actual hands-on money managers. Especially when the SEC gets through with them, making them spend BIG money staying compliant - thus raising their expenses, and then their fees will go back up to levels where it makes no sense anymore - because their one and only magic trick will be gone forever. If the government doesn't change, kill off, or make the whole business model not work for another long list of reasons over the next year or so.
Articles About Robos and the Upcoming SEC Clampdown
These Investor Models, and the Comprehensive Asset Allocation Software, are two different programs, with different pricing tables. So the most frequently asked question is...

"What's the Difference Between the Asset Allocation Software and these Asset Allocation Models?"
With the asset allocation software, unlike allocation models which exist before someone is around to invest in them, the investor submits various life factors needed to calculate a custom allocation mix that reflects their life situation. So it's not just using one of a few generic pre-existing model allocations (there's dozens of asset class mix combinations).
Model portfolios only take one life factor into account - 
investment risk tolerance category. This is determined by 
filling out and scoring an investment fact finder. There's little-to-no "work" involved. You'd just determine risk tolerance, allocate money according to the model's asset class weights, and then make the trades.
The comprehensive asset allocation calculator also takes risk tolerance into account as the most important factor in determining the mix, but it also uses a few more life factors.
With the asset allocation calculator, the currently-held investment mix is then compared to the recommended mix of asset classes.
Then investments are shuffled around to create the proposed mix (the new investment recommendations, AKA proposed snapshot).
It then displays current and proposed snapshots that can be analyzed and compared.
Then future projections can be made given various assumptions. This allows complete control over most every aspect of the asset allocation process.
Model portfolios only show investment recommendations (the proposed snapshot), and mostly ignores the currently-held investment portfolio.
So with the comprehensive asset allocation software, there's work involved in creating an investment portfolio that's custom tailored to fit the investor's life. This makes it best suited for larger clients that are paying an advisor enough to make it worth doing the extra work (or doing it yourself).
Our regular portfolio models only use 17 asset classes, and the asset allocation calculator accommodates an unlimited amount (we screen mutual fund asset classes for 22).
The models have less asset classes to minimize the amount of money needed to buy everything. It's currently around $100k to buy the Fee-Based Moderate Model (less for the other four allocations because they don't use every asset class (plus there's also $60k and $20k models for that).
You don't subscribe to the allocation software, because it doesn't change monthly. You'd only subscribe to the mutual fund selections to keep the funding vehicles current.
It's best to subscribe to the models to keep portfolios updated with both fresh funding vehicles and allocation changes.
For DIY investors, the choice of using the investing models or the asset allocation software shouldn't be governed by how much money you have. It just should depend on how much time and work you're willing to put into matching your portfolio(s) to your life.
Using the portfolio models is fast, easy, and simple. Once you know your risk tolerance category, everything is done except making the trades.
The asset allocation calculator is complex and will take an extra hour to create your investment portfolio, but it will match your life better.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
