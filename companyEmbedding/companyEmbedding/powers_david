David Francis Powers, Special Assistant to President John F. Kennedy.


David Francis Powers (April 25, 1912 – March 27, 1998)[1] was Special Assistant and assistant Appointments Secretary to President of the United States John F. Kennedy. Powers served as Museum Curator of the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum from 1964 until his retirement in May 1994.[2] Powers was a military veteran who had served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II from 1942 to 1945. Powers was also a very close, personal friend of John F. Kennedy.

Life and career[edit]
The son of Irish immigrants, Powers was born in the Charlestown section of Boston.[1] His father died when he was two-years old.[1]
During the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Powers and Kenneth P. O'Donnell were riding in the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine and are seen in the famous Zapruder film. In 1996, the Assassination Records Review Board released three-minutes of film footage captured by Powers in Dallas prior to the assassination.[3] Powers said he began filming when the motorcade left Love Field but ran out of film at 12:17 p.m before reaching Dealey Plaza.[3]
Powers and Kenneth O'Donnell co-authored "Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye" (Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1972). ISBN 0-316-71625-1
On March 28, 1998 Power died of cardiac arrest in Arlington, Massachusetts at the Symmes Medical Center.[1]
Powers' granddaughter, Jenny Powers, gained fame as a Broadway actress and performer. An ardent Democrat like her grandfather, she was asked to sing the National Anthem at the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
Allegations of impropriety[edit]
Judith Campbell Exner in her 1977 autobiography Judith Exner: My Story alleged that Powers assisted in setting up encounters with President Kennedy. Powers would later state that Kennedy never had an affair with Exner.[4] In her 2012 book, Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath, Mimi Alford claimed that once she was swimming with President Kennedy while David Powers looked on and she got out of the pool and gave Powers oral sex after the President had swum over to her and whispered in her ear the instruction to do so.[5]

 Brent Fessler, crew member, David Powers, and John Riley. Photo courtesy: John RileyPowers, David. (Dubuque, IA-- ). In October 1970 Powers left work at the JOHN DEERE DUBUQUE WORKS to work at the Kopper Ford auto dealership on Central Avenue. Powers was in charge of parts and service and then became general manager. 
Prior to the company's move to the west side of Dubuque along Dodge, he bought in as a partner. The partnership also purchased the  Terry McGarth Volkswagen-Mercedes dealership then adjacent to BIRD CHEVROLET and a dealership on the western edge of Galena, Illinois. The Kopper-Powers partnership was dissolved in 1972 with Powers buying the Ford dealership and Kopper purchasing the Volkswagen-Mercedes operation. Powers sold the Ford dealership in 1977. The business had one owner before Mike Finnin purchased the dealership.

Powers and John William RILEY began a partnership when Riley worked part-time as a gas station mechanic and Powers stopped in to see the work being done on the cars. In 1958 the two set a goal of reaching the top in the world of drag racing. Riley had years of experience as a top-flight mechanic and Powers supplied the nerves and skills of a great driver. 
In 1968, Powers won the United Drag Racers Association circuit championship. In 1969, he placed second in the Hot Rodding Magazine Championships. Ending his absence from the sport in early 2000, Powers re-entered the National Hot Rod Association as a team owner. In 2006 the Valvoline/David Powers Homes Top Fuel dragster stood at No. 6 in the world rankings. In 2007 Rod "Hot Rod" Fuller raced to his second straight Top Fuel victory in the Valvoline/David Powers Homes dragster with a 4.490-second run at 327.19 mph to claim his fourth career victory and take the series points lead for the first time in his career.
In an article in the Telegraph Herald in 2006 the two men claimed their success was due to never blaming each other. 

 Photo courtesy: John Riley
Nicknamed the "Hicks from the Sticks," the two worked their regular jobs, ate dinner and rested, and then worked on their cars until midnight. Friday began the weekend of racing.

 Photo courtesy: John RileyIn addition to winning races, the Powers & Riley team pioneered advances in racing. The partners designed and manufactured racing innovations which became standard equipment. Riley believes his team was the first to experiment with a "reverser" in its fuel dragster in 1967. Designed and built by Powers and Riley in Dubuque, the aluminum reverser allowed dragsters to backup. The component gave the Powers and Riley team a definite advantage for several years, but they manufactured the parts in Dubuque, assembled them locally, and sold them to other racers to use.
Powers and Riley also led the way in the development of adjustable clutches. Most racers then used clutches with triple discs and customary pressure plates with different spring pressures. After a competition, the unit needed to be taken apart and a new plate inserted. Powers and Riley developed a method by which the driver adjusted the clutch using an Allen wrench through the housing.
When the partners went into the Funny Car category, they were the leaders in experimenting with direct-drive units. Most funny cars used automatic transmissions, spring rear suspensions and regular differentials. The Power & Riley Mustang used direct drive prior to 1970.
Powers left Dubuque after the sale of the Ford dealership and became a highly successful home builder. In 2007, for the fourth year in a row, David Powers Homes was honored by The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year award and was given the 2007 ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award in recognition of its continued leadership in protecting the environment through energy efficiency. The company was the only Houston, Texas builder to boast such an achievement.

For the good that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.Romans 7:19,22-23
