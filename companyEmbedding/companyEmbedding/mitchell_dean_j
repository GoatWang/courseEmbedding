Employees







Mitchell, Dean J
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Mitchell, Dean J carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Mitchell, Dean J



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Mitchell, Dean J



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

          "Pat" Paderewski (1908-2007)
          Paderewski, Mitchell and Dean
Clarence
            Joseph
            "Pat" Paderewski was born on July 23, 1908 in Cleveland,
            Ohio. His family moved to Los Angeles in 1920. Following his graduation
            from Benjamin Franklin High School in Los Angeles (in 1926), Pat
            attended one year at UCLA and completed his BA in Architecture
            in 1932 at Cal Berkeley
One year after moving
              to San Diego in 1935,  Mr. Paderewski would garner 3rd prize in
              the National Design Competition of a Residence for Structural Clay
              Products (1936). Mr. Paderewski began teaching drafting,
              architecture and related subjects in 1939 for San Diego Unified
              School District. Between teaching Evening High School (1939-1944),
              War Training Program (1943-1944) and UC Extension (1944-1957) classes,
              C.J. Paderewski would define himself as more than an architect
              but a real contributor to San Diego. He opened his first office
              in 1944.
In 1946 Mr. Paderewski
              assumed the responsibility (on behalf of the AIA) of "working
              with one of the San Diego Evening newspapers in furnishing an article
              each week, together with photographs or sketches, of a house designed
            by an architect." 
During a long
              career leading his firm with partners Delmar S. Mitchell and Louis
              A. Dean (Paderewski, Mitchell and Dean AIA Architects), Pat would
              stake claim on a number of "firsts". Pat was "the first architect
              to advocate the use of colors in elementary schools" he led the
              John J. Montgomery School in Otay to be the first school (in 1946)
              "in which interesting colors were used in interiors and exteriors."
              Recognized for designing the first school to utilize radiant
              heat (via hot water in the floor) in 1947 in San Marcos, Pat was
              an innovator early on. The firm would also establish the first
              pre-fabricated plywood wall and roof panel systems used in several
              schools to meet the economics of rapid construction (in 1948).
              C.J. Paderewski also secured many accolades for the first exterior
              all-glass elevator on the El Cortez Hotel (1956) and a forward-thinking
              Buckminster Fuller-esque geodesic dome on the Palomar College campus.
In his 1957 FAIA
              sponsorship application, the San Diego Chapter of the AIA (at the
              time led by Chapter President Sim Bruce Richards) noted
            "It is his philosophy that an architect can, and should, contribute
            of himself at every possible opportunity, that his community may
            be a better place in which to live for himself and his neighbor.
            He is stron in the belief that good architecture provides the environment
            for children and adults which will result in an enlightened generation.
            He also believes that it is the architect's mission to preach the
            gospel of good architecture at every opportunity in order that an
            ever increasing percentage of our people will appreciate and demand
            good architecture."
Over the years the firm employed Fred Livingstone,
            Fred Chilcott, Rich Albrecht, Olaf Oxford, Ed Pinoni, Ed Malone,
            Bob Jones, Walt Nelson, Bob Myrdal, George Markle, Don Innis, Dave
            Tennebaum, Art Hoelck, Delmar Mitchell, Louis Dean, Frank Stevenson,
            Luciano Zeccchin, Matt Plagwitz, Jack Madison, Don Goldman, Dan Perkins,
            Jack Carpenter, Bill Caldwell and many others.
