A comprehensive cloud-based DDoS protection solution that requires no additional hardware or software!



What is DDoS Attack?


Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are increasingly common and pose a serious threat to online businesses every day. A DDoS attack is an attempt to make a targeted machine or network resource inaccessible to its users. In such attacks, a variety of strategies and tactics are used to indefinitely interrupt the services of a host that is connected to the Internet.





The motivation and goals behind DDoS attacks vary and include extortion, revenge, diversion, business competition, personal rivalry and politics. Generally difficult to prevent, DDoS attacks can quickly overwhelm and incapacitate their targets.



How DDoS attacks can adversely affect businesses 


DDoS attacks have evolved in recent years to become a serious cyber threat. In fact, almost all organisations with an online presence today are at risk of being targeted. Here are some examples of the effects and consequences of a DDoS attack.



WHAT OUR CLIENTS SAY

We have been a client of REDtone for nine years and find their level of service exceptional. Three months ago, we were introduced to the REDtone DDoS Protection solution and we are very happy with its capabilities. DDoS attacks pose a serious threat to businesses today, especially those with an e-commerce platform, as they can cause downtime, revenue loss and even brand damage.

REDtone DDoS Protection offers a full report on attack statistics, behavioural trends, attack type and much more. Now, we can identify the traffic source and what the attackers were doing. It helps us mitigate both app-based and volumetric attacks so that uptime is guaranteed and legitimate traffic can still access our content.

In addition to the peace of mind that comes from knowing our website is well protected, we have also seen a marked improvement in site speed. Indeed, REDtone DDoS Protection is like the best insurance policy we can get for our online resources, and we will gladly recommend it to anyone.SL Tong - TOMEI
