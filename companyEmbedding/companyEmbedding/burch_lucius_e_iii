Early life[edit]
Burch was born near Nashville, Tennessee, in 1912. His father, Dr. Lucius E. Burch, was the Dean of Vanderbilt University Medical School, and his mother was the former Sarah ("Sadie") Polk Cooper. The family's ancestry included U.S. presidents Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk, Nashville founder John Donelson, and Episcopal bishop and Confederate Army general Leonidas Polk.[2] Burch spent much of his childhood at Riverwood, a Nashville mansion that belonged to his mother's family.[3] He attended the Peabody Demonstration School (now University School of Nashville), graduating in 1930.[4] After completing his undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University, Burch enrolled at Vanderbilt University Law School, obtaining his law degree in 1936.
Career[edit]
Burch joined the Memphis law firm of Burch, Minor and McKay, headed at the time by an uncle, Charles N. Burch. The firm's three senior partners died within the next few years and Burch inherited the firm's leadership. Together with new partners Jesse Johnson and John Porter, Burch was to lead the firm, now named Burch, Porter, and Johnson, for some fifty years.[2][5]
Burch became one of the most active trial lawyers of his era, participating in many well-known trials. He was active in political affairs, opposing the Memphis political machine of E. H. Crump and supporting the civil rights movement. In 1968, he worked on behalf of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a successful effort to lift a U.S. District Court injunction against a planned march in support of the striking workers in the Memphis Sanitation Strike.[2][6]
Burch was a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and the American Bar Foundation. He served as Chairman of the Tennessee Game and Fish Commission, president of the Tennessee Conservation League, and a member of the Tennessee Democratic Executive Committee. A life member of the NAACP, he was also a founder, charter member, and president of the Memphis Community Relations Council.[2]
Writings[edit]
Burch wrote articles on diverse topics, ranging from hunting and fishing to civic affairs and politics.[2] In 2003, a book of Burch's collected writings was published under the title Lucius: Writings of Lucius Burch.[7] In 2007, Memphis Magazine named the book as one of "32 exceptional examples of literature by Memphians, about Memphis, or set in the city," saying of the book, "In the absence of a biography, this collection of his letters offers a glimpse into the mind and manners of this remarkable gentleman."[1]
Philanthropy[edit]
An avid outdoorsman and an amateur pilot, Burch traveled widely to engage in hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, and scuba-diving. As a young man, he worked in Alaska for the U.S. Biological Survey and the Territory of Alaska, shooting bald eagles, which were considered a nuisance. In later years, he was to become a strong supporter of wildlife conservation.[2][8]
Late in his life, Burch was a leader of efforts to save the Shelby Farms area of Shelby County from development, a conservation initiative that culminated in the establishment of the Shelby Farms Park on 6,000 acres (2,400 ha). The Lucius E. Burch State Natural Area, a 728-acre (295 ha) state natural area within Shelby Farms Park, is now named in his honor.[9][10] Among the awards that he received were the Carter Patten Award of the Tennessee Conservation League, the "Lawyer's Lawyer" Award of the Memphis and Shelby County Bar Association, the Certificate of Merit of the Memphis Urban League, an honorary doctorate from Rhodes College, and honorary life membership in the Tennessee Academy of Sciences.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Burch married Elsie Caldwell in 1935. The couple were the parents of four daughters.[2] They resided in Collierville, Tennessee, and also maintained a summer cottage at Beersheba Springs that had belonged to Lucius' parents.[11][12]
His daughter, the late Lucia Burch, was the longtime lover, muse and collaborator of the photographer William Eggleston.[citation needed]
In the late 1990s, after her husband's death, Elsie Caldwell Burch donated $575,000 toward the construction of a new public library in Collierville. The library, completed in 2000, is named the Lucius E. Burch, Jr. and Mrs. Elsie C. Burch Library in honor of the Burch donation.[11][13]

Philanthropy[edit]
An avid outdoorsman and an amateur pilot, Burch traveled widely to engage in hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, and scuba-diving. As a young man, he worked in Alaska for the U.S. Biological Survey and the Territory of Alaska, shooting bald eagles, which were considered a nuisance.

Early life[edit]
Burch was born near Nashville, Tennessee, in 1912. His father, Dr. Lucius E. Burch, was the Dean of Vanderbilt University Medical School, and his mother was the former Sarah ("Sadie") Polk Cooper. The family's ancestry included U.S. presidents Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk, Nashville founder John Donelson, and Episcopal bishop and Confederate Army general Leonidas Polk.[2] Burch spent much of his childhood at Riverwood, a Nashville mansion that belonged to his mother's family.[3] He attended the Peabody Demonstration School (now University School of Nashville), graduating in 1930.[4] After completing his undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University, Burch enrolled at Vanderbilt University Law School, obtaining his law degree in 1936.
Career[edit]
Burch joined the Memphis law firm of Burch, Minor and McKay, headed at the time by an uncle, Charles N. Burch. The firm's three senior partners died within the next few years and Burch inherited the firm's leadership. Together with new partners Jesse Johnson and John Porter, Burch was to lead the firm, now named Burch, Porter, and Johnson, for some fifty years.[2][5]
Burch became one of the most active trial lawyers of his era, participating in many well-known trials. He was active in political affairs, opposing the Memphis political machine of E. H. Crump and supporting the civil rights movement. In 1968, he worked on behalf of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a successful effort to lift a U.S. District Court injunction against a planned march in support of the striking workers in the Memphis Sanitation Strike.[2][6]
Burch was a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and the American Bar Foundation. He served as Chairman of the Tennessee Game and Fish Commission, president of the Tennessee Conservation League, and a member of the Tennessee Democratic Executive Committee. A life member of the NAACP, he was also a founder, charter member, and president of the Memphis Community Relations Council.[2]
Writings[edit]
Burch wrote articles on diverse topics, ranging from hunting and fishing to civic affairs and politics.[2] In 2003, a book of Burch's collected writings was published under the title Lucius: Writings of Lucius Burch.[7] In 2007, Memphis Magazine named the book as one of "32 exceptional examples of literature by Memphians, about Memphis, or set in the city," saying of the book, "In the absence of a biography, this collection of his letters offers a glimpse into the mind and manners of this remarkable gentleman."[1]
Philanthropy[edit]
An avid outdoorsman and an amateur pilot, Burch traveled widely to engage in hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, and scuba-diving. As a young man, he worked in Alaska for the U.S. Biological Survey and the Territory of Alaska, shooting bald eagles, which were considered a nuisance. In later years, he was to become a strong supporter of wildlife conservation.[2][8]
Late in his life, Burch was a leader of efforts to save the Shelby Farms area of Shelby County from development, a conservation initiative that culminated in the establishment of the Shelby Farms Park on 6,000 acres (2,400 ha). The Lucius E. Burch State Natural Area, a 728-acre (295 ha) state natural area within Shelby Farms Park, is now named in his honor.[9][10] Among the awards that he received were the Carter Patten Award of the Tennessee Conservation League, the "Lawyer's Lawyer" Award of the Memphis and Shelby County Bar Association, the Certificate of Merit of the Memphis Urban League, an honorary doctorate from Rhodes College, and honorary life membership in the Tennessee Academy of Sciences.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Burch married Elsie Caldwell in 1935. The couple were the parents of four daughters.[2] They resided in Collierville, Tennessee, and also maintained a summer cottage at Beersheba Springs that had belonged to Lucius' parents.[11][12]
His daughter, the late Lucia Burch, was the longtime lover, muse and collaborator of the photographer William Eggleston.[citation needed]
In the late 1990s, after her husband's death, Elsie Caldwell Burch donated $575,000 toward the construction of a new public library in Collierville. The library, completed in 2000, is named the Lucius E. Burch, Jr. and Mrs. Elsie C. Burch Library in honor of the Burch donation.[11][13]

Game description







His childish innocence wasn’t meant to last long, oh no... When little Lucius was born on the meaningful date of June 6th, 1966, nobody expected him to be anything other than a normal little boy. His childhood, spent in a luxurious manor was as normal as every kid’s young years - well, except for the extreme wealth of his parents, as Lucius grew up with everything he desired, including several maids, the family’s own butcher and a private teacher.
Everything changed, though, when Lucius turned 6. His real father, the Devil, appeared in his dreams the night before his birthday, revealing that Lucius was his son.
The Beast , through Lucius, managed to bring a descendant back to the earth - and so it is Lucius’ task now to accomplish the missions of the Devil and gain control over the world. But firstly, Lucius must get rid of all his family members and the service staff in the manor to be able to make their wealth and powers his.
Equipped with supernatural powers, Lucius starts off on a blood- flooding tour of horror through his house, using hell’s powers of telekinesis and mind control to orchestrate deadly accidents that will minimize the population of the manor one by one by one. However, this he must carry out without suspicion and so begins what looks like just an unfortunate set of accidents...

Key Features:

Unique 3D horror adventure gaming experience
Homage to the classics of the horror movie genre, including “The Omen”, “Shining”, “The Exorcist”
3D open world aventure gameplay
Cinematic Cut-scenes
Breathtaking atmosphere, stunning visuals
Supernatural powers, including Telekinesis and Mind Control

Good
smoterev

12/14/2016





                    It is a short game, but with a very dark story. Ones the storyline is finished it isnt really much fun anymore.
I would recommend to buy it in sale, if you really want to have it.

Puzzle
simodeso

                    It is a puzzle game, well something like that.
The objective of this puzzle game  is to kill in a very cruel way your "enemys" , even if they didn't nothing wrong.
It is funny to play, and it is a nice indie game that also has a sequel.

The Son Of The Devil
JessicaSherawat

11/27/2016





                    Game that is the replica of the cult movie "The Prophecy", but with its own plot and situations with consequences that will keep you stuck to culminate the story. I highly recommend it.

Not great, but enjoyable cheesy horror
piokielar

12/09/2015





                    Lucius is a cheesy horror game in style of classic B movies. It's similar to movie Omen, but not so serious. You?re a child who?s been possessed by the devil and given powers to murder people. It?s a pretty straight forward game with not much difficulty to it. All in all it's a decent game to play and has some funny and cool death scenes. It does have a slight challenge of trying to figure out what you need and how to kill your target. It?s all based in and around the house you live in. Controls are a little wonky but do their job. Luckily you are able to setup them on your own which makes game better. Only issues I had with it were movement on the bike you can get for Lucius to ride around on. Graphics aren?t bad, just look like something from few years back. The look on Lucius?s face is a little disturbing as is strongest thing graphics-wise. Overall it isn?t a bad game to play. It?s pretty straightforward and not very hard to complete and you can get most of the achievements from pretty much just playing through it. Still if you want some not-too-serious and not-too-scary horror game - give it a try!

Not really engaging
Dad477412

10/28/2015





                    First lets start where the game shines, it's atmosphere. It's dark, it creeps you out and at first you just want to keep playing. Then, after the first ten minutes, after your first kill, the game goes downhill very fast. I spent the next half hour doing some chores, like "cleaning the bedroom", which felt pointless and trying to figure out how to kill my next target. I failed. I have no clue what to do and have too much integrity to look for a walkthrough for the first actual level. The game fails to even point you in the right direction, so you are forced to start interacting with everything trying to accomplish anything. I like puzzles and even point & click games, but they tell you what you need, or at least a hint, here you have nothing and you will get bored really fast. Can't recommend it.
