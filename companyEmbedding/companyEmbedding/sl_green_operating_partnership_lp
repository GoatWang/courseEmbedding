(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview SL Green Realty Corp., which is referred to as SL Green or the Company, a Maryland corporation, and SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P., which is referred to as SLGOP or the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, were formed in June 1997 for the purpose of combining the commercial real estate business of S.L. Green Properties, Inc. and its affiliated partnerships and entities. The Company is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, with in-house capabilities in property management, acquisitions, financing, development, construction and leasing. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to "we," "our" and "us" means the Company and all entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership. Reckson Associates Realty Corp., or Reckson, and Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P. or ROP, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The following discussion related to our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The New York City commercial real estate market continued to strengthen in 2013, and we took advantage of this strengthening market in improving occupancies and deploying capital in the borough of Manhattan to strategically position the Company for future growth. Leasing and Operating We have historically outperformed the Manhattan office market, and did so again in 2013. Our Manhattan office property occupancy on same-store properties based on leases signed increased to 96.6% from 95.1% in the prior year. During 2013, we signed office leases in Manhattan encompassing 5.2 million square feet, of which 4.3 million square feet represented office leases that replaced previously occupied space. Our mark-to-market on these 4.3 million square feet of signed Manhattan office leases that replaced previously occupied space was 9.5% for 2013. The highlight of our leasing activity during 2013 was the signing of an agreement extending Citigroup's triple-net lease covering 2,634,670 square feet at 388-390 Greenwich Street through December 31, 2035. The agreement includes an option for Citigroup to acquire the properties during the period from December 1, 2017 through December 31, 2020 for $2.0 billion. The mark-to-market based on Citigroup's cash rent in the extension period is 12.8 percent. New leasing activity in Manhattan in 2013 totaled 25.7 million square feet, slightly below the ten-year average but higher than 2012. Of the total 2013 leasing activity in Manhattan, the Midtown submarket accounted for approximately 16.0 million square feet, or 62.3%. Midtown's overall office vacancy increased from 10.3% at December 31, 2012 to 11.2% at December 31, 2013. However, 1.2 million square feet of new office space was added to the Midtown office inventory, with approximately 2.2 million square feet (0.6% of the total 395.3 million square foot Manhattan office inventory) currently under construction and scheduled to be placed in service by 2015 or early 2016. Demand for space in certain sub-markets such as Midtown South and a lack of new supply created conditions in which asking rents for direct space in Midtown South increased during 2013 by 27.3% to $63.67 per square foot. Asking rents for direct space in Midtown increased during 2013 by 2.6% to $70.54 per square foot and have increased by 10.5% since the recessionary trough in in the first quarter of 2010. Over the same period, net effective rents (which take into consideration leasing concessions) have increased by 21.5%. Acquisition and Disposition Activity Sales volume in Manhattan in 2013 increased 5.3% to $30.0 billion compared to $28.5 billion in 2012, partly as a result of a flurry of activity in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, consistent with our multi-faceted approach to property acquisitions, we were able to source transactions that provide value enhancement opportunities, including the acquisition of equity interests in six office, retail and multi-family properties during 2013, representing total investments of $0.7 billion. We also took advantage of the improving market conditions and interest by institutions and individuals seeking ownership interests in properties to sell assets, disposing of properties with more limited growth opportunities, and raising efficiently priced capital for reinvestment. During the year, we sold our fee interest in 333 West 34th Street, New York, New York, 300 Main Street, Stamford, Connecticut, and 44 West 55th Street, New York, New York, . Debt and Preferred Equity Beginning in 2010, we saw an increase in opportunities to acquire existing debt and preferred equity positions in high quality Manhattan office properties at discounts that enabled us to generate high risk adjusted yields, and offer off-market access to property acquisitions. As 2013 progressed, and the availability of acquiring discounted debt and preferred equity in high quality properties waned, we began to focus on the origination of financings, typically in the form of preferred equity and mezzanine  Table of Contents  debt, for owners or acquirers seeking higher leverage than was available from traditional lending sources lending at modest leverage levels. Traditional sources of junior financings have not yet materialized. This provided us with an opportunity to fill a need for additional debt by providing more modest amounts of leverage. The typical investments made by us during 2013 were to reputable owners or acquirers, and at leverage levels which are senior to sizable equity investments by the sponsors. During 2013, our debt and preferred equity activities included purchases and originations, inclusive of accretion of reserves, previous discounts and pay-in-kind interest, of approximately $601.3 million, and sales, redemption and participations of approximately $644.9 million.   Directly acquiring four buildings for an aggregate gross purchase price of $533.0 million encompassing 0.6 million square feet. Investing in two properties through joint ventures at implied gross valuations of $151.1 million and encompassing 0.4 million square feet. Issuing 2.6 million shares of SL Green's common stock raising net proceeds of $248.9 million. Redeeming all 7.7 million outstanding shares of 7.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. Closing on a $300.0 million refinancing of the Company's MRA facility which replaced the former $175.0 million facility. Closing on a $900.0 million mortgage refinancing which replaced the former $775.0 million mortgage.   Closing on two mortgages totaling approximately $297.0 million.   Signing 233 office leases totaling 5.2 million square feet in Manhattan.   Signing 143 office leases totaling 0.9 million square feet in our Suburban properties.  As of December 31, 2013, we owned the following interests in commercial office buildings in the New York Metropolitan area, primarily in midtown Manhattan. Our investments in the New York Metropolitan area also include investments in Brooklyn, Long Island, Westchester County, Connecticut and Northern New Jersey, which are collectively known as the Suburban properties:   Weighted Number of Average Location Ownership Buildings Square Feet Occupancy(1) Manhattan Consolidated properties 23 17,306,045 94.5 % Unconsolidated properties 9 5,934,434 96.6 % Suburban Consolidated properties 26 4,087,400 79.8 % Unconsolidated properties 4 1,222,100 87.2 % 62 28,549,979 92.5 %  As of December 31, 2013, we also owned investments in 16 retail properties encompassing approximately 875,800 square feet, 20 development buildings encompassing approximately 3,230,800 square feet, four residential buildings encompassing 801 units (approximately 719,900 square feet), two land interests encompassing approximately 961,400 square feet. The Company also has ownership interests in 28 west coast properties encompassing 52 buildings totaling approximately 3,654,300 square feet. In addition, we manage two office buildings owned by third parties and affiliated companies encompassing approximately 626,400 square feet. As of December 31, 2013, we also held debt and preferred equity investments with a book value of $1.3 billion.  Critical Accounting Policies  Table of Contents  judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investment in Commercial Real Estate Properties On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges for consolidated properties) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the calculated fair value of the property. We do not believe that the values of any of our consolidated properties were impaired at December 31, 2013. We also evaluate our real estate properties for potential impairment when a real estate property has been classified as held for sale. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. In June 2013, we recorded a $2.2 million impairment charge in connection with the sale of 300 Main Street in Stamford, Connecticut. A variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of our properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and building under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portions substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portions under construction.  Table of Contents  to a clawback feature. Distributions we receive from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in excess of our basis in the investment are recorded as offsets to our investment balance if we remain liable for future obligations of the joint venture or may otherwise be committed to provide future additional financial support.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
