ABOUT US
The Group


Reliance Trust was founded on the belief that an independent, professional and client oriented company is best placed to serve a demanding international clientele. Reliance Trust is management owned and not affiliated with any financial institution, bank, P/E investor, or law firm, and therefore avoids the conflicts of interest common to so many other fiduciaries. Reliance Trust has our personal and long term commitment to provide the security that our clients count on. Our clients have the ability to select their own professional legal, tax and financial advisors, but we can also arrange introductions to leading experts in many countries. Our procedure and compliance principles exceed industry standards, and respect all regulatory obligations.
Reliance Trust was founded by Annemarie de Wit, a legal and tax adviser in Geneva, Switzerland. She has assembled a team of professionals with experience at leading international service providers in Switzerland, a.o Daniel Hollowell a senior trust professional with more than 20 years experience and Herman Krul, who founded ATC (Switzerland) Sàrl in 2003, together with the ATC group, and who succeeded to develop a high quality fiduciary business in Switzerland.


Our team brings together legal and tax expertise with the diverse skills of the experienced trust and company administration professionals. Our mission is to deliver the highest standards of work and a strong focus on a customer-oriented, legal and tax compliant approach. We look forward to serving your trust and company administration needs for years to come.
Our administrative offices are located in Switzerland and Luxembourg. We have cooperative relationships with an extensive network of international service providers.
Reliance Trust is supervised by the highest authority in Switzerland, the FINMA, as a DSFI under the Anti-Money Laundering Act and is a Member of the Swiss Association of Trust Companies (SATC).


Philosophy


To achieve the highest standards of work in today’s fast changing world, it is essential for a trust company to focus on its core competencies. As such, Reliance Trust specialises in the field of corporate and private client fiduciary services. We believe that it is not in our client’s interest to offer secondary services such as asset management, auditing, etc.
We feel that it is our duty to preserve our clients’reputation, as much as that of our own company and our intermediaries.


To achieve this we adhere to a professional and compliant approach to business. Confidentiality of our clients and their families, and protection of their assets are one of the priorities of our team.
At the same time, it is important that our clients are able to establish a long term relationship with our employees. Our team aspires to be your partner of choice.


Clients


Reliance Trust serves a sophisticated international clientele of corporate and private clients.


Our corporate clients include large and small multi-national companies with activities across a variety of sectors and geographies.

OFFICES
Reliance Trust has offices in Switzerland and Luxembourg. To address the specific needs of our international clients, each office is led by experts who have a specific understanding, technical knowledge, cultural background and professional network in the country.


Why Switzerland?

Switzerland is known for its political stability, independence, dedication to the preservation of confidentiality, and the provision of a broad range of financial services.
Switzerland is not a tax-haven, but a respected on-shore jurisdiction, and on no black lists.
Switzerland has been able to develop a highly professional, multi-lingual workforce that is trained to work with famous Swiss precision and efficiency.

Using a Swiss Trustee

In 2007, Switzerland ratified The Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and Their Recognition.
In 2008, the Swiss federal tax authorities issued the Circular no. 20, laying down the principles applicable to trusts that hold assets for resident and non-resident clients and are administered in Switzerland.The Circular clearly confirms that there are no negative tax consequences to non-resident clients engaging a Swiss trustee.
Reliance Trust – a Swiss based trust company – may administer trusts that are governed by the laws of other jurisdictions.



Why Luxembourg?

Like Switzerland, Luxembourg is one of the largest global financial centers. It is a stable and multicultural state with a solid financial infrastructure.
The country is a member of the European Union and of leading international economic organisations such as the OECD.
Luxembourg is the Eurozone’s leading private-banking market, with more than 140 private banks. Thanks to the support of these private banks, reputable law/tax firms and quality fiduciary, trust and corporate services companies, the country offers a broad range of financial services and attracts large international clients.
The country currently implements the MiFID II package. The objective is to make their financial markets even more efficient, resilient and transparent and to further improve investor protection.
Luxembourg has flexible and attractive legal, regulatory and tax regimes. The extensive double tax treaties and bilateral investment treaties are generally based on the OECD model convention. This gives assurance on their interpretation and makes the country highly attractive (compared to offshore jurisdictions), particularly for the structuring of complex international transactions.
The country is an international niche leader, notable in fund distribution, being the world second largest center for funds after the US. It has also a leading position in Financial Technologies ‘FinTech’.















SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Reliance Trust has a business practice that involves participating in initiatives that benefit society:

The Group is committed to the continued training of its employees and finds it important that they (together with their families) enjoy a good quality of life. To do so, the company actively contributes to cultural and sport activities.
To benefit society on a larger scale and contribute to global economic and social development, Reliance Trust has created its own “Charitable Trust” under the laws of England and a “Social Responsibility Committee”. Reliance Trust and the Reliance Charitable Trust financially support amongst others the following charities:

 

Médecins Sans Frontières
Fondation Théodora
Action Innocence
APOPO Foundation
www.msf.ch
www.theodora.org
www.actioninnocence.org
www.apopo.org

















NEWS
Our team is on top of international developments and on reporting obligations (FATCA/CRS). This enables us to provide tailor made and innovative solutions that are in line with international regulations and makes Reliance Trust a leader in the field of trust, fiduciary and corporate services.

Out with the old and in with the new it seems, but maintaining expertise in much needed areas. The Co workers were never an issue as you can read in previous reviews however mgmt was. Now that a lot of people have moved on the new mgmt seems to understand what kind of boat were all in. It's not the best place to work, but it's come a long way from when I started here. It's a good place to build a resume in the investment mgmt industry.ConsPay is on the lowest end of the industry. I believe McDonald's may soon pay more.Advice to ManagementWork with the other departments and cover for your people.

Everyone's out for themselves, so watch your back.Advice to ManagementStop being so petty!! Don't talk about other departments and project your personal bias onto your subordinates. When you pit departments against each other, you create an awful environment for your employees because nobody wants to help ANYONE else. Also, when you hire young, ambitious people straight out of college - they're not just gonna sit back and coast with the same job for six years doing mediocre work. They want to learn more, do more, and be appreciated. And unless you can give them a career path, they're gone.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Reliance Trust Company Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reliance Trust Company 2015-08-09 05:46 PDT Jun 5, 2015"Great Start"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Atlanta, GACurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Atlanta, GARecommendsPositive OutlookNo opinion of CEOProsGreat place to work as a recent graduate.ConsNot a lot of room for growthAdvice to ManagementBe more personal.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Reliance Trust Company Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reliance Trust Company 2015-06-05 22:51 PDT Apr 2, 2015 Helpful (3)"Changes with FIS not going well"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Manager in Atlanta, GACurrent Employee - Manager in Atlanta, GADoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookI have been working at Reliance Trust Company full-time (More than 5 years)ProsPromotions are easy to get and frequent if the right people like you.

It's a small enough firm that you don't disappear, but has a larger company feel. Senior management has made great strides in improving the profitability of the company and is beginning to pass that on to the employees. With regard to the working environment, the location is great, parking is free, and the building has a lot of amenities.ConsThere is still a bit of a disconnect between Executive Management and the associates, but, in all fairness, it is improving.Advice to ManagementThe improvements in morale and employee attitude are beginning to show.
