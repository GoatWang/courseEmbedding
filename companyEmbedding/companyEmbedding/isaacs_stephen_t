OncoLogics, Inc. Appoints Stephen T. Isaacs as President and Chief Executive Officer  











Tweet








3/7/2007 10:13:19 AM


BERKELEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oncologic, Inc. today announced that Stephen Isaacs has joined the company as President and CEO. Mr. Isaacs, 58, is also a director of the company, a position he has held for the past 9 months. Mr. Isaacs succeeds Roy K. Skogstrom, 51, who will become a consultant to the company and will remain as a director.

Prior to joining Oncologic, Mr. Isaacs founded Cerus Corporation (NASD:CERS - News), and then served over 14 years as its President and CEO. Cerus is a biotechnology company focused on the development of products for the decontamination of blood components, and oncology applications. During this period, Cerus grew from approximately 10 employees to over 200. While at Cerus, Mr. Isaacs was responsible for running the company, managing the company's growth, and raising money to keep the project development programs on track. He led the company's IPO in 1997 and managed a number of secondary financings. Mr. Isaacs also drove numerous licensing and partnership deals, including successfully negotiating agreements with Baxter Corporation (Intercept Blood Systems), the Consortium for Plasma Science, Kirin Brewery (cancer therapy), and MedImmune Corporation (cancer vaccines). Cerus now has two licensed products in Europe. Under Mr. Isaacs, Cerus raised approximately $250 million from public and private placements, including contributions from various partnerships.

At Oncologic, Mr. Isaacs will be responsible for daily management, strategic planning, fundraising, and investor relations. In addition, he will coordinate technology and product development, and strategic technology placement. Mr. Isaacs joins a very experienced scientific team lead by Dr. Paul Chinn (Chief Scientific Officer) and Dr. Gary Braslawsky (Senior Vice-President and Director of Pre-clinical Development), both formerly of Biogen Idec (NASD:BIIB - News), where they were part of the senior scientific team responsible for the successful development and clinical approval of the anti-cancer drug Zevalin®.

"Mr. Isaacs is a tremendous addition to the company," said Oncologic Chairman Winston Salser, Ph.D., founding President of Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology company (NASD:AMGN - News). "Steve's strong experience in managing growth, public and private fundraising, and commercializing a successful product give Oncologic a management team capable of maximizing the potential of the company's opportunity."

Salser continued, "Outgoing president and CEO Roy Skogstrom will report to Mr. Isaacs and will be in charge of special assignments as a consultant. Roy has led the company since its inception and has done an outstanding job. We are thrilled to have both Steve and Roy as part of Oncologic."

Mr. Isaacs stated, "I look forward to working with my new colleagues and establishing collaborative partnerships to enable Oncologic to achieve its full potential in both its core cancer technology and other strategic areas. My 14 years at Cerus will be valuable in guiding the company forward, and I'm pleased to be working at a company co-founded by Professor Henry Rapoport, who was also a member of the founding team of Cerus. I'm looking forward to the challenge of making Oncologic a successful biotechnology company."

Mr. Isaacs holds a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from U.C. Berkeley, and has authored 20 scientific publications and 42 U.S. patents.

About Oncologic, Inc.

Oncologic, Inc. is a privately held biotechnology company headquartered in Berkeley, California. The company was founded by the late Drs. Sam Rose and Henry Rapoport to pioneer their highly innovative technology platform for the treatment of cancer.

BERKELEY, Calif., Sept.  26, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aduro Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq:ADRO) today announced that Stephen T. Isaacs, the company’s chairman, president and CEO, will receive the Berkeley Chamber of Commerce Visionary Award. One of three recipients for 2016, Mr. Isaacs was recognized for his commitment to innovation and his visionary leadership within the city of Berkeley. A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ab2a14fb-8573-416b-989e-484f04910ffb “Steve is a consummate innovator and incredible leader,” said G. Steven Martin, Ph.D., former dean of Biological Sciences at the University of California in Berkeley. “He is one of few in the industry with the foresight to begin advancing research in immuno-oncology over a decade ago. Additionally, his visionary leadership has forged deep ties between biotech and academia, as well as between the city of Berkeley and countries around the world. A prime example of this is Aduro’s research collaboration with U.C. Berkeley through their Immunotherapeutics and Vaccine Research Initiative (IVRI), with the aim of accelerating breakthrough discoveries and making an impact on global health. For his many accomplishments and admirable character, I extend my sincerest congratulations to Steve for this well-deserved award.”     The Berkeley Chamber of Commerce created the Visionary Awards to celebrate people with imagination and persistence to innovate in the City of Berkeley. Long known as a city on the vanguard of public policy and social activism, Berkeley is growing its reputation as a place for world-leading companies. These enterprises represent the latest generation of Berkeleyans working to change the world. Their visions are key to the vitality of Berkeley and the greater Bay Area. With the unique attributes of UC Berkeley, the Berkeley Lab, and the dynamic community, entrepreneurs are choosing Berkeley as the place to launch their ventures. Their companies are striving to meet the challenges of the next generation, while at the same time, creating jobs in the city. The Chamber has partnered with the City of Berkeley, the University of California, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab to showcase these leaders. “We created the Visionary awards to recognize people who are truly making a difference – for our local workforce, for the community and, especially in the case of Steve and Aduro, for people suffering from devastating diseases,” commented Kirsten MacDonald, co-chief executive officer of the Berkeley Chamber of Commerce. “We applaud Steve for his persistence in approaching the challenging field of drug development with unique and innovative approaches, for building a thriving biotechnology company, and for identifying revolutionary ways to bring academia and industry together for the benefit of patients not only locally, but also in the developing world.” “It is a tremendous honor to be recognized by the Chamber of Commerce for innovation in this city, which is known for its revolutionary thinking,” said Stephen T. Isaacs, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Aduro. “For over a decade, we have been in Berkeley working to bring new immunotherapies to patients to transform the treatment of cancer and other challenging diseases. We look forward to our continued commitment to advance immunotherapy – for the benefit of patients, employees and the community.” About Aduro Aduro Biotech, Inc. is an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases. Aduro's technology platforms, which are designed to harness the body's natural immune system, are being investigated in cancer indications and have the potential to expand into autoimmune and infectious diseases.
