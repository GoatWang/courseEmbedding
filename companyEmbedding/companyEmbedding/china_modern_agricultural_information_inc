China Modern Agricultural Information Is A Cash Cow - China Modern Agricultural Information Inc. (OTCMKTS:CMCI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»China Modern Agricultural Information Is A Cash CowNov.20.14 | About: China Modern (CMCI) 10K Nerd Deep Value, contrarian, long-term horizon, growth at reasonable priceSummaryThis article is an update to an article I wrote on CMCI in June.CMCI is an extremely undervalued and underfollowed company.Since my initial article, CMCI has produced record results.CMCI has accumulated a large amount of cash that, when reinvested in the business, will materially improve their already impressive results.I previously wrote an article about China Modern Agricultural Information (OTCQB:CMCI) back in June. In that article, I argued that CMCI was massively undervalued.
Since that article, CMCI has released two additional quarters of record results. A few highlights from the last two quarters include:

CMCI produced record cash flow in the quarter ended June and record revenue and income in the quarter ended September.
In each of the last two quarters, CMCI produced over $10M in cash flow. Before the last two quarters, CMCI never produced $10M in cash flow.
Shareholder equity passed the $100M mark in September.
In each of the last two quarters, revenues are up over 20% YoY.
Cash balances doubled from the prior year, ending the most recent quarter at $67M.

Source: My calculations; CMCI filings.
In the following article, I discuss the most recent results. For a more comprehensive review of the company, please see my prior article.
Business and Industry
CMCI is in the business of producing and selling milk in China. The business is split along three lines, two of which are material. The two material lines are milk sales and commissions from helping farmers sell milk to dairies. Of these two lines, the milk sales division is the much larger division and is the driver of growth.
CMCI's milk sales division owns cows and sells the milk produced by their cows to dairies in China. The unique aspect of their operation is that most of their cows are cared for by independent farmers. CMCI enters into fixed-price contracts with these farmers to care for the cows. CMCI also enters into fixed-price contracts with dairies to purchase the milk. CMCI then earns the spread on these two contracts. This spread is quite significant.

The market for dairy products in China has increased exponentially in the last few years and is projected to continue increasing for the foreseeable future. The major trends driving this growth are increased urbanization and incomes as wealthier, urban Chinese drink substantially more milk than rural, poorer Chinese. These trends are expected to continue for many years.
Financial Update
CMCI has steadily increased book value per share. From mid-2011 to September 2014, they have increased book value by 250%, from $0.56 to $1.96.
Also, since 2011, and even more significantly over the last year, CMCI has accumulated a ridiculous amount of cash. Out of the $1.96 in book value, $1.26 is in cash. CMCI can deploy this cash in a few different ways. They could initiate a dividend, buy back shares or reinvest in their business. Given their recent actions, I expect them to use this cash to expand their current operations.
In the past, CMCI has used excess cash to make major purchases to grow their business. For example, in 2011 CMCI acquired Yulong Cattle and in 2013 CMCI acquired significant land leases that are now used in the business. I expect CMCI to use the cash to significantly expand their business in the near future. When they reinvest this cash in their business, they could, quite literally, double their operations overnight.

Source: My calculations; CMCI filings.
CMCI has continued to grow earnings and cash flow over the last two quarters. The major difference between earnings and cash flow is that earnings include a charge for deferred taxes. These deferred taxes are not paid and not anticipated to be paid. Cash flow is therefore a better metric for valuing CMCI.
Note that the deferred taxes also decrease book value since the deferred taxes are carried as a liability on the balance sheet. The book value I used above includes deferred taxes as a liability and therefore understates the true book value.


Source: My calculations; CMCI filings.
Revenue has continued to grow at an impressive clip quarter over quarter. Over the last twelve months, revenues are up 24%. Milk sales now make up over 80% of CMCI's revenue and are growing at above 30%. They have been able to grow revenues at these levels while still accumulating a large amount of cash. Revenue growth should accelerate when they reinvest their cash in the business. Even without this catalyst, 20+% growth will suffice.

Source: My calculations; CMCI filings.
As I've mentioned, CMCI has accumulated a lot of cash. At this point, cash represents 58% of their book value. While this is a positive development, it has also reduced returns on capital (ROE is now approaching 30%). As you can see in the graph below, there is an obvious inverse relationship between the cash on hand and CMCI's ROE.
When CMCI reinvests their cash, ROE should jump.

Source: My calculations; CMCI filings.
As you can see in the chart below, share price and volume have both increased over the last few quarters. However, there is still a long way to go before there is a liquid market for CMCI. This illiquidity is part of the reason for the low price. The other reasons, I believe, are the China small cap discount and the lack of company communications beyond SEC filings.



Valuation
CMCI:

Has a book value of $1.96.
Produces over $10M per quarter in cash (or over $.75 per share per year).
Produced over $27M in earnings over the last twelve months (or over $0.50 per share per year).

How much would you pay for a business with a book value of almost $2, cash of $1.27, producing $0.75 in cash flow and growing at over 20%? Surely, the answer is more than $0.65...

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Buyer's Feedback


Easy Sourcing helps me trade easily!
As a new member to Made-in-China.com, I posted my first request on Easy Sourcing one month ago. Fortunately, I received the first quality quotation from supplier - Changzhou Ji****Co., Ltd. within 2 hours after submission! Finally I ordered Electronic Transformer from the supplier. In the past I had to spend several days to find a satisfied supplier. Now, I only need a few hours!

I have found several qualified suppliers through Easy Sourcing!
I have been a premium buyer with Made-in-China.com for many years. Since the first time posting sourcing request on Easy Sourcing, I have found several reliable suppliers, it's convenient for me to receive rapid quotations and compare the suppliers. Easy Sourcing has provided tremendous value to me. Now it's my favorite way to find Chinese suppliers.
