HOUSTON, Jan. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE:   CNP) announced today that the board of directors approved the appointment of William (Bill) D. Rogers, 54, as executive vice president of finance and accounting, effective Feb. 9. He will succeed Gary L. Whitlock as executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective March 3. 
"With more than 40 years of corporate financial experience, Gary joined the company when we became a stand-alone company in 2001 and played a key role in developing and executing our finance and business strategies," said Scott M. Prochazka, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. "He was instrumental in leading the divesture of non-core assets, the monetization of the company's generation assets, restructuring the company's balance sheet and creating Enable Midstream Partners. We are grateful for his leadership, commitment and contributions to the company, and we wish him all the best."
Whitlock will continue to report to Prochazka as a special advisor and will help ensure a smooth transition process until he retires later this year. He will also remain on the board of Enable Midstream Partners.
"We are excited to have Bill join our company and senior leadership team," added Prochazka. "With his vast knowledge of the utility industry, prior capital markets experience and proven financial expertise, Bill is an ideal fit for our executive team."

Three years later, he was named finance director for Dow in the United Kingdom and Ireland, where he was also responsible for Information Systems. Whitlock returned to the U.S. in 1990 to lead financial reporting and analysis for Dow U.S and five years later, was named vice president and North American Controller and was a member of the Dow North American Operating Board.
