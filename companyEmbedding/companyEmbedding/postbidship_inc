HOW IT
WORKS




Post.Bid.Ship. is a powerful addition to many transportation management systems (TMS). The industry has spoken decisively to declare that Post.Bid.Ship. is the best solution for pricing and coordinating your spot shipments hassle free. No more phone calls. No more haggling. Just peace of mind.




It’s Simple

 








Connect.




At the beginning of our relationship we’ll take you through a painless configuration. We’ll plug your TMS into the power of Post.Bid.Ship. As part of this process, we’ll make sure that Post.Bid.Ship. only considers the carriers you know and trust when auctioning your spot shipments.

 








Post.




You can easily send spot market shipments to Post.Bid.Ship. to be hosted in a reverse auction that your current service providers participate in. In a reverse auction, transparent bidding leads service providers to the current market price every time.

Bid.




The carriers you know and trust are already integrated with Post.Bid.Ship. When you send spot market shipments for bid, we automatically notify the approved service providers and invite them to bid. You determine how long the auction remains open.

 














Ship.




You can choose to automatically tender the shipment to the lowest bidder, or you can tender shipments after a manual review process. Post.Bid.Ship. supports the following award types:
 
Auto Award: The first trusted carrier to bid your target price will end the auction and the shipment will automatically be tendered to them through your TMS.
 
Auto Variance: If an auction ends without hitting your target price, Post.Bid.Ship. can award the shipment to the lowest bidding service provider within a variance that you select. If so, the shipment is automatically tendered to them through your TMS.
 
Manager Approval: If you don’t set a target price, or if no one bids within your preset variance, Post.Bid.Ship. can notify a manager to approve or reject the bids submitted by your trusted vendors.

 














That’s all there is to it! 
You get a competitive market price from a service provider you trust without the time and stress of haggling.

Post.Bid.Ship. – The Transportation Marketplace of the 21st Century



















































































 








































 





 




 

 





HOW IT
WORKS




Post.Bid.Ship. is a powerful addition to many transportation management systems (TMS). The industry has spoken decisively to declare that Post.Bid.Ship. is the best solution for pricing and coordinating your spot shipments hassle free. No more phone calls. No more haggling. Just peace of mind.




It’s Simple

 








Connect.




At the beginning of our relationship we’ll take you through a painless configuration. We’ll plug your TMS into the power of Post.Bid.Ship. As part of this process, we’ll make sure that Post.Bid.Ship. only considers the carriers you know and trust when auctioning your spot shipments.

 








Post.




You can easily send spot market shipments to Post.Bid.Ship. to be hosted in a reverse auction that your current service providers participate in. In a reverse auction, transparent bidding leads service providers to the current market price every time.

 








Post.




You can easily send spot market Shipments to Post.Bid.Ship. to be hosted in a reverse auction that only your current service providers participate in. In a reverse auction, transparent bidding leads service providers to the current market price every time.

 














Bid.




The carriers you know and trust are already integrated with Post.Bid.Ship. When you send spot market shipments for bid, we automatically notify the approved service providers and invite them to bid. You determine how long the auction remains open.

 














Ship.




You can choose to automatically tender the shipment to the lowest bidder, or you can tender shipments after a manual review process. Post.Bid.Ship. supports the following award types:
 
Auto Award: The first trusted carrier to bid your target price will end the auction and the shipment will automatically be tendered to them through your TMS.
 
Auto Variance: If an auction ends without hitting your target price, Post.Bid.Ship. can award the shipment to the lowest bidding service provider within a variance that you select. If so, the shipment is automatically tendered to them through your TMS.
 
Manager Approval: If you don’t set a target price, or if no one bids within your preset variance, Post.Bid.Ship. can notify a manager to approve or reject the bids submitted by your trusted vendors.

 














That’s all there is to it! 
You get a competitive market price from a service provider you trust without the time and stress of haggling.

About Us




Post.Bid.Ship. is an exciting technology company based in sunny Scottsdale, Arizona. From our origins as a business school project at the University of Arizona, Post.Bid.Ship. grew to become a venture backed company serving the enterprise shipper market. Our award-winning and Oracle Validated Integration was built by a team of dedicated entrepreneurs and technologists passionate about the transportation industry.

PostBidShip originated at The University of Arizona, where classmates Jarret Hamstreet, Cody Nicholls and Micky Thompson created the original venture concept during their graduate studies at the McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship.  After winning the University’s 2010 “Best Venture Grand Prize,” Hamstreet, Nicholls and Thompson launched PostBidShip following their graduation.  A two-time winner of the State of Arizona’s “Arizona Innovation Challenge,” PostBidShip became an online commercial freight marketplace serving over 11,000 users before evolving into an enterprise technology provider to Fortune 1000 companies.  In 2016, PostBidShip’s innovative spot market freight auction technology earned the highly coveted “Oracle Validated Integration” designation with its integration with Oracle Transportation Management (OTM).
