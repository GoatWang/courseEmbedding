Northlich Ownership Changes Hands but Stays Independent
CEO Serrianne Sells Cincinnati Shop to COO Selker


	By  

Jack Neff.
	

	
	
 Published on January 04, 2008. 







		        BATAVIA, Ohio (AdAge.com) -- Mark Serrianne, owner and CEO for the past decade of Cincinnati's Northlich, is stepping down and selling the agency to longtime Chief Operating Officer Kathy Selker.


		Mark Serrianne 
 	



Mr. Serrianne will remain as non-executive chairman, but has sold his entire stake to Ms. Selker, who joined Northlich in 2000 after a career in finance at Arthur Anderson & Co. (now Accenture), Federated Department Stores (now Macy's) and Coca-Cola Bottling Group. 


$19 million in fees 
Northlich, which has 155 employees and 2007 fee income of $19 million, is an integrated shop whose services include traditional agency, media, digital, public relations and brand and new-product consulting. Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.



Northlich handles accounts for national players such as Procter & Gamble Co. (including its professional products business, trade advertising, new-product consulting and corporate communications), Yum Brands (including the Long John Silver's advertising account won earlier this year and PR assignments for other brands), Birds Eye Foods and Brown-Forman (including Finlandia Vodka for which Northlich led a brand restaging in 2003). 



The agency also won renewal late last year of its long-running Ohio Tobacco Prevention Foundation account following a review, and it handles advertising for the Kentucky Lottery.


		Kathy Selker 
 	



Ms. Selker in an interview with AdAge.com said she sees potential for Northlich to continue to grow through acquisitions, such as the purchase last year of Interactive Ink, a Columbus, Ohio, digital shop, and through continuing to advance the five-part integrated-marketing communications model advanced by Mr. Serrianne.



The ownership change is the fourth in Northlich's history, with a senior agency executive taking control each time.


Diehard integrationists 
Mr. Serrianne said he wanted to keep Northlich as one of the Midwest's larger independent agencies -- and one of the diehard practitioners of integrated marketing communications, which the shop embraced when it was first popular in the early 1990s and stuck with as the concept's popularity waned, and then more recently waxed once more.



Northlich runs all five of its disciplines off a single profit-and-loss statement, an approach recently adopted by Publicis Groupe's  Leo Burnett Co. in configuring its Insight Group unit. Ironically, Leo Burnett, under prior Bcom3 ownership, tried to buy Northlich several years ago, according to people familiar with the matter, enticed largely by Northlich's BrandStorm consulting unit.



The consulting unit has been an entry point for several national accounts Northlich won for general advertising or PR duties over the years, Ms. Selker said, including Long John Silver's and Finlandia. 



Mr. Serrianne declined to comment on any specific offers from global holding companies, but said that "we've always had overtures." Northlich at one point in 2001 announced but later backed off a deal to merge with digital and relationship-marketing shop  Bridge Worldwide before the latter was acquired by WPP Group in 2005.


'Always been independent'
"We've always been independent, and my desire was to continue in that strategy," Mr. Serrianne said. "This is the perfect time. We've got the right leadership in place, the right kind of momentum going, so why not do it?"



Northlich long has been Cincinnati's largest advertising agency, though it may have been surpassed last year by Bridge, which had 175 employees as of last fall and is eclipsed in the city's marketing-services realm by design firm LPK, with more than 350 employees in Cincinnati.

Serrianne Takes NSL Ownership, CEO Title – Adweek                       FollowfacebooktwitterinstagramlinkedinFeed Subscribe     Brand MarketingAgenciesDigitalTV / VideoCreativity          Brand MarketingSerrianne Takes NSL Ownership, CEO TitleBy Scott Hume|February 2, 1998ShareBy Scott Hume|February 2, 1998ShareMark Serrianne has assumed principal ownership of Cincinnati agency Northlich Stolley LaWarre and adds the role of chief executive officer to his previous title of president. Bill LaWarre, who cedes both the CEO title and the principal ownership stake to Serrianne, continues as chairman of the $100 million agency. “This agency has a great history and has become even greater under Bill,” Serrianne said. “Our billings have doubled just since 1992, and we’ve moved from being a local/regional agency to emerge as a regional/national agency. My challenge is to maintain that development.” NSL has leveraged its role as a new-product development resource for Procter & Gamble to recently gain accounts from several major national marketers, Serrianne said. Those include the Luck’s food brands marketed by International Home Foods in Parsippany, N.J., and new-product launch work for H.J. Heinz’s StarKist Seafood unit.  “Our expertise in new-product development and strategic thinking is gaining us an entry with some of the largest advertisers in the country,” said Serrianne, who joined NSL in 1976. “That’s become a very important, defining niche for us that has helped our client list extend far beyond Cincinnati. I hope to help that grow [as chief executive officer].”  The agency’s new-product specialty group accounts for nearly 20 percent of its staff and may soon be branded with its own identity as a unit within the agency, Serrianne said. The agency’s other clients include Cincinnati Bell Telephone, ChoiceCare, LaRosa’s, Touchstone Securities, International Paper and Western-Southern Life Insurance.
