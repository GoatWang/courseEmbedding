The Irony of Wealth

Top-Ranked Wealth Management Firm
Houston Business Journal, 2016

Trust Company of the Year
Winner 2015

Isn’t it ironic that large, wealthy, complex families are not best served by large, complex institutions?
Dissatisfied with the level of service provided by the larger and less focused companies, two multi-generation families came together in 1997 to create a wealth management firm that focuses on the unique needs of affluent families and their closely held companies and foundations.
At Sentinel Trust Company, we see ourselves as trusted advisors, applying our knowledge, creativity, objectivity and experience to the singular task of meeting the needs of a small number of high net worth families.

Investment Services | Sentinel Trust Company
















































 
 






Investment Services
Sentinel’s investment services and processes are customized for taxable, multi-generational families who demand independent, objective and conflict-free investment advice and management. Our services are designed to meet client objectives rather than the firm’s profit goals and are grounded in these core beliefs and approaches:
Value Discipline—Sensitivity to valuation is always relevant to both risk and return, yet we are not a “value manager” as that phrase is used in the investment industry. Fundamentally, we believe that buying assets and increasing exposure to asset classes when they appear to be undervalued in the market, while selling or decreasing exposure to those that appear overvalued, will increase return and reduce risk over time. Many investors learned that lesson the hard way when, for example, the technology boom ended. Valuation always counts.
Tax Sensitivity—Taxes are important to high net worth families. Taxes should not be an afterthought, but we believe that taxes should not be the primary driver. Rather, the focus should be on after-tax returns. Taxes are considered throughout our investment process.
Avoiding Conflicts of Interest—Our clients must trust the objectivity of our advice. Therefore, our fee is fully transparent to you. We do not charge additional fees for participation in our investment vehicles or our internally managed domestic equities program. We do not accept compensation from anyone other than our clients. All clients (including founding families) invest side-by-side, with no preferences for investment opportunities.
Open Access + Internal Management—Our clients have access to the universe of managers; indeed, we employ over 100 external managers for our clients. However, we also offer in-house domestic equities management. Why? Few, if any, external managers practice our value discipline with the tax sensitivity required by taxable investors. We, therefore, created our own system to optimize investments for each client, using the tax basis of each position. Internal management also allows more tax efficient tactical movement of funds among managers and asset classes.
Multi-Dimensional Diversification—We strongly believe in the importance of diversification to reduce risk. Even the best markets, managers and asset classes fall in and out of favor. We construct diversification within each asset class and across a full range of asset classes, with appropriate diversification of managers. Click here for a listing of asset classes that we offer to our clients.
Holistic Portfolio View—Most wealthy families have significant business interests, investment positions and/or managers that they wish to retain. Sentinel customizes the balance of the portfolio with appropriate recognition of these matters to avoid further aggravating concentrations and reduce risk. We also structure investment activities with a multigenerational perspective, recognizing the different risk tolerances, return objectives and tax postures of each family member, trust and other entity.
Fee Sensitivity—Investment expenses, including our fees, are important. We strive to minimize them, but we believe that after-expense investment returns are more important to the investor.
Internal Investment Vehicles—We pool client funds to invest in a variety of asset classes. Each of these vehicles then engages underlying managers in a structure similar to a fund-of-funds but without the sponsor fees and conflicts of interest.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.
