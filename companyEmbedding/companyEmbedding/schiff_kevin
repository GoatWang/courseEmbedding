Two Columbus lawyers well versed in television advertising are suing a firm allegedly using their names without permission in online marketing.
Personal injury attorneys Scott Schiff and Kevin Kurgis have teamed up in a lawsuit against Exclusive Legal Marketing Inc., alleging the Texas company purchased their names as Google search terms so its own website would be prominently placed in search results for the two high-profile lawyers.

Schiff and Kurgis allege Exclusive Legal Marketing is scooping up visitors searching for them, then sending the leads to their competitors, with those potential clients led to believe they're speaking with someone associated with Schiff or Kurgis.




“Kevin and I have been competitors for 35 years, but we both try to do the right thing always,” Schiff told me. “We’re not going to tolerate unscrupulous and fraudulent attempts to defraud the public into hiring the wrong lawyers.”
The lawsuit against Exclusive Legal Marketing and founder Coety Bryant, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleges trademark infringement, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices, among other charges.
“They certainly have never hired these guys,” said attorney Joe Dreitler, of Columbus’ Dreitler True LLC, which is representing Schiff and Kurgis in the lawsuit.
Schiff and Kurgis each have trademark registrations for their names, and have built up their brands with years of TV ads. (You can see Schiff in action at his YouTube channel, and here is a collection of classic Kurgis ads.)




 


A recent Google search for “Kevin Kurgis” first turned up an advertisement for Exclusive Legal Marketing’s personalinjurycare.net, followed by a search result linking to KevinKurgis.com. Searching “Scott Schiff” also yielded the personalinjurycare.net ad as the top result, followed by an ad for Schiff’s services, although one not placed through Exclusive Legal Marketing, and then the link to ScottSchiff.com.
"Neither defendants not their client law firms have been licensed or authorized by plaintiffs to use their names for any commercial purpose, including as a keyword," Schiff and Kurgis said in their complaint.

Schiff and Kurgis are seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction, compensatory damages, treble damages, disgorgement of profits and costs and attorneys’ fees. They cite damage to their businesses, goodwill, reputations, profits and the strength of their trademarks.
A letter from Dreitler True requests Exclusive Legal Marketing cease using the Schiff and Kurgis names by Wednesday. It also requests information about the extent of business the company generated by using the search engine keywords.
A representative for Plano, Texas-based Exclusive Legal Marketing said in an email the complaint is “not even what you all think it is,” but declined to comment further.
Kurgis, who could not be reached for comment, has been operating his law office for more than 20 years. Schiff founded his firm in 1985.
Schiff said his 26-year-old son, Zachary Schiff, who works in his office, discovered the search results and contacted Exclusive Legal Marketing.
