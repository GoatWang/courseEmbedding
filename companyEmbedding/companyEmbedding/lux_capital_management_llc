A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.

LUX Capital

Company Logo
















Counter-conventional ideas are our specialty
About Lux


We are living in the sci-fi future of our imaginations.
Technology has given humanity superpowers. We can see through walls. We can turn bits into atoms and atoms into bits. We have self-driving cars and flying robots. We can also sense, build and control things we didn’t think were possible 10 years ago. Yet there is so much more to come.






Of Rebels & Scientists

We make long-term bets on contrarians and outsiders. We believe the next generation of industrialist titans will be scientists, technologists and inventors who are doing more than challenging the status quo—they’re literally challenging the laws of physics.
We partner with mission-driven entrepreneurs who possess an exceedingly rare intellect, a creative imagination and a radical vision. They are driven by the notion that science is the great equalizer.
They thrive in chaos. They are extraordinarily resilient. They work and play with knife-wielding robots, deadly lasers and contagious bacteria.
Our goal is to accelerate the widespread adoption of their most promising creations.
We take big risks on scientific and technological breakthroughs that have the potential for truly radical change.




How We Serve


INTERDISCIPLINARY THINKING
Our team and networks hail from different cultures, disciplines and experiences. We are chemists, computational biologists, data scientists, economists, electrical engineers, machine-learning hackers and neuroscientists, as well as philosophers, photographers, school-starters, scuba divers and street-art enthusiasts.


ALIGNMENT WITH YOUR VISION
We take a first-principles, scientific approach to analyzing new investments. We listen with an open mind and believe before others understand.


UNDIVIDED ATTENTION
When you need us, we are available and focused on finding uncommon approaches and solutions to serve your needs.


LONG-TERM THINKING AND SUPPORT
Our limited and general partners have long-term investment horizons and want to take an active role in designing the future.


CONTINUED FINANCING
We fund companies throughout their lifecycle, and we partner with the world’s most respected investors, providing access, capital and fund-raising guidance along the way.


CONNECTIONS AND COMMUNITY
Our investors and venture partners have built new industries and/or multi-generational empires. They serve as partners, direct investors and early customers for our companies.
Through our ƒ(Lux) events, we connect our founders to a diverse network of scientists, technologists and business leaders who are building ambitious, mold-breaking companies.





The Details

Lux is based in New York City and Silicon Valley. 
We are actively investing Lux Ventures V, LP, a $400 million fund. We have $1.1 billion under management. 
We invest in seed- and early-stage ventures across multiple sectors, including: 3D printing; machine learning; artificial intelligence; flying robots; surgical robots; synthetic biology; genomics; satellites; space; drones; computational imaging and recognition; new materials; holograms; “fixers” for the future; the internet of things; connected hardware; the smart home and virtual reality.
About our name: “Lux” is Latin for light—as in: We look where others aren’t and strive to shine a light on the unknown.
If you are a scientist, inventor or entrepreneur with an idea that can lead the world into a brighter future, we hope you will reach out to us.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.
