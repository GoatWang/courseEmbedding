History[edit]
Providence is led by Founder and CEO Jonathan M. Nelson and Senior Managing Director Paul J. Salem. The firm raises investment funds from a broad array of institutional investors, including pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, financial institutions, insurance companies, fund of funds, and high-net-worth individuals.
Providence partners with companies across different stages in their development, from growth capital and complex recapitalizations of family-owned businesses to large buyouts and take-privates. The firm targets equity investments of $150 million to $800 million and can employ a variety of financing structures.[1] Providence prefers to lead its investments, serve on company boards, and work collaboratively with company management.[9]
In 2008, Providence hired Thomas Gahan as president of the firm’s new capital markets group.[10] Prior to joining Providence, Mr. Gahan was head of Deutsche Bank’s corporate and investment banking in the Americas and chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank Securities. The credit platform has 18 investment professionals based in the firm’s New York office.[11]
Providence’s investments have included AutoTrader.com Group, Blackboard Inc., eircom, Hulu, Kabel Deutschland, MLS Media, NEW Asurion, Bluestone Television, Newport Television, Univision, VoiceStream (now T-Mobile US), Warner Music Group, Western Wireless, and World Triathlon Corporation (Ironman), YES Network, ZeniMax Media and TopGolf.[12][13]
Since 2010, significant investments by the firm include RentPath, Ambassador Theatre Group, Miller Heiman, Learfield Communications, The Chernin Group, GLM, UFO Moviez, Study Group, and Abacus Data Systems.[14][15][16][17][18] Providence’s recent exits by sale or IPO include iQivi, Hulu, YES Network, Decision Recourses, MobileServ (Phones 4U), Bresnan Communications, and Kabel Deutschland.[1][19][20][21] In March 2013, Providence and the National Football League formed a global partnership to invest primarily in sports and entertainment related media assets.[22]
In September 2012, Providence sold a less than 10% stake in the firm to Florida’s state pension system and a sovereign wealth fund.[23]

The firm targets equity investments of $150 million to $800 million and can employ a variety of financing structures.[1] Providence prefers to lead its investments, serve on company boards, and work collaboratively with company management.[9]
In 2008, Providence hired Thomas Gahan as president of the firm’s new capital markets group.[10] Prior to joining Providence, Mr. Gahan was head of Deutsche Bank’s corporate and investment banking in the Americas and chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank Securities. The credit platform has 18 investment professionals based in the firm’s New York office.[11]
Providence’s investments have included AutoTrader.com Group, Blackboard Inc., eircom, Hulu, Kabel Deutschland, MLS Media, NEW Asurion, Bluestone Television, Newport Television, Univision, VoiceStream (now T-Mobile US), Warner Music Group, Western Wireless, and World Triathlon Corporation (Ironman), YES Network, ZeniMax Media and TopGolf.[12][13]
Since 2010, significant investments by the firm include RentPath, Ambassador Theatre Group, Miller Heiman, Learfield Communications, The Chernin Group, GLM, UFO Moviez, Study Group, and Abacus Data Systems.[14][15][16][17][18] Providence’s recent exits by sale or IPO include iQivi, Hulu, YES Network, Decision Recourses, MobileServ (Phones 4U), Bresnan Communications, and Kabel Deutschland.[1][19][20][21] In March 2013, Providence and the National Football League formed a global partnership to invest primarily in sports and entertainment related media assets.[22]
In September 2012, Providence sold a less than 10% stake in the firm to Florida’s state pension system and a sovereign wealth fund.[23]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

EXECUTION VERSION



FINANCIAL ADVISORY
AGREEMENT


     This Financial
Advisory Agreement (this “ Agreement ”) is made
as of July 20, 2011, by and among Sterling Holdco Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the “ Company ”), SRA
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ SRA
”), and Providence Equity Partners L.L.C., a Delaware limited
liability company (“ Providence ”).



RECITALS:


     WHEREAS,
Providence, by and through its officers, employees, agents,
representatives and affiliates, have expertise in the areas of
corporate management, finance, product strategy, investment,
acquisitions and other matters relating to the business of the
Company and its subsidiaries; and


     WHEREAS, the
Company desires that it and its subsidiaries (together, the “
Company Group ”) avail themselves of the expertise of
Providence in the aforesaid areas, in which it acknowledges the
expertise of Providence;


     NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing recitals and the covenants and
conditions herein set forth, the parties agree as
follows:


     Section 1.
Initial Services . The Company hereby acknowledges that
Providence has provided consulting and advisory services to the
Company in connection with the merger of Sterling Merger Inc., a
Delaware corporation and subsidiary of the Company (“
Merger Sub ”), with and into SRA pursuant to that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 31,
2011, among Sterling Parent Inc., a Delaware corporation, Merger
Sub and SRA (the “ Initial Services
”).


     Section 2.
Oversight Services . During the term of this Agreement,
Providence shall render to members of the Company Group, by and
through such of Providence’s officers, employees, agents,
representatives and affiliates as Providence, in its sole
discretion, shall designate from time to time, advisory, consulting
and oversight services relating to strategic planning, marketing
and financial oversight of the operations of members of the Company
Group, including, without limitation, advisory and consulting
services in connection with the selection, retention and
supervision of independent auditors, outside legal counsel,
investment bankers or other advisors or consultants of members of
the Company Group (the “ Oversight Services ”
and, together with the Initial Services, the “
Services ”).


     Section 3.
Fees .


     (a) In
consideration of the performance of the Initial Services by
Providence, the Company shall, or shall cause one or more members
of the Company Group to, pay Providence on the date hereof a fee in
the amount of $11,820,000.


     (b) In
consideration of the performance of the Oversight Services by
Providence, the Company shall, or shall cause one or more members
of the Company Group to, pay to Providence or its designee an
annual fee of $1,750,000 (the “ Annual Fee ”).
The Annual Fee shall be payable in equal quarterly installments of
$437,500 in advance beginning September 30,

 



 


2011;
provided , however , that on September 30, 2011,
in addition to such quarterly payment, the Company shall, or shall
cause one or more members of the Company Group to, pay Providence
the pro rata portion of such fee for the period commencing on the
date of this Agreement, and ending on September 30, 2011,
calculated on the basis of a 365-day year. Fee payments shall be
non-refundable.


     Section 4.

Providence in cash in connection with its performance of the
Services, including, without limitation, ( i ) fees and
disbursements (including underwriting fees) of any independent

Out-of-Pocket Expenses shall be made promptly upon or as soon as

statement in connection therewith. Out-of-Pocket Expenses shall not
include expenses incurred solely for the benefit of
Providence.


     Section 5.
Indemnification .


     (a) The
Company and SRA (each, an “ Indemnifying Party
”) shall indemnify and hold harmless Providence and its
officers, employees, agents, representatives, members and
affiliates, including its related investment funds (each, an
“ Indemnified Party ”) from and against any and
all costs, expenses, liabilities, claims (including any third-party
claims), damages and losses (collectively, “ Losses
”) relating to or arising out of the engagement of Providence
pursuant to this Agreement or the performance by Providence of the
Services pursuant hereto, other than Losses finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be attributable to fraud of an
Indemnified Party.


     (b) The
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse any Indemnified Party for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and expenses) as they are incurred in
connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense of
any pending or threatened claim, action, suit, investigation or
proceeding (each, an “ Action ”) for which the
Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification under
Section 5(a), whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party
thereto, provided that, subject to the provisions of
Section 5(c), the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of such Action at its own expense, with counsel
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in its reasonable
judgment.


     (c) Any
Indemnified Party may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel
to participate in such defense, and in any Action in which Company
and any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and an Indemnified
Party, on the other hand, is or is reasonably likely to become a
party, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain, at
the Indemnifying Party’s expense, separate counsel
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party in its reasonable judgement
and to control its own defense of such Action if, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Party, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the Company and any of
its

subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and such Indemnified Party, on the other hand,
that would make such separate representation advisable.

Michael G. Mullen
Senior Advisor


Admiral Mike Mullen is a senior advisor of Providence and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States government’s principal military advisor.  Considered perhaps one of the most influential chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in history, Admiral Mullen takes a fresh approach to the most important issues of the 21st century—including America's global positioning and how business trends and the economic health of the U.S. directly impact our national security.
Admiral Mullen was widely recognized as an “honest broker” in his key leadership roles as the top military advisor to two presidents—Barack Obama and George W. Bush— as well as to the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council. He continues to maintain strong relationships with leaders around the globe. He led the military during a critical period of transition, overseeing the end of the combat mission in Iraq and the development of a new military strategy for Afghanistan. He advocated for the rapid development and fielding of innovative technologies, championed emerging and enduring international partnerships, and advanced new methods for combating terrorism—all of which directly culminated in the elimination of Osama bin Laden. As the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs to have attended Harvard Business School’s executive program, Admiral Mullen sought the advice of economists, entrepreneurs, non-profit practitioners and even embraced social media both to inform himself and strengthen ties between the U.S. military and the nation. In an unprecedented in-depth feature article, Fast Company, called Admiral Mullen “not just a new model for military officers—and a new kind of business titan—but also a case study in 21st-century leadership.” Prior to becoming chairman, Admiral Mullen served as the 28th Chief of Naval Operations.  Prior to that, he served in leadership positions at the Naval Academy, in the Navy's Bureau of Personnel, in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and on the Navy Staff. He was the 32nd Vice Chief of Naval Operations.
Today he shares with audiences his deep experience in leading change in complex organizations, executive development and succession planning, diversity implementation, crisis management, strategic planning, budget policy, congressional relations, risk management, technical innovation and cyber security.
Admiral Mullen is a graduate of the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Business School, received a Master of Science in Operations Research from the Naval Postgraduate School and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1968.
