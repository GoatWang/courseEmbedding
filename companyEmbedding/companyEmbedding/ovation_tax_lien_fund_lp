About Ovation







Boutique Firm.Innovative Ideas.














Ovation focuses on sourcing and structuring attractive private market investments. We work to reduce risk through strong collateral positions and secure, contractual cash flows.




Ovation began during the ‘Great Recession’ as a private investment vehicle funded by its co-founders and General Partners - Mike Rovner and Jeff Serra.  At a time when mainstream income investments were producing minimal returns, Jeff and Mike sought to leverage their financial services expertise to source income-generating opportunities with attractive yields and little-to-no correlation to the public markets.  Their approach emphasized principal protection, low volatility, and consistent income.    

		

Since 2010, driven by steady returns and a conservative approach, Ovation’s investor ranks have expanded. Today we are responsible for more than $500 million of assets under management across a variety of private credit and specialty finance asset categories. These assets may include (but are not limited to) tax lien transfers, real estate, single family rentals, auto dealer finance, equipment finance, insurance backed assets, non-performing debt, receivables finance, and small business loans. We strive to reduce complexity for our investors and manage these assets in a simple multi-strategy fund, the Ovation Alternative Income Fund (AIF).

While Ovation’s team and assets have grown over the years, a few things have remained unchanged.   Ovation’s founders are still among its largest investors, the firm remains focused on niche asset categories where expertise matters, and we continue to emphasize principal protection, low volatility, and consistent income.

Ovation Partners







Alternative Income Fund














Ovation Partners has the experience to navigate niche markets that don’t fit larger firms’ strategies.





Management Team



The Ovation Alternative Income Fund, LP (“AIF”) is a diversified, multi-strategy fund that primarily invests in income-producing private credit and specialty finance assets with meaningful collateral and contractual cash flows. The Fund’s objectives are to preserve our investor’s capital, generate returns with low correlation to public markets, and provide quarterly cash distributions. There can be no assurance, however, that the Fund’s objectives will be achieved.

AIF is diversified across strategies including (but not limited to) tax lien loans, municipal tax liens, first lien loans backed by real estate, insurance-backed assets, non-performing debt, equipment leases, small business loans, and receivables finance. Each of these assets requires specialized due diligence, origination, and servicing expertise that Ovation believes is uncommon in the asset management industry.

Ovation believes the resulting AIF portfolio provide these benefits to investors:
						
Portfolio Diversification. Income–producing private investments have historically been less correlated with public markets.
Current cash flow. A substantial portion of the total return of these investments is current cash flow distributable to investors.
Shorter duration. Most of the Fund’s underlying assets amortize over 6-60 months with average duration less than three years.
Meaningful Collateral. Ovation primarily targets asset-backed investments with low loan-to-values (“LTVs”) or deep purchase discounts.

FAQ
Ovation Services is a Loan Servicer specializing in Texas tax lien loans. We service loans on behalf of several investors and loan originators. WELCOME to our growing family of customers and providers!


» How do I contact you regarding my loan?


Visit the Contact Us page for all the ways you can get in touch with us.



»  How do I obtain my payoff amount?


Requests for payoff amount must be made in writing by the account holder or another party legally entitled to the information. Visit our Payoff Inquiries page for full instructions on how to obtain your payoff.



»  How do I sign up for automatic payments?


We can automatically draft your checking or savings account on your due date each month. To sign up for this free service, download the ACH Sign Up Form and email or send it back to us at the address on the form.



»  Is my payoff amount the same as my principal balance?


No. Your payoff amount will include interest to the date of payoff and any outstanding late charges, a fee to prepare a legally required Release of Lien, and any other fees which may be attached to your loan.



»  Can I make a principal payment at any time?


Yes, provided that your account is current. If your account is not current, payments are applied first to accrued interest & outstanding fees before being applied to principal. To make a principal payment, simply include any additional payments with your monthly payment or if you choose, send a separate check at any time. You can make your payment online using the 'Online Payments' link or by mailing your payment to the address on your most recent statement.
		If you send a check without a payment coupon which is attached to each month’s statement, you must include your loan number on the check.



»  Can I send extra money for my escrow account?


Yes, provided you have a loan account or other special account that has an existing escrow agreement. Please indicate the amount of the additional escrow payment you would like to make on your monthly coupon.



»  When is my loan payment due?


Most loan originators establish the due date as the 1st of every month with a grace period. Please refer to your loan documents or your monthly statement for your due date. Please note, payments are credited as of the date received not as the date mailed or postmarked.



»  I use online banking. Where do I send my loan payment?


Online banking payments should be mailed to the same address as listed on your monthly statement. You can also pay your loan online using ePay! SIGN UP NOW!



»  Why did my monthly payment change?


There are several reasons why this may occur, however you should have received documentation explaining the reason for the payment change. For example, if you have a mortgage loan, your payment may change due to escrow analysis. If you entered into a loan modification or forbearance agreement, your loan would also change. If the payment amount on your statement changed and you did not receive documentation explaining the reason for this change, contact us immediately!



»  Do you accept payments over the phone?


Yes. Pay-by-phone is an optional fee service which you may choose. When you call, the following information is necessary to process your request: your bank transit/routing number and account number. We will then process your payment from your checking or savings account within 24 hours. However, we encourage customers to use the free payment methods available!



»  Can I make my loan payment online?


Yes. Login to your account and then click ePay. If you have not established an online log on to your account, you may do so HERE.



»  Can I get my statement electronically instead of by mail?


Yes. Every customer who enrolls in automatic payments will also receive their statement electronically each month.



»  I haven't received my statement. How do I make my loan payment?


We mail monthly statements with a payment coupon upon receipt of your last payment. If you have not received a statement CONTACT US for a duplicate statement and payment coupon or for mailing instructions.



»  How do I get another copy of my monthly statement?


Contact our customer information center and request a duplicate statement. There is small fee for duplicate statements.



»  I just received a tax bill. Do I need to send it in for payment?


If you have a loan account and we escrow to pay your taxes, please retain the tax bill for your records. We will obtain a copy of your tax bill from our tax service. If you have a tax lien loan, part of your contract with your loan originator states that you must pay all future taxes on time. If you know that you cannot meet the tax deadline for this new bill call us at once so we can discuss your options. We can help!



»  What do I do if I receive a homeowners insurance bill?


One of the obligations of all customers is that you must maintain proper insurance coverage on your property. We can help with that!! Ovation Services can help you obtain a low quote for homeowners insurance.
If you have a mortgage loan and your monthly mortgage payment includes an escrow amount for homeowners insurance, please forward the notice to the following address:
Ovation Services
		ATTN Document Management
		8401 Datapoint Drive, Ste 1000
		San Antonio, Texas 78229

Tax Lien Records as Public Record
A tax lien is a type of lien imposed by the federal government to secure the payment of any taxes that an individual or business may currently owe to the Internal Revenue Service. Such a tax lien is generally imposed on those who owe delinquent taxes for real estate property or personal property. As a result to pay income taxes in a timely manner or any other type of taxes, the government and the IRS will usually impose a tax lien on the individual. This information will automatically become public record once it has been administered to your personal finance file at the Internal Revenue Service. Following the filing of such information, anyone has access to the tax lien records by simply performing a credit check on the individual in question. A credit check, which most just assume is to keep track of their own financial records, actually includes three types of public records, with bankruptcy being the most common, then tax liens, and finally civil judgments.


		    For tax lien records, this information will remain embedded with your credit report for up to 10 years after the filing date has been accepted and recorded at the IRS. A paid tax lien, however, will be removed after seven years from the date of filing - as long as it has been paid in full and the IRS and government is happy with the contribution. 


		    This information is collected and updated quite regularly by the government, who wishes to receive their money in the most timely manner possible from the individual or a business who owes back taxes. The information tends to stem from local courts, where either a representative or credit reporting company provides the information to the court and to any national companies. 


		    Of course, as with any public records or court filed documents, mistakes can, and often will, happen to the individual. Should this be the case, you are fully within your rights to dispute such instances just like one would with any type of credit account information. Such disputes generally run through online resources and websites, or by phone and mail, though those two options may take a tad bit longer to complete.


	      Without accessing public tax lien records, though, one would never know of any form of mistake that had been made on their own account. This is why it absolutely pays to check in one such information on the regular. If you, or someone you know, has a tax lien attached to their account or person, it would be best to continue keeping an eye on the situation using public record information. A tax lien ensures the government has their own stake and interest in a property owned by an individual. This is not beneficial to the property owner, and it can hurt their credit and their person after awhile. As a law-abiding tax payer, you should always keep track of your records. The Freedom of Information Act has made such instances possible and far easier than before.

Lien Records as Public Record
Ever since Congress passed the Freedom of Information Act back in 1966, numerous instances of warrants, liens, and property lien records have become available to the public - in many cases such information is completely free to the individual. Clerks of Court - those who maintain court case information throughout state and county courthouses across the country - retain all information and write down absolutely everything that comes into their house of law on a daily basis. Such information is then filed away as personal documents and tied to the individual. This information, including property lien records, can be access at any time by anyone throughout the United States.


		    A property lien is type of tax lien imposed by the United States government on land and property owners who owe taxes to the Internal Revenue Services. By implementing a property lien on the individual, the government is staking their claim on the property and acquiring interest. Should the individual who owes taxes to the government fail to repay the full amount within the time specified, the government and IRS are fully within their rights to take control of the land and the property, which will subsequently be sold to the highest bidder in an effort to see some form of return for the losses on taxes. If this is the case with your own situation, it really does pay to keep track of such property liens by using your given public access to any records and documents that could shed some light on the issue at hand.


		    Most online searches are incredibly easy to use, with a database entailing almost every name and property in the entire nation available for the public's viewing. Property assets and judgment recovery should also be listed in a public database. Plus, along with everything already mentioned and included, foreclosure status reports can also be found online by seeking property lien records on any business or property owner in the entire country. Court records can be found through online resource websites, offering information from the Supreme Court, State, District, and Court of Appeal courts for all civil cases and bankruptcy cases.


		    By using your public access abilities to find property lien records on any business or piece of land, you are capable of receiving a completely comprehensive report for the plot of land. This is perfect for those seeking to purchase a piece of land or to simply keep track of a plot for the near future when the individual may, or may not, go bankrupt via the United States government. Owing taxes is no joke these days, so chances are high of bankruptcy, unfortunately.


	      The best part of searching for such records online is how there are no monthly fees, memberships to pay for, or contracts to sift through. The information is readily available and quite comprehensive in all of its information offered. Everything you may require on property lien records will be included, all thanks to the Freedom of Information Act by the US Congress.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
