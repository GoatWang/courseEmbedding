                           worldwide
                           This volume is devoted to the paintings in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., that were produced by British
                              artists, or by foreign artists who spent the greater part of their working lives in Britain, from the sixteenth through the
                              nineteenth centuries. Composed mainly of paintings acquired by such prominent nineteenth-century industrialists as Andrew
                              Mellon and P.A.B. Widener, the core of this important collection is a series of portraits by such masters as Gainsborough,
                              Lawrence, Raeburn, and Romney, who represent the "golden age" of British painting. Brilliant landscapes by Constable, Turner,
                              and Wilson, among others, attest to another genre in which British artists have long excelled. Arranged alphabetically by
                              artist, full catalogue entries articulate the history, style, content, and context of each work, with technical notes offering
                              insight into the artists' working methods. The volume also contains introductory biographies of each artist, as well as an
                              up-to-date bibliography for each painting

                           "Once described as 'brilliant but eccentric ... too licentious to be published, ' Gainsborough's letters delighted his friends
                              and they delight us. This book gathers together all the known letters by the illustrious eighteenth-century British painter
                              and connects them with a narrative of Gainsborough's life that gives the correspondence a biographical coherence." "The letters
                              reveal a man who was generous and warm-hearted, devoted to his family and friends, convivial, often dissipated yet modest
                              and God-fearing, usually sensible in his own affairs and always so in the advice he gave to others. We also learn a great
                              deal about Gainsborough's painting: his methods and techniques, his attitude toward portraiture and landscape, his relationships
                              with his patrons, the prices he charged, his concern about how his pictures were hung, and his ambivalence about the value
                              of the Royal Academy exhibitions. Running through the letters, too, is his love of music and his friendship with musicians."
                              "The 110 letters, which include correspondence with Gainsborough's friends and relative, are supplemented by 37 documents
                              in the artist's own hand, chiefly instructions to his bankers and receipts for payments from clients. Illustrations are included
                              of all the people to whom Gainsborough wrote whose portraits exist and of friends and works of art described in the letters."--Jacket

                           This volume is devoted to the paintings in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., that were produced by British
                              artists, or by foreign artists who spent the greater part of their working lives in Britain, from the sixteenth through the
                              nineteenth centuries. Composed mainly of paintings acquired by such prominent nineteenth-century industrialists as Andrew
                              Mellon and P.A.B. Widener, the core of this important collection is a series of portraits by such masters as Gainsborough,
                              Lawrence, Raeburn, and Romney, who represent the "golden age" of British painting. Brilliant landscapes by Constable, Turner,
                              and Wilson, among others, attest to another genre in which British artists have long excelled. Arranged alphabetically by
                              artist, full catalogue entries articulate the history, style, content, and context of each work, with technical notes offering
                              insight into the artists' working methods. The volume also contains introductory biographies of each artist, as well as an
                              up-to-date bibliography for each painting

                           "Once described as 'brilliant but eccentric ... too licentious to be published, ' Gainsborough's letters delighted his friends
                              and they delight us. This book gathers together all the known letters by the illustrious eighteenth-century British painter
                              and connects them with a narrative of Gainsborough's life that gives the correspondence a biographical coherence." "The letters
                              reveal a man who was generous and warm-hearted, devoted to his family and friends, convivial, often dissipated yet modest
                              and God-fearing, usually sensible in his own affairs and always so in the advice he gave to others. We also learn a great
                              deal about Gainsborough's painting: his methods and techniques, his attitude toward portraiture and landscape, his relationships
                              with his patrons, the prices he charged, his concern about how his pictures were hung, and his ambivalence about the value
                              of the Royal Academy exhibitions. Running through the letters, too, is his love of music and his friendship with musicians."
                              "The 110 letters, which include correspondence with Gainsborough's friends and relative, are supplemented by 37 documents
                              in the artist's own hand, chiefly instructions to his bankers and receipts for payments from clients. Illustrations are included
                              of all the people to whom Gainsborough wrote whose portraits exist and of friends and works of art described in the letters."--Jacket
