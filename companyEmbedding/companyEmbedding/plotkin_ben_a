Description

                    The regime of Juan Peron is one of the most studied topics of Argentina's contemporary history. This book-an English translation of a highly popular, critically acclaimed Spanish language edition-provides a new perspective on the intriguing Argentinian leader. Mariano Plotkin's cultural approach makes Peron's popularity understandable because it goes beyond Peron's charismatic appeal and analyzes the Peronist mechanisms used to generate political consent and mass mobilization. Manana es San Peron is the first book to focus on the cultural and symbolic dimensions of Peronism and populism, this book explores the creation of myths, symbols, and rituals that constituted the Peronist political imagery. This well-written and engaging account of one of Latin America's most colorful and appealing leaders is an excellent resource on Argentina and Latin American history and politics.show more

Review quote

                            No theme in Argentin history has attracted greater scholarly scrutiny than Peronsim. Professor Plotkin's addition to this massive corpus focuses on a topic that, if not exactly understudied, seems less saturated than others: the nature and function of Peronist propaganda in political festivals, primary education, and semiofficial institutions. Plotkin's approach is consistently and scrupulously fair. Manana es San Peron provides an original perspective. Hispanic American Historical Review Well-written and well-researched.

Biography


Slacklining naturally balances and combines many of my lifelong passions. It requires flow state focus and intuitive movement, while giving me an opportunity to be outside, travel to spectacular locations, and be part of a unique and welcoming community. Slacklining also connects to my life as a Ph.D. student in experimental physics at the University of Washington.  In addition to walking lines, I love to understand and explain the physics of line motion and rigging forces. I started slacklining in 2004, but at that time I was focused on being an internationally competitive mountain unicyclist. Slacklining stayed in the background of my life until 2012, when I walked my first longline, and discovered that the sport was full of unexplored frontiers.  The watershed moment was at the Balance Community Backyard Highline Festival in March 2012, when I walked my first highline. By the end of 2012 I had walked highlines in Yosemite, Smith Rock, and Moab. In 2013 I established my first highlines, and helped to grow the longline and highline community in the Seattle area. My goals are to keep pushing myself on ever higher, longer, and looser lines, and to continue contributing to the slackline community in Seattle and beyond.
