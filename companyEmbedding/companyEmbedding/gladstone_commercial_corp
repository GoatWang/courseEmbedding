Gladstone Commercial Corp.: Dilutive Equity Offering Will Eliminate Dividend Coverage - Gladstone Commercial Corporation (NASDAQ:GOOD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Gladstone Commercial Corp.: Dilutive Equity Offering Will Eliminate Dividend CoverageJul.20.17 | About: Gladstone Commercial (GOOD) Old Time REITster Long/short equity, contrarian, REITs, micro-capSummaryFFO/Share for 2Q17 will miss analyst expectations due to ATM issuance.Today's offering will further pressure FFO/share.No update on Tewksbury lease expiration.No explanation for why the capital is needed.Summary In my May 1st article Picking Up Dividends in Front of a Refinancing Steamroller In the Fog of Inadequate Disclosure, I explained how Gladstone Commercial Corporation (NASDAQ:GOOD) would need to issue equity to shore up its balance sheet due to a history of paying out dividends far in excess of CAD and its upcoming mortgage maturities on properties that could not be refinanced due to the remaining lease term and the low quality of the tenant and/or the asset. An equity issuance will eventually lead to a dividend cut due to line of credit covenants that prohibit paying a dividend in excess of FFO. In the first quarter, GOOD covered its dividend on FFO/share basis by less than a penny. FFO exceeded the dividend by a mere $0.00372. Due to GOOD's equity issuance through its ATM during the second quarter and today's equity offering, FFO is certain to fall below the dividend. Why does GOOD need the money? Between the end of the second quarter and July 14th, GOOD issued 1,160,967. (This figure is calculated by subtracting the shares at the end of the first quarter from the shares listed on page S-7.) Assuming it sold these shares at $21.00 a share, it should have raised close to $24 million of equity. (We do not know if GOOD used its ATM between July 14th and July 20th.) It also could have sold preferred equity through its preferred ATM, but there is no disclosure in the prospectus. The two acquisitions mentioned in the prospectus cost a combined $42 million, but these properties are encumbered by mortgages, so it is unlikely that GOOD needed more than $20 million of equity for the transactions. GOOD has only disclosed the amount of the mortgage on one of the two properties. The prospectus provides no evidence that there are future acquisitions in the near term. It is likely that GOOD is simply raising equity whenever it sees an opportunity in order to prepare for the eventual repayment of the mortgages that are looming on the horizon. As shown below and discussed more fully in my May 1st article, there a number of mortgages that GOOD needs to address in the coming months and years where the refinancing proceeds will fall short of the existing loan balance.
 

 GOOD also likely needs cash to pay tenants for their recent lease extension. GOOD proudly announced two lease extension in recent weeks. These lease extensions will help extend GOOD's average lease maturity on the margin, which is getting perilously close to the minimum allowed under its line of credit covenants as was discussed in May 1st piece. The extension of the lease on the Mt. Pocono property will also facilitate the refinance of its mortgage at the end of the year. It is doubtful these lease extensions were free. Tenants do not decide to extend a lease that expires in four years without a significant inducement. Second quarter earnings probably not pretty While many REITs issuing equity before reporting earnings choose to provide investors with guidance on earnings, GOOD left investors to speculate on what might be in the second quarter numbers. Earnings will be pressured by a number of factors, including common and preferred shares issued through the ATM program, an increase in LIBOR (see my May 3 piece on earnings for a discussion of caps versus swaps), and a lack of acquisitions until the very end of the quarter. No update on the Tewksbury property At the end of the first quarter, GOOD had one remaining lease expiration for 2017. An office building in Tewksbury, MA, which was occupied by a printing company that probably has already moved out. The property has base GAAP rents of $428,000 annually. GOOD has not disclosed when in 2017 the lease expires. While the lost rent will only equate to $0.005 per quarter, given GOOD's thin margin for error when the move-out is disclosed and analysts adjust their models investors will notice. Summary Based on the limited information disclosed in the prospectus, it is hard to see how the equity GOOD has issued since the end of the second quarter in combination with the just announced equity offering will not significantly dilute FFO/share. Eventually, this will in turn force a dividend cut as line lenders will aim to protect their interests. While the cut may not come immediately, GOOD's history of overpaying its dividend and investing in lower quality high-yielding assets is coming closer to catching up with it.

 ("Gladstone Commercial") announced today that it has executed a 10-year lease extension with United Envelope, LLC ("United Envelope") at its 223,275 square foot industrial property in Mt. Pocono, PA. The lease extension will maintain the property's 100% occupancy with United Envelope through July 2031.        









United Envelope is an 85 year old envelope printing and manufacturing company providing direct mail and transactional envelopes to some of the nation's largest mailers.         
"We acquired this property in 2004", stated Brandon Flickinger, Managing Director of Gladstone Commercial Corporation, "and the lease extension by United Envelope confirms their commitment to this location in the I-81 northeast distribution corridor."


                                        








"I am proud of our team's continued successful leasing efforts in 2017," remarked Bob Cutlip, President of Gladstone Commercial. "Extending the term on this property further increases the weighted average remaining lease term in the Gladstone portfolio and further stabilizes same store rental income."

Gladstone Commercial: Your Diversified Net Lease REIT
Gladstone Commercial Corporation (NASDAQ: GOOD) is an equity real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in single-tenant and anchored multi-tenant net leased office, industrial and, to a lesser extent, medical properties nationwide.
We have a leadership team with more than 200 years of combined experience. Under their guidance, we’ve built a portfolio that generates predictable and durable cash rents to fund distributions to our investors. We have never cut our distributions to shareholders – even during the Great Recession. We have a track record of success, a history of strong distribution yields, consistent occupancy greater than 96%, and 10+ years of continuous monthly cash distributions.
A Portfolio That Performs
As of March 31, 2017, our portfolio includes 95 properties in 24 states leased to 88 different tenants. We have grown our portfolio 18% per year in a consistent, disciplined manner since our IPO in 2003, and have doubled assets since January 2011. Our occupancy stands at 97.9% and has never dipped below 96.0%.
 Our Approach to Investing
We invest in high quality properties located in primary and secondary growth markets occupied by tenants that meet our rigorous credit underwriting standards.
A net lease real estate investment company like ours thrives on choosing the right investment properties. We start with the real estate – we are looking for single-tenant and multi-tenant net leased office, industrial and, to a lesser extent, medical properties located in superior locations, in growing submarkets and with strong underlying land value. We analyze the building configuration, replacement cost and the competitive building set within the submarket. Finally, we ask, is this building mission critical for the tenant?
We are equally focused on the credit strength of our tenants. As part of the Gladstone Companies family of investment funds, we use insights from our corporate cash flow lending and private equity practices to properly qualify our commercial real estate investments — quickly and thoroughly underwriting the credit strength of any tenant’s business.
When we have identified an investment, it means we’ve found a well located property with features the tenant requires to operate their business and attract employees. While this sounds simple, our thorough sourcing and rigorous due diligence process results in the portfolio of solid commercial real estate investments we are known for.
 The Net Lease Advantage
Under a net lease, the tenant is responsible for operating expenses, taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance. A net leased property is advantageous for both investors and tenants because it allows for investors to focus on long-term performance of the asset with less day to day management, while allowing tenants to maintain the day to day control of the property and operating expenses.
 Why Gladstone Commercial?
Our experienced team, proven underwriting process and significant corporate resources give us an advantage — one that helps create the consistent and reliable distributions shareholders expect. We are a commercial real estate investment company with a track record of success, as exhibited by a history of strong distribution yields, consistent occupancy greater than 96.0% and 10+ years of paying continuous monthly cash distributions.
Contact us today if you have a property that may meet our investment profile, or to learn more about investing in Gladstone Commercial Corporation.
