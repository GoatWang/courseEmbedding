Vaccines













	iBio Technology
 



iBio Technology is the manufacturing platform of choice when rapid response to pandemic threats is paramount
Vaccines are increasingly being developed from recombinant proteins representing highly immunogenic proteins of the natural pathogen. In contrast to earlier vaccine technologies which used killed or weakened pathogens to stimulate an immune response, the newer "subunit" vaccines offer an improved safety profile, as well as the potential for a significantly simplified manufacturing and quality process. The iBio Technology delivers the improved safety and manufacturing profile demonstrated with subunit vaccines, but unlike competitor technologies, iBio's extremely rapid gene sequence-to-manufacturing timeline (as little as one month) makes the iBio Technology the manufacturing platform of choice when rapid response to pandemic threats is paramount.
Hookworms are parasitic nematodes that cause anemia and child development complications in infected individuals, most commonly in tropical and subtropical environments. iBio Technology is being used to produce a vaccine antigen to an enzyme found in the gut of the hookworm. Antibodies to this gut enzyme block its action, which normally acts to break down hemoglobin in the blood as a source of iron for the hookworm. When this gut enzyme is blocked, the hookworm dies, allowing infected patients to resume a healthier life. The antigenic form of this hookworm gut enzyme has proven to be impossible to manufacture efficiently using bacterial, yeast, or animal cell expression systems. However, commercially useful amounts of the antigen can be manufactured using the iBio Technology plant expression technology, and development of a vaccine in partnership with the Sabin Vaccine Research Institute is proceeding towards human safety and efficacy studies.
iBio Technology offers a breadth of application that is unmatched
The iBio Technology expression platform has been used to manufacture vaccine candidates that represent a broad range of viral, bacterial and parasitic threats to human health. The technology has been used to successfully produce vaccine components that could not be manufactured using bacterial, yeast or animal cell expression systems, demonstrating a breadth of application that is unmatched.
Each of these vaccines is available to be licensed from iBio along with the iBio Technology manufacturing platform, providing a turnkey entry into vaccine development and manufacturing





                        Yellow Fever                     




Yellow fever was the first human disease to be proven to be caused by a virus and is transmitted via a mosquito bite.
A highly effective vaccine (17D) was developed in 1937 by Max Theiler, for which he was later awarded the Nobel Prize. This vaccine is a weakened, but live version, of the virus and is produced in embryonated chicken eggs. However, like other vaccines produced in eggs, individuals who are allergic to eggs cannot receive the vaccine and others risk side effects, including neurologic effects and organ failure. Children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals should not receive the 17D yellow fever vaccine.
The side-effect profile has been increasingly unacceptable in regions of the world where yellow fever is present but acceptably managed. Because of these reasons, a next-generation yellow fever vaccine is of high importance in tropical nations and a subunit vaccine made in plants is likely to have an improved safety profile while at the same time being highly effective in protection.
In partnership with Fiocruz/Bio-Manguinhos of Brazil, iBio and its research collaborator, the Fraunhofer USA Center for Molecular Biotechnology, have undertaken the development of this next-generation yellow fever vaccine. A license agreement for the iBio Technology manufacturing platform applied to the yellow fever vaccine has been established with Fiocruz/Bio-Manguinhos and, by mutual agreement, may be expanded to include other product applications. 






                        Influenza                     




As part of its collaboration with external agencies such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Global Health Initiative and the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, subunit vaccines for avian influenza (H5N1) and pandemic influenza (H1N1) have been created and advanced into human safety and immunogenicity clinical studies. These vaccines consist of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) antigen, which is known to produce a protective immune response in humans. 






                        Malaria                    




A vaccine for malaria has been elusive, since the malaria parasite changes body forms during its life cycle and is kept hidden from the human immune system for much of its life.
The iBio-manufactured vaccine candidate is novel in that it is directed against a malaria parasite antigen. This is commonly displayed on the parasite forms present in the gut of transmitting mosquitos. Individuals immunized against this mosquito-borne form of the parasite share anti-malaria antibodies with the mosquito when the insect takes a blood meal, and these antibodies block the maturation of the parasites in the insect gut, ending the transmission cycle from mosquito to man and back to mosquito. This vaccine candidate, which has shown great promise in laboratory studies of malaria transmission, was developed in a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Global Health initiative. 






                        Hookworm                    




Hookworms are parasitic nematodes that cause anemia and child development complications and retardation in infected individuals, most commonly in tropical and subtropical environments. iBio Technology is being used to produce a vaccine antigen to an enzyme found in the gut of the hookworm. Antibodies to this gut enzyme block its action, which normally acts to break down hemoglobin in the blood as a source of iron for the hookworm. When this gut enzyme is blocked, the hookworm dies, allowing infected patients to resume a healthier life. The antigenic form of this hookworm gut enzyme has proven to be impossible to manufacture efficiently using bacterial, yeast, or animal cell expression systems. However, commercially useful amounts of the antigen can be manufactured using the iBio Technology plant expression technology, and development of a vaccine in partnership with the Sabin Vaccine Research Institute is proceeding towards human safety and efficacy studies. 






                        Human papilloma virus                     




Human papilloma virus (HPV) has been shown to cause a number of human cancers, chiefly cervical cancer, but also increasingly anogenital and oral cancers. There are multiple oncogenic serotypes of HPV and extensive efforts have been made to produce effective vaccines to prevent HPV infection. However, the iBio Technology has been used to produce an experimental vaccine to one serotype of HPV (HPV-16) which causes the regression and loss of established HPV tumors in an animal model. Such a vaccine in humans has the potential to treat patients with established HPV-related cancers, for which current therapeutic options involve surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment. 






                        Bacterial pathogens                     




The iBio Technology has been used to produce vaccines against plague (Yersinia pestis) and anthrax (Bacillus anthracis). The plague vaccine consists of two bacterial antigens (F1 and LcrV) and has been demonstrated in primates to provide complete protection against inhaled plague challenges when administered with an adjuvant.
A vaccine candidate to prevent anthrax infection has been manufactured and comprises a portion of the pathogen’s Protective Antigen and Lethal Factor proteins. Mice immunized with this dual-antigen vaccine made antibodies to anthrax which were successful in neutralizing bacterial infectivity in laboratory tests.

How it Works













	iBio Technology
 



The iBio Technology is a Unique Plant-Based Platform that Accelerates the Development and Manufacturing of High Levels of Target Protein




                        1                    


iBio scientists engineer vectors containing the target sequence within a viral replicon 




                        2                    


The vector is transferred to an Agrobacterium host that efficiently introduces target DNA to the plant cell nucleus. 




                        3                    


The viral replicon directs the production of large amounts of target-specific messenger RNA in plant cells, which is translated into protein by the plant’s own machinery for several days. 




                        4                    


Once the plants have been infiltrated with agrobacteria, the viral sequences of the launch vectors, along with the cloned target sequences, are massively amplified through the action of virally encoded enzymes.
Translation of these recombinant viral vector mRNAs can result in the accumulation of gram quantities of target protein per kilogram of fresh plant tissue in less than a week. 




                        5                    


The plants accumulate high levels of target protein in their leaf and stem tissue.
This expression of recombinant protein is termed “transient” expression because the target gene sequence is expressed as protein for a fixed period of time, and the foreign genes are not incorporated into the plant chromosome to result in the creation of transgenic plants. 




                        6                    


The plant biomass is harvested, homogenized, and clarified to produce an extract containing the protein of interest.
Proteins are further purified as required using conventional separation and chromatography steps widely used in the biopharmaceutical industry. 



Fast Development and Production
The iBio Technology dramatically speeds up drug development and production.
Due to entire plants not being required to be genetically modified, accelerated production and development is possible. By using non-GMO plants as manufacturing platform, the iBio Technology process eliminates the months or years needed by technologies using mammalian cells to find a high-producing, stable cell clone that can be expanded into the trillions of daughter cells required for manufacturing useful amounts of a drug.
Using The iBio Technology, a Novel Protein Product Can be Produced at Factory Scale in Under A Month
Once a desired gene is cloned into the iBio Technology vectors, it is introduced into the leaves of the plants by automated vacuum infiltration technology. Over the next 4-7 days, special features of the proprietary vectors ensure the gene spreads to every cell in the stems and leaves where the desired protein is expressed at extremely high levels.
Flexible Technology Allows for Agile Production
Since the growth of plants and introduction of the iBio Technology vectors is the same regardless of the desired product, a facility using the iBio Technology system can easily produce multiple proteins in the same facility without physical reconfiguration.

The Company's technologies include the natural protein production capability that plants use to sustain their own growth, and direct it instead to produce proteins for a range of applications, including for vaccines and biopharmaceuticals. The Company's technology is applicable in a range of product candidates, including products against fibrotic diseases, vaccines, enzyme replacements, monoclonal antibodies, and recombinant versions of marketed products that are derived from human blood plasma.The Company has developed its iBioModulator technology based on the use of a modified form of the cellulose degrading enzyme lichenase, from Clostridium thermocellum, a thermophilic and anaerobic bacterium. The iBioModulator technology enables an adjuvant component to be fused directly to preferred recombinant antigens to create a single protein for use in vaccine applications. The iBioModulator platform is applicable to a range of vaccine proteins. The iBioModulator technology platform is designed to improve the potency and duration of effect of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines produced with any recombinant expression technology, including iBioLaunch.The Company's technology platform, iBioLaunch, includes a range of technologies for the development and production of therapeutic proteins and vaccines using transient gene expression in green plants. The iBioLaunch process begins with robotic seeding into an inert matrix for hydroponic growth, followed by automated infiltration of the young seedlings for gene expression and protein production. The iBioLaunch vectors are designed to bring foreign deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to the nucleus of cells in the leaves of plants by allowing a vector and bacterial host to be introduced into the plant by infiltrating the bacterial vector host under a slight vacuum. The bacterial vector launches the foreign DNA into the plant nucleus, where it is coded into instructions that direct the plant's own protein manufacturing apparatus to make foreign proteins. An arrangement of genes for plant viral enzymes causes these protein production instructions to be copied several times in each plant cell. The Company's gene transfer vectors combine the desirable features of the DNA mobilization plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens with gene control elements taken from single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) plant viruses.The Company is developing its product candidate, IBIO-CFB03, for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). The Company has produced human C1 esterase inhibitor and human alpha 1-antitrypsin. The therapeutic proteins that the Company has produced, range from large and complex monoclonal antibodies to smaller proteins, such as interferons, growth factors, and enzymes. The Company uses iBioLaunch to express and demonstrate the feasibility of production of a range of vaccine candidates. The Company's vaccine product candidates for H1N1 Influenza and H5N1 Influenza have completed Phase I clinical trial. Its vaccine product candidate for Yellow Fever is in preclinical trial. Its vaccine product candidates for malaria and hookworm are in Phase I clinical trial. The Company is also developing vaccine product candidates for human papillomavirus (HPV). The Company's biodefense product candidate for anthrax is in Phase I clinical trials.

Receives FDA Orphan Drug Designation for Fibrosis Product CandidateMarketwiredJuly 5, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Jul 5, 2016) -  iBio, Inc. (  NYSE MKT :  IBIO ), a leading provider of plant-based biotechnology for developing and manufacturing biological products, announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to iBio's investigational biotherapeutic product, iBio-CFB03, for the treatment of systemic sclerosis.Systemic sclerosis is a fibrotic disorder that affects connective tissue of skin and internal organs as well as the walls of blood vessels. Early diagnosis and individualized therapy can be helpful, but treatment of systemic sclerosis is limited to symptom management. No approved drug currently available has been shown to arrest the underlying process or processes that drive progression of the disease."This is an important step toward our goal for a family of iBio proprietary products against fibrotic diseases like systemic sclerosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis," said Robert B. Kay, iBio's Executive Chairman. "We expect to apply for additional Orphan Drug Designations for products against additional fibrotic diseases. Viewed together and across the major geographic markets, effective therapies against fibrotic diseases are among the most significant unmet medical needs in the world."The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) grants Orphan status to drugs "intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases/disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S." Designation of an investigational drug as an orphan product indicates that the drug qualifies for the benefits specified in the Orphan Drug Act during development for the designated indication, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, orphan drug exclusivity, and an exemption from marketing application user fees. As per FDA guidelines, orphan drug designation, "does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval," such as establishing the safety and efficacy of a drug through adequate and well-controlled studies.About iBio-CFB03iBio-CFB03 is a recombinant, plant-made protein designed by iBio based on discoveries and inventions made by iBio's research partner, Dr. Carol Feghali-Bostwick. iBio licensed worldwide exclusive rights to her intellectual property covering iBio-CFB03 and related products and established a research agreement with the Medical University of South Caroline where Dr. Feghali-Bostwick is now the Kitty Trask Holt and SmartState® SC Centers of Economic Excellence Endowed Professor. The company is scaling up production of iBio-CFB03 for clinical trials at its subsidiary company, iBio-CMO LLC in College Station, Texas based on the use of proprietary iBio gene expression technology.Development of iBio-CFB03 as an anti-fibrotic agent is based on the involvement of endostatin in fibrotic disease, identification of endostatin's anti-fibrotic activity residing in the C-terminal region on which the design of iBio-CFB03 is based, and the efficacy of endostatin, its C-terminal peptides, and iBio-CFB03 in experimental models of fibrosis. iBio-CFB03 was developed by iBio using iBio CMO's capabilities to improve the solubility, stability, and purification of pharmaceutical-grade product versus the predecessor molecules.About iBio, Inc.iBio is developing proprietary products for the treatment of a range of fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and scleroderma. IBIO-CFB03, produced using the Company's proprietary gene expression technology, is the first product candidate from this program being advanced for IND development. The Company also offers proprietary products and product licenses to others based on its proprietary technologies, providing collaborators full support for turn-key implementation of its technology for protein therapeutics and vaccines.iBio CMO LLC is a 70 percent subsidiary of iBio jointly owned with affiliates of Eastern Capital Limited for development and large-scale manufacture of plant-made pharmaceuticals. The iBio CMO multiproduct facility includes laboratory and pilot-scale operations as well as large-scale automated hydroponic systems capable of growing over 4 million plants as "in process inventory" and producing over 300 kilograms of finished therapeutic protein per year. This translates into more than a half million doses per year of a typical therapeutic antibody and approximately 50 million vaccine doses every three weeks. Facility capacity can be doubled by adding additional plant growth equipment in a space already reserved for that purpose. iBio CMO's lease includes the right to develop another facility on the balance of the leased property that would have the effect of quadrupling capacity from the current level. iBio CMO offers a range of pharmaceutical product and process development, analytical, and manufacturing services.Read MoreIn Brazil, iBio has formed a subsidiary company, iBio do Brasil Biofarmaceutical Ltda., and has been collaborating with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) to develop a recombinant yellow fever vaccine based on iBio technology.

Holds Annual Meeting in College Station, TexasMarketwiredApril 7, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Apr 7, 2016) - iBio, Inc. (  NYSE MKT :  IBIO ) - Speaking to shareholders at the iBio, Inc. (  NYSE MKT :  IBIO ) Annual Meeting today, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert B. Kay highlighted the Company's most important achievements since its last Annual Meeting -- first, the creation of a new subsidiary for product development and large-scale manufacturing using the Company's proprietary plant-based technologies, and second, significantly advancing the Company's own product candidates against fibrotic diseases toward human clinical trials targeted to commence in 2016."We expect the contract manufacturing joint venture, between our recently formed subsidiary -- iBio CMO LLC -- and affiliates of Eastern Capital, to be transformative for iBio because we are now in a position to use our proprietary technologies to perform for our clients and ourselves each phase of biopharmaceutical development and commercial manufacturing from the early phases of product selection, innovation and development through full-scale commercial production," Kay said. "These new, comprehensive capabilities enable us to now provide a complete solution for product developer clients and ourselves."FY15 Highlights and AchievementsRobert Erwin, iBio's President, summarizing the Company's progress during the prior year described the commercial advances achieved with its technologies, including demonstrated time saving advantages for early stage product selection and development and also its advantages in eliminating both time-consuming cell line selection and then bioreactor scale-up once a product lead is selected. He then described some of the ways iBio is continuing to expand its capabilities by replacing older technologies with new proprietary inventions and methodologies."A good example of this is the success that has come from our engagement of Novici Biotech to create entirely new compositions of matter as prospective product candidates, develop and employ new methodologies to increase the production yield of iBio's and clients' products with a particular focus on monoclonal antibodies, and create novel gene expression vectors and process technologies," said Mr. Erwin. "Based on laboratory and animal tests, our product application successes include creating 'biobetter' versions of certain antibodies, some of which are for indications not yet addressed by commercial antibodies against viral diseases and some of which are derived from antibodies in current clinical use for cancer and infectious disease."We are applying the power of our proprietary technologies to benefit our own products in our collaboration with Dr. Carol Feghali-Bostwick's laboratory through which we advanced development of our lead systemic sclerosis product candidate, IBIO-CFB03, and also broadened our fibrosis portfolio to include novel therapeutic candidates of potential value for additional fibrotic disease indications. The success of this work has proven once again that our technology can overcome challenges against various difficult product opportunities, previous examples being antigens for malaria and hookworm vaccines."Development of IBIO-CFB03 as a Proprietary Therapeutic Product for Fibrotic DiseaseMr. Erwin described the ability of the Company's advanced technology to successfully modify product composition. He described how we were able to take our fibrosis product, initially produced by conventional chemical synthesis -- a slow and expensive process -- and more rapidly and less expensively produce a superior version using our proprietary technologies to make a recombinant derivative in plants. This transition reduced the projected cost of manufacturing large scale quantities of drug substance and also significantly improved the pharmaceutical properties of the active ingredient.Mr. Erwin also described the rationale for the Company's selection of systemic sclerosis as its first clinical indication in the fibrotic disease area, including that early stage clinical trials for systemic sclerosis will target endpoints that can be objectively measured more rapidly than is possible with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), making the path to demonstration of efficacy shorter. He disclosed and summarized the Company's pre-IND meeting with the FDA in December, 2015 in which preclinical toxicology, manufacturing, and clinical trial design plans were reviewed and discussed, and he commented on plans beyond the first clinical trial.Read MoreiBio's collaborator, and the lead inventor of IBIO-CFB03, Dr. Carol Feghali-Bostwick, spoke to shareholders about her enthusiasm for the steady movement of her research results toward the clinic and her experience with iBio as a part of her overall effort to alter the clinical course of fibrotic disease. She described the results of her use of human tissue explants in her research and discovery efforts and the significance of those results in providing confidence in the clinical prospects for IBIO-CFB03."My association with iBio continues to be a rewarding experience," said Dr. Feghali-Bostwick. "Together, we are expanding the range of possibilities for clinical application of this research, and look forward to soon see the first clinical trial begin."Regarding further plans and expectations for the fibrosis product development program, Mr. Erwin said, "We plan to request U.S. and European Orphan Drug designation for our product, first with systemic sclerosis and later for IPF. Based on preliminary laboratory data, we are also considering additional indications for other fibrotic diseases. We are optimistic about broadening and extending our fibrosis therapeutics intellectual property and managing this as a program rather than a single product."Expansion of iBio Patent PortfolioMr. Erwin described iBio's ongoing development of new patentable products and processes and listed the following U.S. patents issued during calendar year 2015:Plant viral expression vectors - US 8,951,791 SYSTEM FOR EXPRESSION OF GENES IN PLANTS   The iBioModulator™ carrier molecule system - 9,012,199 RECOMBINANT CARRIER MOLECULE FOR EXPRESSION, DELIVERY AND PURIFICATION OF TARGET POLYPEPTIDES   Vaccine antigen product candidates - 8,945,580 YERSINIA PESTIS ANTIGENS, VACCINE COMPOSITIONS, AND RELATED METHODS   Recombinant antibody product candidates - 9,115,201 HUMANIZED NEURAMINIDASE ANTIBODY AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF and also - 8,962,278 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR PRODUCTION OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS  Opportunity for iBio CMO to Become the Global Leader in Delivery of Plant-Made PharmaceuticalsMr. Douglas Hicks, iBio's Senior Vice President of Business Development & Strategy, provided an overview of plans to establish iBio as the leading supplier of plant-made pharmaceuticals to international markets. He described three categories of clients or collaborators expected to benefit from the combination of iBio's technology and iBio CMO's experience and capacity:Non-U.S.-based government entities, such as Fiocruz in Brazil, and corporations committed to the development and autonomous manufacturing of key biologics, including both vaccines and therapeutics Well-established companies seeking traditional contract manufacturing services combined with the benefits of plant-based manufacturing. Government and university laboratories and early stage biotechnology companies seeking collaborative problem-solving and product development"In the first case, we anticipate supporting our collaborators with product and process development services, initial manufacturing, and technology transfer under product-specific licenses from iBio, Inc., each of which represents a significant revenue opportunity," said Mr. Hicks. "In the second case, we expect to generate revenue by providing high quality manufacturing services for companies at any stage in their product development and manufacturing cycle. In the third case, we see opportunities for ongoing benefit to iBio and iBio CMO from successful early-stage joint product development with our collaborators."Operational Design and Capacity Features of iBio CMODr. R. Barry Holtz, iBio Senior Vice President, Product Development and Manufacturing, concluded with a review and summary of proprietary features built into the iBio CMO facility that are significant advances over earlier generation plant based methods. These include:Concurrent multi-product capability High and readily expandable capacity Custom designed LED illumination systems Large-scale automated hydroponic growth systems High-throughput, high-capacity vacuum infiltration system Flexible, moveable downstream process modules for rapid reconfigurationInternational Opportunities for iBio's Plant-Made Proprietary TechnologiesHoward L. Levine, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of BioProcess Technology Consultants, Inc. (BPTC), a firm that provides strategic, technical, and regulatory consulting services for the manufacture of biopharmaceutical products, and a contractor to iBio, described the basis for his optimism about the global opportunities for iBio's proprietary plant-made pharmaceutical technologies and the iBIo CMO capabilities. His comments included observations on efficiency and scale-up advantages of iBio's technology and the importance of commercial technology transfer in addressing important growing international markets.Collaboration Between iBio and the Texas A&M University SystemDr. James Abbey, Director for Global and Corporate Partnerships of The Texas A & M University System (TAMUS), discussed the planned Master Joint Development Agreement between iBio and TAMUS. The agreement is intended to facilitate a broad series of interactions that will form the basis of a center of excellence in plant-made therapeutics. The bioresearch and engineering expertise of Texas A & M and iBio's capabilities to develop and manufacture biopharmaceuticals will be focused on opportunities for new protein products such as vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. The following actions were approved by the Company's shareholders at the annual meeting, in each case by at least 90% of shares voted:Elected three directors each to serve as Class I directors for a three year term expiring at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders or until successors have been duly elected and qualified. Ratified the selection of CohnReznick LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 2016. Approved an advisory vote on executive compensation.

	About
 



What is iBio?
iBio (NYSE MKT:IBIO) develops and offers product applications of its iBio Technology platform, providing collaborators full support for turn-key implementation of its technology for both proprietary and biosimilar products. The iBio Technology platform is a proprietary, transformative technology for the development and production of biologics using transient gene expression in unmodified green plants. The technology has been validated in both preclinical and clinical studies, with interim positive results from a Phase 1 clinical trial of an iBio Technology platform-produced H1N1 Influenza Vaccine. iBio is actively engaged in a strategy to commercially license the iBio Technology platform across multiple markets and geographic regions to provide various revenue streams. Further information is available at: www.ibioinc.com.
What is the iBio Technology platform?
iBio Technology is a new method for the production of biotherapeutics and subunit vaccines in whole plants, bypassing expensive and complicated cell culture systems. The proprietary iBio Technology vector system utilizes the ability to efficiently introduce non-integrating foreign DNA into a plant cell nucleus by Agrobacterium plasmids to launch virus-based mRNA replication that takes over the plant cell's protein synthesis to produce any desired protein. The hybrid Agrobacterium/viral gene system does not permanently alter the plant's genetic makeup; it is not transgenic and does not result in the production of plant virus particles. Transfer of the iBio Technology vector to every cell in every leaf of the plant is near simultaneous, and within four to seven days the desired protein accumulates transiently in the plant leaves, where it can be easily harvested for purification. Unlike cell culture systems, the iBio Technology platform can be in production within weeks and does not require the time-consuming identification and isolation of high-producing cell clones which need to be scaled up for manufacturing. Additionally, the plants are grown in a soil-free, hydroponic medium under strict climatic and lighting controls for the highest degrees of reproducibility. No animal derived products or growth factors are utilized, eliminating the risk of human pathogens being introduced in the manufacturing process, and the expensive aseptic liquid handling process steps for cell culture are not required. The iBio Technology has been validated through the construction of a cGMP manufacturing facility that has provided clinical trial material for multiple FDA-approved studies.
What products can be made with the iBio Technology platform?
The iBio Technology platform has a wide range of commercial capability. Various proteins have been successfully produced with the iBio Technology platform and demonstrated, through preclinical and clinical studies, to be safe, efficacious, and to have anticipated biological functionality. These proteins include antibodies, interferons and cytokines, growth factors, protease inhibitors, clotting factors and enzymes for replacement therapy (Alpha-Galactosidase A). In addition, a variety of antigens for vaccines against diseases such as influenza, anthrax, malaria, sleeping sickness, plague and human papilloma virus have been produced, as well as several therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of acute treatment of influenza and anthrax infections. Virtually any protein that can be produced in prokaryotic or other eukaryotic expression systems can be made in plants with the iBio Technology platform with significant cost and pricing advantages.
Where did iBio get its technology?
iBio is currently developing CFB03, a protein derived from endostatin with demonstrated antifibrotic effects. CFB03 is produced using iBio's proprietary plant manufactured protein technology, and has been shown to arrest and reverse fibrotic disease in skin and lungs of preclinical models in both mice and human tissue. CFB03 is in a preclinical research phase, and is being developed initially for the treatment of diffuse systemic scleroderma.
Will iBio develop its own products?
iBio's investments to date have focused primarily on the development and application of its iBio Technology platform product. As iBio builds its revenue base through commercial alliances for the use of its platform technology, it may choose to invest in early-stage clinical development from the best of the preclinical product targets. The objective of the additional investment is to enhance the value prior to forming alliances with other companies for final development and marketing.
Since biotechnology products have been successfully produced for so many years, why is iBio Technology important now?
The iBio Technology platform has been validated in both preclinical and clinical studies, as well as vetted by multiple government and non-government organizations. Through these processes, iBio's technology has demonstrated qualities that present numerous advantages over previous methods of manufacturing biotechnology products as measured by time, cost, flexibility, and yield. These advantages are likely to radically alter the way these important but expensive biological products are produced. Compared to existing technologies, a manufacturing facility based on the iBio Technology platform requires less capital infrastructure and has lower operating costs because expensive bioreactors and aseptic liquid handling technology is not required to generate production biomass. The scalability and "simplicity" of the platform allow for modular growth and the ability to produce multiple products at a single facility. Using the iBio Technology platform, production cycles are reduced to days versus months for competitive processes. Since the platform contains no human or animal pathogens, the safety profile of platform products is more attractive. Finally, nearly unlimited surge capacity offers rapid response to pandemic disease threats or bioterrorism events.
What are the advantages of iBio technology for making biologics?
The key advantages of the iBio Technology are speed, simplicity, flexibility and lower cost. Unlike more conventional systems that fundamentally alter a host cell's DNA, there is no need to isolate and expand rare, high-producing cell clones to production level. A gene of interest can be cloned and inserted into the iBio Technology vectors and be ready for production at scale within a month's time. The transient nature of this powerful expression system allows the accumulation of massive amounts of desired protein over a four- to seven-day period when purification can then begin. The simplicity of the iBio Technology comes from the use of whole plants for the manufacturing of protein. These plants can be grown in chemically-defined medium in the open air or climate-controlled greenhouse, and do not require the expensive aseptic culture systems required to prevent contamination of cell culture production methods. The system is highly flexible, allowing the expression of vaccine antigens, monoclonal antibodies, replacement enzymes, blood cell growth factors, and many other products that cannot be produced by more traditional expression systems. Finally, the low cost of raising whole plants to provide the biomass for manufacturing obviates the need for expensive bioreactors and medium, as well as the lengthy and resource-intensive product development efforts seen with traditional cell-culture manufacturing.
Have products made with the iBio Technology been tested in human clinical trials?
Yes. Human clinical trials of products made using the iBio Technology platform began in 2010 with the initiation of Phase 1 clinical trials of an H5 avian influenza vaccine sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and a vaccine for H1N1 influenza sponsored by DARPA.
On June 2, 2011, iBio announced positive interim results from a Phase 1 clinical trial of an iBio Technology platform-produced subunit vaccine directed against Influenza A/California/04/09 (H1N1). The vaccine demonstrated a strong induction of dose correlated immune responses, with or without adjuvant, as assessed by virus neutralization assays and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI responses). The vaccine was safe and well tolerated at all doses when administered with and without adjuvant.
In addition to the two influenza vaccines that have completed Phase 1 studies, a transmission-blocking vaccine for malaria sponsored by the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), a hookworm vaccine sponsored by the Sabin Vaccine Institute, and a vaccine to protect from anthrax conducted at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research are currently in Phase 1 trials.
Why can iBio produce influenza vaccines faster than companies that use chicken eggs?
iBio's process is not dependent on being able to culture live viruses, to genetically engineer cell lines, or to produce large volumes of sterile starting material. Using the iBio Technology platform, a vaccine target can be produced in less than three weeks because the gene engineering process and the protein production processes are inherently faster than virus production in chicken eggs.
Why does iBio use green plants?
Plants carry out most of the same biochemical functions as human cells during protein synthesis and processing. iBio's technology provides a cost effective basis to use the ability of green plants to produce complex proteins ideally suited for human health applications.
Why is iBio Technology faster at producing than other plant-based protein companies?
iBio Technology is a third-generation plant-based protein expression technology. The first generation, which some companies still use, relies on the creation of transgenic plants with a foreign gene permanently incorporated into the plant's DNA. The second generation, still used by some companies, is based on transient virus-based infectious delivery of genes into non-transgenic plants. While this technology works rapidly, there are yield constraints and target product size limitations that limit its applicability. The iBio Technology harnesses the combined features of bacterial, viral and plant biology to achieve the speed of transient production without the yield and size limitations of older technology. Because iBio's technology is proprietary and protected by issued and pending patents, it is not available to companies using older or publicly available technology except through commercial agreements with iBio.
How is iBio's process less expensive than those used by other plant-based or mammalian cell-produced protein companies?
iBio's technology is more efficient than previous methods of manufacturing biotech products, as measured by time, cost, and yield, and is likely to radically alter the way these important but expensive products are produced. A manufacturing facility based on the iBio Technology platform requires substantially less capital for the same dose capacity as facilities dependent on cultured animal cells or the even older approach of using bacterial fermenters or chicken eggs. Unit manufacturing costs are significantly lower because the iBio Technology platform eliminates the need of expensive bioreactors. Additionally, iBio's technology includes proprietary features not available to companies using older or publicly available plant-based technologies. These features enhance the economic efficiency of the iBio Technology platform relative to others by providing higher yields and applicability to a broader range of products.
Is it safer to produce biologics with plants than with animal cells?
There are obvious contamination risks that exist with the current methods of producing proteins using animal cells in bioreactors. A good example of this type of contamination risk was demonstrated when a virus within a bioreactor shutdown production of a Genzyme facility in Allston, MA. The shutdown affected five Genzyme drugs used to treat rare genetic disorders, including two - Cerezyme and Fabrazyme - that were rationed due to short supply resulting from the facility shutdown. Animal viruses do not infect plants, relieving the risk of contamination of mammalian-based manufacturing systems.
Will there be problems obtaining FDA approval for pharmaceuticals made with plants?
The FDA is very familiar with the use of green plants to produce pharmaceutical proteins. In 2000, the FDA formed a working group with the USDA to provide a clear path for the use of plants in therapeutic protein and vaccine production. The FDA issued the draft Guidance for Industry: Drugs, Biologics, and Medical Devices Derived from Bioengineered Plants for Use in Humans and Animals in 2002 to set for guidelines on host plant selection, environmental considerations, process-related issues, and pre-clinical and clinical testing requirements. The approach the FDA takes to regulating vaccines and other biologics produced in plants is similar to their requirements for other methods of protein production in that product approval is dependent on the safety and efficacy of the product, and consistency and reliability of the production process.
Is there a risk with plants making human proteins incorrectly resulting in them not working for medical applications?
Plants properly synthesize virtually any protein a human cell can synthesize by carrying out the same biochemical steps, including correct signal sequence processing and proper protein folding and disulfide bridge formation. In some cases, glycosylation patterns may differ between plants and human cells, but these differences can be controlled and corrected if they are significant to the function of the product. Recent scientific publications have suggested that plant-manufactured antiviral antibodies.may be superior to those produced using mammalian cells due to enhanced killing of virus-infected cells.
Have pharmaceuticals or vaccines made in plants ever been tested in humans?
Yes. Human testing of products made using the iBio Technology platform began in 2010 with the initiation of phase 1 clinical trials of an H5 avian influenza vaccine sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and a vaccine for H1N1 influenza sponsored by DARPA.
The first human test of a therapeutic protein made in plants was conducted by NeoRx Corporation in 1997. The product was NeoRx's experimental cancer therapeutic, Avicidin, which incorporated a monoclonal antibody produced in transgenic plants by a unit of Monsanto Co. Unfortunately, although there were no problems with the quality of the plant-made antibody itself, the Avicidin product was not successful. About the same time, Planet Biotechnology tested a transgenic plant-derived antibody for the prevention of tooth decay in collaboration with Guy's Hospital in London. Transgenic plants have since been used to produce several products that have entered human clinical trials, including gastric lipase, interferon and insulin. The most advanced product is human glucocerebrosidase, produced in transgenic carrot cells by Protalix. Phase 3 human clinical trials have been completed and Protalix has submitted data to the FDA in support of an application for marketing approval.
Viral vectors were used to produce proteins for individualized treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a Phase 1 clinical trial conducted in 2002. The Icon Genetics unit of Bayer AG is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of individualized cancer therapy based on their transient expression technology for producing proteins in plants.
What is glycosylation and is it a problem?
Glycosylation is a natural process in yeast, plant, insect and mammalian cells whereby carbohydrate residues are added as side chains to a protein. Glycosylation can promote the correct folding of a protein into the three-dimensional structure required for the protein to function, and can also help the protein resist breakdown in the body. Glycosylation across species tends to have a common core structure, along with species-specific variations. In most cases, the common structure is sufficient to promote the correct folding of the protein, while the variations seen in different species serve to optimize the performance of the protein in that species. Plants are entirely able to add the common core structure, but cannot produce some of the variations seen with mammalian-produced glycoproteins without further manipulation of the plant system. However, these mammalian-specific modifications are, in most cases, not necessary for the proper function and bioactivity of a plant-manufactured protein; the abundant scientific literature in this area grows daily. Some of the mammalian-specific modifications can be useful in stabilizing the protein as it circulates in the bloodstream, but plant-derived proteins such as monoclonal antibodies have circulation half-lives comparable to mammalian produced versions. As a final consideration, the common mammalian expression systems come from rodent cells, which add rodent-specific sugars to proteins that have been shown to cause immune responses in patients receiving drugs manufactured in these systems.
What other technology is competitive with iBio's?
iBio's numerous advantages make it extremely competitive against traditional methods of producing biologics, such as animal cell bioreactors which are widely used by major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Due to its scope of capability and cost structure, the iBio Technology platform offers advantages over the new technologies such as cultured insect cells, transgenic plant technology and competing whole plant transient technologies, which either lack IP protection or have limited product capabilities.
Does iBio produce the final active ingredient or vaccine antigens used in products?
iBio is primarily in the business of licensing its platform technology to third parties for use in their own product manufacturing. In cases in which iBio would manufacture for a client, it would produce pharmaceutical grade protein (active pharmaceutical ingredient [API] or vaccine antigens for formulation into the final product by the client.)
What is iBio's relationship with Fraunhofer? Who owns the technology?
iBio has worked with the Fraunhofer USA Center for Molecular Biotechnology (CMB) since 2003 and owns the IP and technology developed there, including the iBio Technology platform. iBio's commercial rights are worldwide and exclusive in the field of human health and include limited rights to veterinary applications. iBio granted CMB an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to the technology for use in other fields. Under the terms of an existing multiyear agreement, iBio continues to accrue ownership of new technology with exclusive rights in the human health field in exchange for ongoing research funding commitments to CMB.
What is iBio's relationship with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation?
iBio and Fraunhofer established a license agreement at the request of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to address its interest in providing access to vaccines to the world's poorest countries through the Global Access to Vaccines Initiative (GAVI). Fraunhofer has received substantial funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to support development of vaccine products using the iBio Technology.
The license to Fraunhofer is non-exclusive and non-royalty bearing, and limited solely to Global Health Vaccines, which are vaccines for human or veterinary use for the prevention of malaria, tuberculosis, rotavirus, trypanosomiasis, hookworm and rabies. The Agreement establishes iBio's technology as the preferred manufacturer of these vaccines and provides a right of first refusal to iBio to provide technology transfer for manufacturing services to achieve Global Access Objectives on a commercially reasonable, competitive and sustainable cost basis.
Under the terms of the Agreement, Fraunhofer will use the iBio Technology to develop and test new GAVI vaccines funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In accordance with prior agreements, iBio will own new technology and improvements to existing technology arising during the course of the program at no cost to its shareholders.
Does iBio have patents on its technology?
As of February 2016 iBio had 20 issued US patents, 44 issued international patents and many pending applications.
Who are iBio's managers and board members?

NEW YORK, NY -- (Marketwired) -- 11/10/16 -- 
 iBio, Inc. (NYSE MKT: IBIO), a leading provider of plant-based biotechnology for developing and manufacturing biological products, announced completion of expanded product development capacity of its subsidiary, iBio CMO LLC, for the production of pharmaceutical proteins in hydroponically-grown green plants. This expansion enables iBio CMO's use of iBio proprietary technologies to conduct concurrent product development work for multiple clients in multiple product classes with time-saving transitions from laboratory-level feasibility and testing through cGMP production of active pharmaceutical ingredients for toxicology studies and phase 1 human clinical trials.
"An important consideration for many of our clients and prospective clients is our ability to save them time during critical stages of their proprietary product development programs," said Dr. Barry Holtz, iBio's senior vice president of product development and manufacturing. "We can provide definitive technical answers faster than conventional mammalian cell-based systems and then move directly into larger scale production. This avoids engineering and reengineering mammalian cell lines and dealing with the scale-up issues associated with traditional CHO cell production."
iBio is currently engaged in development of several vaccine and therapeutic candidates for third party clients and is significantly expanding its commitment to the monoclonal antibody product category. The pilot plant expansion enables the company to remain fully committed to its own proprietary anti-fibrosis therapeutics program while taking on promising programs with quality clients.
About iBio, Inc.
iBio is developing proprietary products for the treatment of a range of fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and scleroderma. IBIO-CFB03, produced using the Company's proprietary gene expression technology, is the first product candidate from this program being advanced for IND development. The Company also offers proprietary products and product licenses to others based on its proprietary technologies, providing collaborators full support for turn-key implementation of its technology for protein therapeutics and vaccines.
iBio CMO LLC is a 70 percent subsidiary of iBio jointly owned with affiliates of Eastern Capital Limited for development and large-scale manufacture of plant-made pharmaceuticals. The iBio CMO multiproduct facility includes laboratory and pilot-scale operations as well as large-scale automated hydroponic systems capable of growing over 4 million plants as "in process inventory" and producing over 300 kilograms of finished therapeutic protein per year. This translates into more than a half million doses per year of a typical therapeutic antibody and approximately 50 million vaccine doses every three weeks. Facility capacity can be doubled by adding additional plant growth equipment in a space already reserved for that purpose. iBio CMO's lease includes the right to develop another facility on the balance of the leased property that would have the effect of quadrupling capacity from the current level. iBio CMO offers a range of pharmaceutical product and process development, analytical, and manufacturing services.
In Brazil, iBio has formed a subsidiary company, iBio do Brasil Biofarmaceutical Ltda., and has been collaborating with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) to develop a recombinant yellow fever vaccine based on iBio technology. Further information is available at: www.ibioinc.com.
