Argus Research Co.


                  Founded in 1934, Argus Research Co. is an independent research firm located in New York City. The firm is a subsidiary of Argus Research Group, Inc. They produce, distribute and market high-quality investment and economic research.Argus employs a 6-point system for analyzing the stocks in their coverage universe. This system is based on a combination of top-down and bottom-up analysis. Argus begins with industry analysis. The first step involves formulating a forecast for the economy and interest rates and then collaborating with industry analysts to determine which industries are expected to perform well over the next 1 to 2 years. Within the industry, an analyst will determine a specific company's competitive position and its prospects. The second step of the process involves growth analysis. Looking forward, Argus forecasts growth in sales, earnings (operating or GAAP), dividends and cash flow for each company by studying growth in individual product lines, margins, industries and the economy. Looking backward, they smooth a company's historical growth rates in numerous metrics including balance sheet items and analyze them versus the company's peers and the market. In their analyses, Argus comments on the quality of a company's earnings. Financial strength analysis is the third step. The firm determines a financial strength rating for each company in their universe of coverage. To assess financial strength, Argus conducts ratio analysis to move beyond the financial statements and into the footnotes of a company's publicly available documents to fully evaluate obligations and opportunities. In this process, they attend meetings, presentations and road shows with senior managers, travel to corporate facilities and participate in conference calls. The fifth step of the firm's process involves risk analysis. Argus considers risk from both a qualitative and quantitative standpoint. On a qualitative basis, they review each company in the context of Harvard Professor Michael Porter's Five Forces model to determine potential threats. On a quantitative basis, they analyze proprietary data from their sister company, Vickers Stock Research, regarding institutional and insider ownership trends. Argus conducts a regression analysis to determine the correlation of a company's stock returns with the market's returns and to determine the predictability of the relationship. They also measure the volatility of key financial statistics such as sales and earnings growth and margins. Finally, Argus determines a fundamental floor for every stock in their universe through the final step in their process which is valuation analysis. The firm first compares a company against its peers on metrics such as p/e rations, price/sales ratios and dividend yields. Secondly, they analyze stock price activity in terms of annual sales, cash flow, dividends, book value, earnings and earnings relative to the S&P500. Argus determines normal ratio ranges for these parameters and then adjusts the ranges going forward. They apply the adjusted ranges to their key sales, earnings and cash flow forecasts to arrive at a normal trading range. Once the range has been determined, Argus uses 2- and 3-stage dividend discount modeling to arrive at a target price, which they believe can be achieved over a 12-month period.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
