History



The Company was founded in Range, Texas County, the Oklahoma Panhandle, in 1926, as Panhandle Cooperative Royalty Company and operated as a Co-op until 1979. At that time the Company was merged into Panhandle Royalty Company and its shares were registered with the SEC. On April 2, 2007 the Company's name was changed to Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc. The name change was made to clear up confusion as to the nature of the Company's business operations. Panhandle has never been a Royalty Trust and is not strictly a royalty company. The Company pays dividends on its common shares each March, June, September and December to each of its approximately 5,600 shareholders.Initially the Co-op issued one share of stock, par value $50, for 40 acres of minerals in a homesteader's 160 acre tract. While operating as a Co-op, the Company returned most of its income to shareholders as dividends. Upon conversion to a public company in 1979, though still paying dividends, the Company began to retain a substantial part of its cash flow to acquire additional mineral acreage and participate with a working interest in the drilling of wells on its mineral acreage. Several acquisitions of additional mineral acreage and small companies were made in the 80's and 90's, and the acquisition of Wood Oil Company was consummated on October 1, 2001.Currently the Company owns 255,000 fee mineral acres and a working interest and/or a royalty interest in over 6,200 wells. However, the Company does not operate any wells.

Proved ReservesThe following table summarizes estimates of the proved reserves of oil and gas held by the Company in approximately 6,200 wells. All reserves are located within the United States. All reserve quantity estimates were prepared by a consulting petroleum engineering firm.Because the determination of reserves is a function of testing, evaluating, developing oil and gas reservoirs and establishing a production decline history, along with product price fluctuations, it would be expected that estimates will change as future information concerning those reservoirs is developed and as market conditions change. Estimated reserve quantities and associated future net revenues are affected by changes in product prices, and these prices have varied substantially in recent years.Total Reserves Proved Barrels of OilMCF of GasBarrels of NGLMCFESeptember 30, 20121,072,319113,514,056788,742124,680,422September 30, 20131,643,303132,289,1671,616,126151,845,741September 30, 2014           7,569,579           142,492,3603,040,181206,150,920September 30, 20157,038,430120,214,0442,920,600179,968,224September 30, 20165,426,09081,725,5981,622,703124,018,356ProductionBarrels of Oil MCF of Gas Barrels of NGLMCFEYear-ended 9/30/12153,1439,072,29898,71410,583,440Year-ended 9/30/13234,08410,886,329111,89712,962,215Year-ended 9/30/14346,38710,773,559207,68814,098,009Year-ended 9/30/15453,1259,745,223210,96013,729,733Year-ended 9/30/16364,2528,284,377171,06011,496,249

The Company's total proved, probable and possible reserves at September 30, 2016, were 670 Bcfe. Panhandle does not operate any of its oil and gas properties. Exploration on and development of the Company's oil and gas properties are conducted in association with operating oil and gas companies, primarily large independent companies. The Company has been an active working interest participant for many years in wells drilled on the Company's mineral acreage and has been active in unconventional resource projects on its mineral acreage in several Oklahoma Woodford shale plays, the Arkansas Fayetteville shale and the Anadarko Cana Woodford, Meramec and Springer shales. The Company has also been active in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas, on held by production leasehold. Panhandle's activity in these projects began in 2007 and is expected to continue for many years as it has more than 4,800 gross potential drilling locations in these plays. Of the Company's 255,000 net mineral acres, 185,000 are currently unleased and undeveloped.
 Panhandle is not and has never been a royalty trust or partnership entity.

OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- PANHANDLE OIL AND GAS INC. (NYSE:   PHX), the "Company," today reported financial and operating results for the 2017 fiscal first quarter ending Dec. 31, 2016.








SIGNIFICANT ITEMS FOR FIRST QUARTER 2017

Recorded first quarter 2017 net loss of $2,238,392, $0.13 per share, compared to net loss of $2,799,118, $0.17 per share, for the 2016 first quarter. 
Recorded production of 2,517,414 Mcfe, compared to 3,143,400 Mcfe for the 2016 first quarter. 
Funded capital expenditures of $2.2 million for drilling and equipping wells for the 2017 first quarter with cash generated by operating activities of $3.7 million during the quarter. 
Collected $0.8 million from leasing mineral acreage in the 2017 first quarter. 
Reduced debt $0.4 million in the 2017 first quarter.

For the 2017 first quarter, the Company recorded a net loss of $2,238,392, $0.13 per share, compared to a net loss of $2,799,118, $0.17 per share, for the 2016 first quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 64% to $3,683,651 for the 2017 first quarter, compared to the 2016 first quarter. Cash flow from operating activities fully funded all capital expenditures of $2,174,523 for drilling and equipping wells for the quarter.
Total revenues for the 2017 first quarter were $7,051,673, compared to $11,462,125 for the 2016 first quarter. The decrease was largely due to increased losses on derivative contracts of $2,665,597 ($2.5 million of non-cash mark-to-market) in the 2017 quarter as NYMEX oil and natural gas futures experienced more of an increase in price in relation to the collars and the fixed price swaps. Oil, NGL and natural gas sales decreased $156,070 or 2% in the 2017 quarter, compared to the 2016 quarter, as a result of a 20% decrease in Mcfe production mostly offset by a 23% increase in the average sales price per Mcfe of production. Sales prices for oil, NGL and natural gas increased 17%, 46% and 34%, respectively, for the 2017 first quarter when compared to the 2016 first quarter. The average sales price per Mcfe during the 2017 first quarter was $3.54, compared to $2.88 for the 2016 first quarter.
Compared to the 2016 first quarter, first quarter 2017 oil production decreased 29% to 75,636 barrels, NGL production decreased 26% to 35,651 barrels and natural gas production decreased 17% to 1,849,692 Mcf. These production volume declines are the result of normal decline in the Company's producing wells. Drilling and completion capital expenditures for the last year have been below levels required to add new production sufficient to offset this natural decline.
Lease operating expenses decreased $517,121 in the 2017 quarter as compared to the 2016 quarter. The reduction was mostly the result of decreased production and operating efficiencies. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) decreased $2,123,389 mainly due to lower production and the DD&A rate per Mcfe decreasing $0.29 in the 2017 quarter. The rate decrease was primarily due to impairment expense in fiscal 2016 lowering our depreciable basis. There was no impairment expense booked in the 2017 quarter compared to approximately $3.7 million in the 2016 quarter.
OPERATIONS UPDATE
Drilling is now underway on five separate projects. Three are in the cores of low-risk resource plays, and the other two are in higher risk plays in the Permian Basin. 
In the STACK/CANA play, the Company is participating with a 17.5% working interest and a 16.25% net revenue interest in six Woodford Shale wells operated by Cimarex Energy. The first two wells have been drilled, wells three and four are drilling and wells five and six are scheduled to spud as soon as three and four finish drilling. Cimarex plans to drill all six wells before beginning completion operations. These wells are expected to be completed and start producing in the third quarter of 2017.
In the southeastern Oklahoma Woodford Shale, Panhandle is participating with an average 20% working interest and an average 27.4% net revenue interest in eight wells operated by BP. Six wells have been drilled and the last two are drilling. Four of these wells are currently being completed and are expected to begin production within the next 30 days. The remaining four wells are projected to be completed and start producing early in the third quarter of 2017.
Drilling has commenced with one rig on a ten-well continuous drilling program on our Eagle Ford leasehold. The first two wells are projected to be completed and start producing in April 2017. The next four wells are expected to start producing in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the remaining four wells should be on production during the first quarter of 2018. We own an average 13% working interest and 9.7% net revenue interest in these ten wells.
The activity in these three low-risk resource plays is expected to result in a material increase in daily oil, NGL and natural gas production as these wells begin to produce throughout the remainder of 2017 and into 2018. This activity will also result in a material increase in 2017 capital expenditures as compared to 2016.
In the Permian Basin, QEP Resources is currently drilling a two-mile lateral Woodford Shale well on our contiguous 43.6-square-mile mineral holdings in Andrews and Winkler Counties, Texas. Panhandle has leased its 2,440 net mineral acres in the block and is entitled to a proportionately reduced 25% royalty. We also have the right to participate with up to 10% working interest in each unit as initial unit wells are proposed. With full participation, Panhandle would have a 7% working interest and a 7.5% net revenue interest in wells drilled on the 43.6-square-mile block.
Also in the Permian Basin, Element Petroleum is evaluating the San Andres formation on a contiguous 34.5-square-mile acreage block in Cochran County, Texas. Panhandle leased 4,050 net mineral acres within this block to Element and has a proportionately reduced 25% royalty. We also have the right to participate with up to 10% working interest in each unit as initial unit wells are proposed. With full participation, Panhandle would have a 10% working interest and a 12.1% net revenue interest in wells drilled on the 34.5-square-mile block. Thus far, Element has drilled and cored four pilot wells and completed one salt water disposal well on and around our block. The operator has begun the process of reentering the pilot holes and drilling 1.5-mile laterals to test the San Andres Formation. The first lateral is being drilled and is scheduled to begin producing within the next 60 days. Element is in the process of staking an additional 20 locations on and around our block and plan to begin development activities if the initial wells are successful.
HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Prices received for oil, NGL and natural gas improved during the quarter, and recent NYMEX futures pricing suggests continued improvement for the remainder of 2017. To protect cash flows generated by the materially increased capital expenditures planned for 2017 and support the returns on those investments, Panhandle has elected to hedge a significant amount of projected 2017 production. We have 3.74 Bcf and 0.75 Bcf of natural gas volumes for the remainder of 2017 and 2018 hedged with costless collars with average floors of $2.87 and $3.44 per Mcf and average ceilings of $3.49 and $3.95 per Mcf, respectively. We also have 2.1 Bcf and 0.38 Bcf of natural gas volumes for the remainder of 2017 and 2018 hedged with swap contracts with average prices of $3.21 and $3.63, respectively. The Company has also hedged 183,000 barrels of remaining 2017 oil with costless collars with an average floor price of $49.18 per barrel and an average ceiling price of $56.73 and 69,000 barrels of oil with swap contracts that have an average price of $53.89. The aforementioned timeframes are based on calendar year.
MANAGEMENT COMMENTS
Paul F. Blanchard Jr., President and CEO said, "Like many other oil and gas companies, Panhandle experienced declining sales in 2016, due to low capital expenditures in the low product price environment. Prices for oil, NGL and natural gas improved during first quarter 2017, and recent NYMEX futures pricing suggests continued improvement for the remainder of 2017. As a result, we are experiencing a substantial increase in activity on our holdings.
"The Company has three low-risk high-potential projects under development, including drilling in the STACK/CANA Woodford Shale, the southeastern Oklahoma Woodford Shale and the Eagle Ford Shale. This activity is expected to produce material increases in daily oil, NGL and natural gas production as these wells come on line in 2017 and into 2018. This activity will also result in a material increase in 2017 capital expenditures as compared to 2016.
"We are evaluating higher risk exploration areas on our mineral acreage in the Woodford Shale in Andrews and Winkler Counties, Texas, and the San Andres formation in Cochran County, Texas. In both of these projects, we have the right to participate with up to 10% working interest in each unit as initial unit wells are proposed in addition to our proportionately reduced 25% royalty. If successful, these two Permian Basin plays have the potential to become Panhandle core areas.
"Going forward, we expect improved product prices along with material new oil, NGL and natural gas production from the low-risk drilling in the cores of our existing resource plays in 2017. We also have the possibility of adding two high-potential plays in the Permian Basin, which are currently being evaluated, as new active core areas. This multi-project and balanced-risk approach continues to demonstrate the value of Panhandle's proven operating strategies, which have positioned the Company to prosper as the industry begins to recover."

The Company's derivative contracts in place for oil and natural gas at Dec. 31, 2016, are outlined in its Form 10-Q for the period ending Dec. 31, 2016.
Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc. (NYSE:    PHX) is engaged in the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil. Additional information on the Company can be found at www.panhandleoilandgas.com.
Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors – This report includes "forward-looking statements," within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include current expectations or forecasts of future events. They may include estimates of oil and gas reserves, expected oil and gas production and future expenses, projections of future oil and gas prices, planned capital expenditures for drilling, leasehold acquisitions and seismic data, statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, and Panhandle's strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Although Panhandle believes the expectations reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to be correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under "Risk Factors" in Part 1, Item 1 of Panhandle's 2016 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These "Risk Factors" include the worldwide economic recession's continuing negative effects on the natural gas business; Panhandle's hedging activities may reduce the realized prices received for natural gas sales; the volatility of oil and gas prices; the Company's ability to compete effectively against strong independent oil and gas companies and majors; the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund reserve replacement costs; Panhandle's ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; uncertainties in evaluating oil and gas reserves; unsuccessful exploration and development drilling; decreases in the values of our oil and gas properties resulting in write-downs; the negative impact lower oil and gas prices could have on our ability to borrow; drilling and operating risks; and we cannot control activities on our properties as the Company is a non-operator.
Do not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release, as Panhandle undertakes no obligation to update this information. Panhandle urges you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this presentation and Panhandle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Panhandle's business.

Oversold Conditions For Panhandle Oil & Gas (PHX)
Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

YieldBoost Panhandle Oil & Gas From 0.8% To 12% Using Options
Shareholders of Panhandle Oil & Gas Inc looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 0.8% annualized dividend yield can sell the August covered call at the $22.50 strike and collect the premium based on the $1.15 bid, which annualizes to an additional 11.2% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 12% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $22.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but PHX shares would have to climb 10.3% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 15.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

PHX: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 01/31/2017 settlement date, and Panhandle Oil & Gas Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 7.55 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.13. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

Current PHX Stock Info




 


Founded in Oklahoma City in 1926, Panhandle Oil and Gas (ticker: PHX) boasts a foundation of 255,000 net acres of perpetually owned mineral rights spread primarily over Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.
Panhandle is in the position of holding large tracts of prospective acreage without operating that acreage. Instead, Panhandle allows large independent companies to lease and explore its holdings. Of its 255,000 holdings, 56,723 net acres are producing, 14,268 net acres are leased, and 184,038 net acres are open. Approximately 19,400 net acres of its leasehold are also held by production.
Panhandle conducts geologic, engineering and economic analysis for its active areas, and participates as a working interest in drilling when it determines that the risk-weighted rate of return is appropriate. Otherwise, the company leases its mineral acreage for the highest possible lease bonus and royalty percentage. When acquiring new mineral and leasehold interest, Panhandle uses the same geologic, engineering, and economic analysis to determine the value of the potential resource.
As of mid-2017, the company reported proved reserves of 140.4 Bcfe, 67% of which—93.9 Bcfe—is proved developed. The company estimates that approximately 4,800 proved, probable, and possible (3-P) undeveloped locations exist on its acreage—amounting to approximately 570 Bcfe of undeveloped (3-P) reserves.
Panhandle owns interest in 6,200 gross producing wells. Of those, Panhandle holds working interest in 2,200 wells; the remaining 4,000 wells have a royalty interest only. The wells with some degree of working interest provide Panhandle with 75% of its revenue, with the remaining 25% coming from royalty interests.
Panhandle has diversified its acreage holdings across most major producing fields, namely the STACK/Cana, SCOOP, Permian Basin, Granite Wash, Eagle Ford Shale, Woodford Shale, Fayetteville Shale, and the Bakken Shale.
Source: Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc.
STACK, CANA, and SCOOP Plays
Panhandle owns approximately 14,544 acres between the STACK/CANA and the SCOOP plays. Approximately 3.4 Mmcfe per day is produced from 256 wells in the company’s STACK/CANA and SCOOP acreage, by primarily large producers such as Devon, Cimarex, Continental, Newfield, and XTO.
New development in this region includes cooperation with Cimarex in six STACK/CANA Woodford wells, operated by Cimarex. Panhandle claims a 17.5% working interest in the wells and a 16.25% net revenue interest. The wells have all been drilled, with completion operations beginning shortly and production to follow in late June, 2017.
Woodford Shale interests
In Panhandle’s Woodford acreage, the majority of the 271 wells are operated by Newfield, BP, and XTO—producing approximately 7.1 Mmcfe per day. The acreage itself is comprised of 7,409 total acres. The company is currently participating in a total of eight wells operated by BP, with an average of 20% working interest and 27.4% net revenue interest. The eight wells have been drilled, with four wells producing approximately 4,000 Mcf per day net to Panhandle, and the remaining wells being completed as of mid-May and beginning production in late May.
Eagle Ford Shale
Panhandle’s Eagle Ford acreage is currently producing approximately 616 BOEPD out of 73 wells. The company maintains an average of 14.6% working interest and 10.9% working interest in 104 undeveloped locations. After the successful completion of a previously drilled and uncompleted well in July, 2016 an operator in Panhandle’s acreage developed a ten well drilling program, with all ten wells expected to be producing by Q4, 2017.
Big leases in the Permian Basin
As of Q1, 2017, Panhandle leased approximately 2,440 net acres in the Andrews and Winkler Counties and generated $1.2 million in lease bonus revenues from the lease. The terms to the company leasing the property are that Panhandle receive 25% of the production in the form of royalty payments.
In another Permian lease, Panhandle leased 4,050 net acres to Element Petroleum, and earned $2.1 million in lease bonus. Similarly, Panhandle stipulated that it would receive 25% of the production in the form of royalty payments.
Source: Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc.
Panhandle’s strength
Panhandle has developed a considerable economic advantage with its position as a non-operator. The fact that it owns mineral rights allows it to hold the land indefinitely without drilling. The company typically contracts with larger independent operators and—when participating as a working interest—choses wells that it wants to participate in. Panhandle has the advantage of not being involved in geoscience, engineering, and land costs; and only pays drilling, completion and wells costs when it holds a working interest.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.37      Net Money Flow ($)  82,546    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
