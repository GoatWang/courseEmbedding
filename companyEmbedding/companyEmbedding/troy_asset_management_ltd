Personal Assets Trust










Troy Asset Management Limited was appointed investment adviser to Personal Assets Trust on 3rd March 2009.

 





Investor AdviserSebastian Lyon
Trust ObjectivePersonal Assets Trust is an investment trust with the ability to invest globally. Its investment policy is to protect and increase (in that order) the value of shareholders' funds per share over the long term.
Trust Style

Personal Assets is run for private investors, who may often have committed to it a substantial proportion of their personal wealth. Its activities are defined not by any particular portfolio specialisation or investment method, but by a desire to satisfy the personal requirements of those who invest in it.
The Board's definition of "risk" is fundamentally different from that commonly used, ours being "risk of losing money" rather than "volatility of returns relative to an index". The Board will usually, although not invariably, prefer the Company's portfolio as a whole to have a lower level of risk than the FTSE All-Share Index.
The Company's policy is to ensure that its shares always trade at close to net asset value through a combination of share buybacks at a small discount to net asset value and the issue of new or Treasury shares at a small premium to net asset value where demand exceeds supply.

About Us









Troy Asset Management is an independent fund management company founded in 2000. Our investment style is unconventional, yet conservative.

 







 

Troy was founded to focus on absolute rather than relative returns, and aims to preserve and grow its investors’ capital over the very long-term. Over the years we have attracted other investors who share this patient attitude to investment management, including family offices, wealth managers, investment advisers, charities and endowments. 
Our aim is to keep investors’ costs down by maintaining a competitive fee structure and keeping portfolio turnover to a minimum. We do not charge performance fees – believing that we are rewarded by the loyalty of our investors.
For more information please see The Funds.
