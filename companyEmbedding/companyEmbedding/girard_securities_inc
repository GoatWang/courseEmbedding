Girard. The right-sized Broker-Dealer for you
There are large broker/dealers, there are small ones and there mid-sized broker/dealers. The big question is, what’s the right-sized broker/dealer for you?
We think it’s a broker/dealer that is small enough for you and your staff to develop strong personal relationships with the home office team and executive officers, yet large enough to provide you with access to flexible wealth management products and best-in-class technology solutions that empower you to run your practice at peak efficiency and meet the needs of all your clients, no matter what their age or financial needs.
Girard is that broker/dealer, and for four decades we’ve been committed to a unique culture of family, both the family given to us and the family formed from our partnerships with advisors and their staff.
If you’re looking for a broker/dealer where everyone knows your name, provides personalized, reliable and consistent service and best-in-class technology, then Girard is the right broker/dealer for you. Call us and start a conversation today.

Order Flow Routing
SEC Rule 606
17 CFR 242.606 Disclosure of Order Routing Practices
As required by this rule, every broker or dealer shall make publicly available for each calendar quarter a report on its routing of non-directed orders in NMS securities during that quarter.  NMS securities are divided into three separate sections for securities that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. and the American Stock Exchange LLC or any other national securities exchange.  This report shall be publicly available within one month after the end of the quarter addressed in the report.
Girard Securities, Inc. will post their order routing information on their web site no later than 30 days after the end of the quarter.  The information is accessed by clicking the link below “Go to Disclosures”.
Upon written request of a customer, Girard Securities will disclose the identity of the venue to which the customer’s orders were routed for execution in the six months prior to the request, whether the orders were directed or non-directed orders; and the time of the transactions, if any, that resulted from such orders.
Girard Securities makes order routing decisions based on a number of factors including the size of the order, the opportunity for price improvement and the quality of the order executions.  All client orders are executed in a manner consistent with best execution.
Girard Securities may route client orders for execution to the market centers or through automated order entry systems on primary exchanges.  These market centers may include dealers who make markets in these securities.  Girard may be paid compensation for routing orders to dealers and may receive credits for exchange transaction fees through the use of the automated order entry systems.

Business Continuity Plan
Summary Disclosure Statement
Our firm’s policy is to respond to a Significant Business Disruption (SBD) by safeguarding employees’ lives and firm property, making a financial and operational assessment, quickly recovering and resuming operations, protecting all of the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business.
Our plan anticipates two kinds of SBDs, internal and external. Internal SBDs affect only our firm’s ability to communicate and do business, such as a fire in our building. External SBDs prevent the operation of the securities markets or a number of firms, such as terrorist attack, a city flood or a wide-scale, regional disruption. Our response to an external SBD relies more heavily on other organizations and systems, especially on the capabilities of our clearing firms, National Financial Services and Pershing LLC. Our firm does not maintain custody of customers’ funds or securities, which are maintained at our clearing firms. In the event of an SBD, either external or internal, we will immediately identify what means will permit us to communicate with our customers, employees, critical business constituents, critical banks, critical counter-parties and regulators. Although the effects of an SBD will determine the means of alternative communication, the communication options we will employ will include our Web site, telephone voice mail, secure email and postal mail service.
In the event our clearing firms execute their plans, they represent that they will notify us of such execution and provide us equal access to services as their other customers. If we reasonably determine that our clearing firms have not or cannot put their plans in place quickly enough to meet our needs, or are otherwise unable to provide access to such services, our clearing firms represent that they will assist us in seeking services from an alternative source. Our clearing firms have the following SBD recovery time and resumption objectives: recovery time period of less than one day for each scenario mentioned above.
This plan is subject to modification, an updated summary will be promptly posted on our Web site and customers may alternatively obtain updated summaries by requesting a written copy by mail.
For more information – If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at (858) 622-2140 or mail@girardsecurities.com.
Trading Department Phone Numbers:
(800) 499-5502 or (619) 702-9661

Cetera Financial Group To Add Girard Securities


                                            August 14, 2014
                                                                    •
                                                                    
Dan Jamieson 






	RCS Capital Corporation said today that it has agreed to purchase Girard Securities Inc., a San Diego-based independent broker-dealer with 250 advisors and $10 billion under administration.

	The transaction is the latest in a string of deals by RCS Capital Corp. (RCAP) and its executive chairman, Nicholas Schorsch, together with Larry Roth, CEO of Cetera Financial Group, who runs RCAP’s retail advisor unit. Also this month, RCAP announced it was buying VSR Group Inc., a $12.3 billion Overland Park, Kan.-based firm with 264 advisors.

	About 60 percent of Girard’s business is done directly with product sponsors, 20 percent is general securities business and another 20 percent is fee-based. The deal is expected to close late this year or early next year.

	Together with VSR Group, the Girard acquisition will give RCAP a base of more than 9,700 advisors and close to $250 billion in assets. Girard will continue to operate under current management with the "Girard" brand, RCAP said.

	“We believe RCAP's commitment to maintaining the separate identity and culture of Girard was one of the most attractive aspects of this combination,” Susie Woltman Tietjen, Girard CEO, said in a prepared statement.

	Girard was founded in 1986 by Woltman Tietjen’s father, Richard Woltman, currently Girard’s chairman emeritus of the board. The senior Woltman, a pioneer in the independent broker-dealer industry, in 1975 founded the predecessor firm of First Allied Securities, which is now owned by RCAP. Woltman and his wife Kaye later acquired and merged Spelman & Co. Inc. and Sentra Securities Corp., eventually selling to SunAmerica Inc. Kaye Woltman passed away in 2010.

	Woltman Tietjen was not immediately available, but in an interview last April with Financial Advisor, she stressed the importance of personal relationships with advisors. “Bigger isn’t always better” for an independent firm, she told FA. “It just depends on how bigger is structured. Bigger can be better if the [large] entity understands the important of the service component and the relationship component.”

	One advantage larger firms offer is a bigger pool of potential partners for succession planning purposes, Woltman Tietjen told the magazine. In today's statement, she said the sale to RCAP will provide “greater opportunities for our advisors and a more diverse service offering.”

	Girard and VSR will be joining RCAP’s conglomeration of broker-dealers that operate as Cetera Financial Group. The group includes Cetera Advisors, Cetera Advisor Networks, Cetera Financial Institutions, Cetera Financial Specialists, First Allied Securities, the Legend Group, Investors Capital Corp., J.P. Turner & Company and Summit Financial Services Group.

Girard. The right-sized Broker-Dealer for you
There are large broker/dealers, there are small ones and there mid-sized broker/dealers. The big question is, what’s the right-sized broker/dealer for you?
We think it’s a broker/dealer that is small enough for you and your staff to develop strong personal relationships with the home office team and executive officers, yet large enough to provide you with access to flexible wealth management products and best-in-class technology solutions that empower you to run your practice at peak efficiency and meet the needs of all your clients, no matter what their age or financial needs.
Girard is that broker/dealer, and for four decades we’ve been committed to a unique culture of family, both the family given to us and the family formed from our partnerships with advisors and their staff.
If you’re looking for a broker/dealer where everyone knows your name, provides personalized, reliable and consistent service and best-in-class technology, then Girard is the right broker/dealer for you. Call us and start a conversation today.
