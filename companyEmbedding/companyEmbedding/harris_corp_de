History[edit]




Harris MR80C88 processor


The "Harris Automatic Press Company" was founded by Alfred S. Harris in Niles, Ohio in 1895. The company spent the next 60 years developing lithographic processes and printing presses before acquiring typesetting company Intertype Corporation. In 1957, Harris acquired Gates Radio, a producer of broadcast transmitters and associated electronics gear, but kept the Gates brand name alive by putting the Gates sticker on the back of numerous transmitters that were labeled Harris on the front panels.
In 1959, they acquired microwave technology company PRD Electronics of Brooklyn, New York.[citation needed]
In 1960, they merged with Radiation, Inc. of Melbourne, Florida, a developer of antenna, integrated circuit and modem technology used in the space race. The company headquarters was moved from Cleveland to Melbourne in 1978.[citation needed]
In 1969, Harris Corporation acquired RF Communications and Farinon, furthering its microwave assets. The printing operations were sold off in 1983 and are now known as GSS Printing Equipment. GSS Printing Equipment later acquired Lanier Worldwide, which itself was spun off from Harris Corporation in the late 1990s.[citation needed][clarification needed]
In 1979, Harris formed a semiconductor joint venture Matra Harris Semiconductors (MHS), from which Harris withdrew in 1989. After further changes MHS was taken over by Atmel.[8]
In 1988, Harris acquired GE's semiconductor business, which at this time, also incorporated the Intersil and RCA semiconductor businesses. These were combined with Harris' existing semiconductor businesses, which were then spun off in 1999 as an independent company, under the Intersil name.
In 1996, Harris Corporation formed a joint venture with Shenzhen Telecom Company to produce and sell Harris' digital microwave radios and integrate them with other systems.[citation needed][clarification needed]
In November 1998, Harris sold its commercial and standard military logic (semiconductor) product lines to Texas Instruments, which included the HC/HCT, CD4000, AC/ACT and FCT product families. Harris retained production of the Radiation Hardened versions of these products.
In 2005, the corporation spent $870 million on research and development.[9]
Harris Corporation developed a Hand Held Computer for use during the address canvassing portion of the 2010 United States Census.[10] Secured access via a fingerprint swipe guaranteed that only the verified user had access to the unit. A GPS capacity was integral to the daily address management and the transfer of information that was gathered. Of major importance was the security and integrity of the personal and private information of the populace.
In January 2011, Harris re-opened its Calgary, Alberta avionics operation, Harris Canada Inc.. The expanded facility's operations include among others the support of the work to be completed under the company's six-year, $273 million (CAD) services contract with the Government of Canada for the CF-18 Avionics Optimized Weapon System Support (OWSS) program.[11]
On December 2012, Harris Corporation sold its broadcast equipment operations to the Gores Group which operates as Harris Broadcast.[12] Harris received $225M for the transaction, exactly half of what it paid seven years earlier for Leitch Technology, its final acquisition for the Broadcast division.[13]
On May 29, 2015, the purchase of competitor Exelis Inc. was finalized, almost doubling the size of the original company.[14]
In July 2015, Harris Corporation sold its healthcare division, Harris Healthcare Solutions, to NantHealth.[15]
In January 2017, Harris sold off its government IT services division to Veritas Capital for $690 million.[16]
Business segments[edit]
Communication Systems[edit]
The Harris Communication Systems segment serves markets in tactical and airborne radios, night vision technology and defense and public safety networks.
Electronic Systems[edit]
The Harris Electronic Systems segment provides products and services in electronic warfare, air traffic management, avionics, wireless technology, C4I, undersea systems and aerostructures.
Electronic Systems (ES) division provides the "ALQ-214" radio frequency jamming equipment for the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 Hornet aircraft. The ALQ-214 was originally developed by Exelis ES, which Harris acquired in 2015.[17] ES is also a provider of components in the avionics package and targeting systems for the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 and EA-18 Growlers.[18]
Space and Intelligence Systems[edit]
The Harris Space and Intelligence Systems segment provides capabilities in Earth observation, weather, geospatial monitoring, space protection and intelligence, including sensors and payloads, ground processing and information analytics.[19]
Cell-site simulators[edit]
Harris Corporation produces multiple cell-site simulator products, such as the StingRay and Hailstorm phone trackers (see table below); These masquerade as legitimate cellphone towers duping mobile devices to connect to them instead of real cellular networks, so all wireless voice and data traffic originating in a given area are intercepted by the systems, enabling Stingray operators to conduct mass surveillance and triangulate the position of mobile devices.[20][21]
Originally developed for the U.S. Navy and later used in the global "war on terror" outside the US, they've increasingly been used by US police agencies.[22] More than six U.S. federal agencies use these platforms, including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) says at least 53 law enforcement agencies in 21 states, use this or similar devices.[23]
These platforms are controversial[24][25] as they surveil communications of all mobile devices in their vicinity, including those of individuals not suspected of any crimes.[26][27] Harris have been criticized by civil rights advocates for requiring local municipalities, police and state governments to enter into non-disclosure agreements (NDA)[28] and to conceal usage of these platforms from citizens and the courts.[29][30] Such NDA may violate public record and open access laws. The ACLU, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed two successful civil lawsuits over denied Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and violations of the public records laws of Florida.[31][32][33]
In September 2014, as a result of successful litigation, ACLU received documents and emails between Harris Corporation and the Federal Communications Commission relating to FCC approval of Harris' surveillance systems.[34] ACLU then sent a letter to FCC stating, in their view, Harris misled FCC Office of Engineering and Technology staff during the regulatory review process by falsely claiming the systems were only used in emergency situations and not criminal investigations.[35]
In 2006, Harris employees directly conducted wireless surveillance using StingRay units on behalf of the Palm Bay Police Department—where Harris has a campus[36]—in response to a bomb threat against a middle school. The search was conducted without a warrant or judicial oversight.[37][38][39][40]
In 2015, Santa Clara County withdrew from contract negotiations with Harris for StingRay units, noting the reason was the onerous restrictions imposed by Harris on what could be released under public records requests.[41]

The ACLU, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed two successful civil lawsuits over denied Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and violations of the public records laws of Florida.[31][32][33]
In September 2014, as a result of successful litigation, ACLU received documents and emails between Harris Corporation and the Federal Communications Commission relating to FCC approval of Harris' surveillance systems.[34] ACLU then sent a letter to FCC stating, in their view, Harris misled FCC Office of Engineering and Technology staff during the regulatory review process by falsely claiming the systems were only used in emergency situations and not criminal investigations.[35]
In 2006, Harris employees directly conducted wireless surveillance using StingRay units on behalf of the Palm Bay Police Department—where Harris has a campus[36]—in response to a bomb threat against a middle school. The search was conducted without a warrant or judicial oversight.[37][38][39][40]
In 2015, Santa Clara County withdrew from contract negotiations with Harris for StingRay units, noting the reason was the onerous restrictions imposed by Harris on what could be released under public records requests.[41]

Harris Corporation is an American technology company, defense contractor and information technology services provider that produces wireless equipment, tactical radios, electronic systems, night vision equipment and both terrestrial and spaceborne antennas for use in the government, defense and commercial sectors. They specialize in surveillance solutions,[2] microwave weaponry,[3] and electronic warfare.[4][non-primary source needed]
Headquartered in Melbourne, Florida, the company has approximately $7 billion of annual revenue. It is the largest private-sector employer in Brevard County, Florida (approximately 6,000).[5] The company was the parent of Intersil (Harris Semiconductor). Most of the wireless start-ups in South Brevard County were founded and are staffed by former Harris Corporation engineers and technicians.[citation needed] The company's Digital Telephone Systems (DTS) division was sold to Teltronics.
In 2016, Harris was named one of the top hundred federal contractors by Defense News.[6] In January 2015, Wired Magazine ranked Harris Corporation—tied with U.S. Marshals Service—as the number two threat to privacy and communications on the Internet.[7]

History[edit]




Harris MR80C88 processor


The "Harris Automatic Press Company" was founded by Alfred S. Harris in Niles, Ohio in 1895. The company spent the next 60 years developing lithographic processes and printing presses before acquiring typesetting company Intertype Corporation. In 1957, Harris acquired Gates Radio, a producer of broadcast transmitters and associated electronics gear, but kept the Gates brand name alive by putting the Gates sticker on the back of numerous transmitters that were labeled Harris on the front panels.
In 1959, they acquired microwave technology company PRD Electronics of Brooklyn, New York.[citation needed]
In 1960, they merged with Radiation, Inc. of Melbourne, Florida, a developer of antenna, integrated circuit and modem technology used in the space race. The company headquarters was moved from Cleveland to Melbourne in 1978.[citation needed]
In 1969, Harris Corporation acquired RF Communications and Farinon, furthering its microwave assets. The printing operations were sold off in 1983 and are now known as GSS Printing Equipment. GSS Printing Equipment later acquired Lanier Worldwide, which itself was spun off from Harris Corporation in the late 1990s.[citation needed][clarification needed]
In 1979, Harris formed a semiconductor joint venture Matra Harris Semiconductors (MHS), from which Harris withdrew in 1989. After further changes MHS was taken over by Atmel.[8]
In 1988, Harris acquired GE's semiconductor business, which at this time, also incorporated the Intersil and RCA semiconductor businesses. These were combined with Harris' existing semiconductor businesses, which were then spun off in 1999 as an independent company, under the Intersil name.
In 1996, Harris Corporation formed a joint venture with Shenzhen Telecom Company to produce and sell Harris' digital microwave radios and integrate them with other systems.[citation needed][clarification needed]
In November 1998, Harris sold its commercial and standard military logic (semiconductor) product lines to Texas Instruments, which included the HC/HCT, CD4000, AC/ACT and FCT product families. Harris retained production of the Radiation Hardened versions of these products.
In 2005, the corporation spent $870 million on research and development.[9]
Harris Corporation developed a Hand Held Computer for use during the address canvassing portion of the 2010 United States Census.[10] Secured access via a fingerprint swipe guaranteed that only the verified user had access to the unit. A GPS capacity was integral to the daily address management and the transfer of information that was gathered. Of major importance was the security and integrity of the personal and private information of the populace.
In January 2011, Harris re-opened its Calgary, Alberta avionics operation, Harris Canada Inc.. The expanded facility's operations include among others the support of the work to be completed under the company's six-year, $273 million (CAD) services contract with the Government of Canada for the CF-18 Avionics Optimized Weapon System Support (OWSS) program.[11]
On December 2012, Harris Corporation sold its broadcast equipment operations to the Gores Group which operates as Harris Broadcast.[12] Harris received $225M for the transaction, exactly half of what it paid seven years earlier for Leitch Technology, its final acquisition for the Broadcast division.[13]
On May 29, 2015, the purchase of competitor Exelis Inc. was finalized, almost doubling the size of the original company.[14]
In July 2015, Harris Corporation sold its healthcare division, Harris Healthcare Solutions, to NantHealth.[15]
In January 2017, Harris sold off its government IT services division to Veritas Capital for $690 million.[16]
Business segments[edit]
Communication Systems[edit]
The Harris Communication Systems segment serves markets in tactical and airborne radios, night vision technology and defense and public safety networks.
Electronic Systems[edit]
The Harris Electronic Systems segment provides products and services in electronic warfare, air traffic management, avionics, wireless technology, C4I, undersea systems and aerostructures.
Electronic Systems (ES) division provides the "ALQ-214" radio frequency jamming equipment for the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 Hornet aircraft. The ALQ-214 was originally developed by Exelis ES, which Harris acquired in 2015.[17] ES is also a provider of components in the avionics package and targeting systems for the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 and EA-18 Growlers.[18]
Space and Intelligence Systems[edit]
The Harris Space and Intelligence Systems segment provides capabilities in Earth observation, weather, geospatial monitoring, space protection and intelligence, including sensors and payloads, ground processing and information analytics.[19]
Cell-site simulators[edit]
Harris Corporation produces multiple cell-site simulator products, such as the StingRay and Hailstorm phone trackers (see table below); These masquerade as legitimate cellphone towers duping mobile devices to connect to them instead of real cellular networks, so all wireless voice and data traffic originating in a given area are intercepted by the systems, enabling Stingray operators to conduct mass surveillance and triangulate the position of mobile devices.[20][21]
Originally developed for the U.S. Navy and later used in the global "war on terror" outside the US, they've increasingly been used by US police agencies.[22] More than six U.S. federal agencies use these platforms, including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) says at least 53 law enforcement agencies in 21 states, use this or similar devices.[23]
These platforms are controversial[24][25] as they surveil communications of all mobile devices in their vicinity, including those of individuals not suspected of any crimes.[26][27] Harris have been criticized by civil rights advocates for requiring local municipalities, police and state governments to enter into non-disclosure agreements (NDA)[28] and to conceal usage of these platforms from citizens and the courts.[29][30] Such NDA may violate public record and open access laws. The ACLU, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed two successful civil lawsuits over denied Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and violations of the public records laws of Florida.[31][32][33]
In September 2014, as a result of successful litigation, ACLU received documents and emails between Harris Corporation and the Federal Communications Commission relating to FCC approval of Harris' surveillance systems.[34] ACLU then sent a letter to FCC stating, in their view, Harris misled FCC Office of Engineering and Technology staff during the regulatory review process by falsely claiming the systems were only used in emergency situations and not criminal investigations.[35]
In 2006, Harris employees directly conducted wireless surveillance using StingRay units on behalf of the Palm Bay Police Department—where Harris has a campus[36]—in response to a bomb threat against a middle school. The search was conducted without a warrant or judicial oversight.[37][38][39][40]
In 2015, Santa Clara County withdrew from contract negotiations with Harris for StingRay units, noting the reason was the onerous restrictions imposed by Harris on what could be released under public records requests.[41]

Harris Corporation is an American technology company, defense contractor and information technology services provider that produces wireless equipment, tactical radios, electronic systems, night vision equipment and both terrestrial and spaceborne antennas for use in the government, defense and commercial sectors. They specialize in surveillance solutions,[2] microwave weaponry,[3] and electronic warfare.[4][non-primary source needed]
Headquartered in Melbourne, Florida, the company has approximately $7 billion of annual revenue. It is the largest private-sector employer in Brevard County, Florida (approximately 6,000).[5] The company was the parent of Intersil (Harris Semiconductor). Most of the wireless start-ups in South Brevard County were founded and are staffed by former Harris Corporation engineers and technicians.[citation needed] The company's Digital Telephone Systems (DTS) division was sold to Teltronics.
In 2016, Harris was named one of the top hundred federal contractors by Defense News.[6] In January 2015, Wired Magazine ranked Harris Corporation—tied with U.S. Marshals Service—as the number two threat to privacy and communications on the Internet.[7]

History[edit]




Harris MR80C88 processor


The "Harris Automatic Press Company" was founded by Alfred S. Harris in Niles, Ohio in 1895. The company spent the next 60 years developing lithographic processes and printing presses before acquiring typesetting company Intertype Corporation. In 1957, Harris acquired Gates Radio, a producer of broadcast transmitters and associated electronics gear, but kept the Gates brand name alive by putting the Gates sticker on the back of numerous transmitters that were labeled Harris on the front panels.
In 1959, they acquired microwave technology company PRD Electronics of Brooklyn, New York.[citation needed]
In 1960, they merged with Radiation, Inc. of Melbourne, Florida, a developer of antenna, integrated circuit and modem technology used in the space race. The company headquarters was moved from Cleveland to Melbourne in 1978.[citation needed]
In 1969, Harris Corporation acquired RF Communications and Farinon, furthering its microwave assets. The printing operations were sold off in 1983 and are now known as GSS Printing Equipment. GSS Printing Equipment later acquired Lanier Worldwide, which itself was spun off from Harris Corporation in the late 1990s.[citation needed][clarification needed]
In 1979, Harris formed a semiconductor joint venture Matra Harris Semiconductors (MHS), from which Harris withdrew in 1989. After further changes MHS was taken over by Atmel.[8]
In 1988, Harris acquired GE's semiconductor business, which at this time, also incorporated the Intersil and RCA semiconductor businesses. These were combined with Harris' existing semiconductor businesses, which were then spun off in 1999 as an independent company, under the Intersil name.
In 1996, Harris Corporation formed a joint venture with Shenzhen Telecom Company to produce and sell Harris' digital microwave radios and integrate them with other systems.[citation needed][clarification needed]
In November 1998, Harris sold its commercial and standard military logic (semiconductor) product lines to Texas Instruments, which included the HC/HCT, CD4000, AC/ACT and FCT product families. Harris retained production of the Radiation Hardened versions of these products.
In 2005, the corporation spent $870 million on research and development.[9]
Harris Corporation developed a Hand Held Computer for use during the address canvassing portion of the 2010 United States Census.[10] Secured access via a fingerprint swipe guaranteed that only the verified user had access to the unit. A GPS capacity was integral to the daily address management and the transfer of information that was gathered. Of major importance was the security and integrity of the personal and private information of the populace.
In January 2011, Harris re-opened its Calgary, Alberta avionics operation, Harris Canada Inc.. The expanded facility's operations include among others the support of the work to be completed under the company's six-year, $273 million (CAD) services contract with the Government of Canada for the CF-18 Avionics Optimized Weapon System Support (OWSS) program.[11]
On December 2012, Harris Corporation sold its broadcast equipment operations to the Gores Group which operates as Harris Broadcast.[12] Harris received $225M for the transaction, exactly half of what it paid seven years earlier for Leitch Technology, its final acquisition for the Broadcast division.[13]
On May 29, 2015, the purchase of competitor Exelis Inc. was finalized, almost doubling the size of the original company.[14]
In July 2015, Harris Corporation sold its healthcare division, Harris Healthcare Solutions, to NantHealth.[15]
In January 2017, Harris sold off its government IT services division to Veritas Capital for $690 million.[16]
Business segments[edit]
Communication Systems[edit]
The Harris Communication Systems segment serves markets in tactical and airborne radios, night vision technology and defense and public safety networks.
Electronic Systems[edit]
The Harris Electronic Systems segment provides products and services in electronic warfare, air traffic management, avionics, wireless technology, C4I, undersea systems and aerostructures.
Electronic Systems (ES) division provides the "ALQ-214" radio frequency jamming equipment for the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 Hornet aircraft. The ALQ-214 was originally developed by Exelis ES, which Harris acquired in 2015.[17] ES is also a provider of components in the avionics package and targeting systems for the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 and EA-18 Growlers.[18]
Space and Intelligence Systems[edit]
The Harris Space and Intelligence Systems segment provides capabilities in Earth observation, weather, geospatial monitoring, space protection and intelligence, including sensors and payloads, ground processing and information analytics.[19]
Cell-site simulators[edit]
Harris Corporation produces multiple cell-site simulator products, such as the StingRay and Hailstorm phone trackers (see table below); These masquerade as legitimate cellphone towers duping mobile devices to connect to them instead of real cellular networks, so all wireless voice and data traffic originating in a given area are intercepted by the systems, enabling Stingray operators to conduct mass surveillance and triangulate the position of mobile devices.[20][21]
Originally developed for the U.S. Navy and later used in the global "war on terror" outside the US, they've increasingly been used by US police agencies.[22] More than six U.S. federal agencies use these platforms, including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) says at least 53 law enforcement agencies in 21 states, use this or similar devices.[23]
These platforms are controversial[24][25] as they surveil communications of all mobile devices in their vicinity, including those of individuals not suspected of any crimes.[26][27] Harris have been criticized by civil rights advocates for requiring local municipalities, police and state governments to enter into non-disclosure agreements (NDA)[28] and to conceal usage of these platforms from citizens and the courts.[29][30] Such NDA may violate public record and open access laws. The ACLU, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed two successful civil lawsuits over denied Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and violations of the public records laws of Florida.[31][32][33]
In September 2014, as a result of successful litigation, ACLU received documents and emails between Harris Corporation and the Federal Communications Commission relating to FCC approval of Harris' surveillance systems.[34] ACLU then sent a letter to FCC stating, in their view, Harris misled FCC Office of Engineering and Technology staff during the regulatory review process by falsely claiming the systems were only used in emergency situations and not criminal investigations.[35]
In 2006, Harris employees directly conducted wireless surveillance using StingRay units on behalf of the Palm Bay Police Department—where Harris has a campus[36]—in response to a bomb threat against a middle school. The search was conducted without a warrant or judicial oversight.[37][38][39][40]
In 2015, Santa Clara County withdrew from contract negotiations with Harris for StingRay units, noting the reason was the onerous restrictions imposed by Harris on what could be released under public records requests.[41]

     Financial results for Harris Corporation's RF Communications segment were as follows:




The RF Communications segment serves (1) U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical Communications 
and (2) Public Safety and Professional Communications markets.

U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical Communications Market

Harris designs, develops and manufactures a comprehensive line of secure radio communications products and systems for manpack, handheld, 
vehicular, airborne, strategic fixed-site and shipboard installations that span the communications architecture from High Capacity Line of Site, 
backbone radios to small soldier personal radios and tablet computers. The radios operate in various radio frequency bands, including high-frequency, 
very high-frequency, ultra high-frequency (UHF) and L-band, with higher frequencies supported for some of Harris' network backbone products. 
The company's radio systems are highly flexible, interoperable and capable of supporting diverse mission requirements. The Falcon families of tactical radios 
are built on software-defined radio platforms that are reprogrammable to add features or software upgrades. The Falcon radios also have the highest grade 
embedded encryption and provide highly mobile, secure and reliable network communications capability without relying on a fixed infrastructure. 
This capability allows warfighters, for example, to remain connected with each other and their command structures and support organizations. 
It also provides them the ability to communicate information and maintain situational awareness of both friendly and opposing forces, 
which are critical to both the safety and success of their missions. Harris' radio systems have been widely deployed throughout all branches 
of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and, in the international market, have been sold to more than 100 countries through the company's 
international distribution channels consisting of regional sales offices and a broad dealer network and have become the standard in many of those countries.

Harris' Falcon III family of radios is the next generation of multiband, multi-mission tactical radios supporting U.S. and international 
network-centric operations worldwide. The company's Falcon III radios address the full range of current mission and interoperability requirements 
and are fully upgradeable to address changing technical standards and mission requirements of the future. Advances in the company's Falcon III radios 
include the support of wideband networking waveforms, extended frequency range and significant reductions in weight and size compared with previous generations. 

Falcon III radios are used in a wide variety of ground, vehicular and airborne applications and include the following:
1) the AN/PRC-117G multiband manpack radio, which provides wideband networking capability, enabling enhanced situational awareness 
through high-bandwidth applications such as streaming video, simultaneous voice and data feeds, collaborative chat and connectivity to secure networks, 
and which is National Security Agency (NSA) Type-1-certified for narrowband communications, as well as for wideband communications using the Harris-developed 
Adaptive Networking Wideband Waveform for high bandwidth data operation and the U.S. military Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Soldier Radio Waveform;
2) the AN/VRC-118 2-channel vehicular radio system, which uses the DoD-developed Wideband Networking Waveform and was selected as the U.S. Army's solution 
for its JTRS Mid-Tier Networking Vehicular Radio program;
3) the AN/PRC-152 multiband handheld radio, which is the world's most widely fielded JTRS-approved software-defined handheld radio 
and offers a wide range of capabilities, and the AN/PRC-152A, which builds on Harris' AN/PRC-152 by adding wideband, networked communications capability 
and is the first radio of its kind to support both a full range of narrowband legacy waveforms and wideband networking waveforms in a handheld platform; 
4) the AN/PRC-158 multi-channel manpack radio, which is the first and only commercially developed, NSA Type-1-certified radio offering two channels 
integrated into the same chassis, and the wideband rifleman team radio;
and 5) the RF-330E, which is the commercially developed U.S. variant of Harris' widely fielded international soldier personal radio.

Public Safety and Professional Communications Market
Harris designs, builds, distributes, maintains and supplies wireless communications systems. The company's Voice, Interoperability, Data and Access (VIDA) 
network platform is a unified Internet Protocol (IP) based voice and data communications system that provides network-level interoperable communications 
among public safety agencies by supporting a full line of communications systems, including OpenSky, NetworkFirst, P25IP 
and Enhanced Digital Access Communication System. The company's VIDA network solutions currently serve as the backbone in some of the largest 
and most advanced statewide and regional communications networks in North America. Harris is also investing in next-generation, 
secure public safety-grade Long Term Evolution (LTE) solutions for voice, video and data applications.

Harris also offers a full range of single-band land mobile radio terminals, as well as the company's Unity family of multiband radios, 
including a handheld radio and a full-spectrum mobile radio for vehicles. The Unity multiband radios cover all public safety frequency bands 
in a single radio; operate on Association of Public Safety Communications Officials — International (APCO) P25 conventional and trunked systems; 
are backwards compatible with analog FM systems; and include advanced capabilities, such as an internal Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver 
for situational awareness, internal secure Bluetooth wireless technology and background noise suppression features. 
They also include true software-defined radio architecture that allows flexibility for future growth, including a software-only upgrade to APCO P25 Phase 2, 
the next-generation standard for mission-critical communications. The Unity radios' multiband, multi-mode capabilities enable a single radio 
to communicate with multiple organizations, jurisdictions and agencies operating on different frequencies and systems, providing a significant improvement 
over many current radio systems for U.S. public safety, which are not interoperable and thus require users to carry multiple radios or route transmissions 
through ad-hoc network bridges, often configured at the time of an emergency, and resulting in instances where agencies responding to a common incident 
cannot talk to each other. In fiscal 2015, the company introduced its new XG-15 portable radio, which provides public service workers with APCO P25 capability 
at a competitive price. Harris also offers dispatch console systems.

Revenues for the Government Communications Systems segment were $1,855 million in fiscal 2015 compared with $1,801 million in fiscal 2014. 
This segment contributed 37% of Harris' total revenues in fiscal 2015 compared with 36% in fiscal 2014.

     Financial results for Harris Corporation's Gov't Communications Systems segment were as follows:




The Government Communications Systems segment serves (1) Civil, (2) National Intelligence and (3) Defense markets.

Civil Market
Harris provides highly reliable, mission-critical communications and information processing systems that meet the most demanding needs 
of civilian U.S. Government agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
Harris uses its ability to implement and manage large, complex programs that integrate secure, advanced communications and information processing technologies 
in order to improve productivity and to achieve cost savings for the company's customers. The company's networks and information systems for large-scale, 
geographically dispersed enterprises offer advanced capabilities for collecting, processing, analyzing, interpreting, displaying, distributing, storing

and software receive sensor data from satellites and turn it into useable information.
 
Harris is the prime contractor and system architect under a 20-year contract awarded in July 2002, with a potential value of $5 billion, 
for the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) program to integrate, modernize, operate and maintain the communications infrastructure 
for the U.S. air traffic control system. Harris designed and deployed, and are currently operating and maintaining, the FTI network, 
which is a fully operational, modern, secure and efficient network providing voice, data and video communications deployed at approximately 4,500 FAA sites 
across the U.S. (including administrative sites supported by the FTI network).

Harris has recently been awarded multiple contracts for essential elements of the FAA's multi-billion dollar Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) 
initiative to transform the U.S. air traffic control system to meet future requirements, including:
7-year contracts, with an aggregate contract value of $481 million, for the Data Communications Integrated Services (Datacomm) program 
(including the Data Communications Network Service component) to transform voice-based air traffic control to automated air traffic management;	
a 15-year, $291 million NextGen National Airspace System (NAS) Voice System contract to create a modern Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network 
for communications among air traffic controllers, pilots and ground personnel;	 	
an 8-year, $238 million contract from the FAA for the Common Support Services Weather program to design and implement a system that provides real-time 
weather information across the NAS; 
and a 5-year, $63 million NAS Enterprise Messaging Service contract that provides the Systems Wide Information Management program with enterprise-wide 
data sharing for a variety of critical information such as flight planning, traffic flow, surface radar and weather.

Harris has also developed a number of other solutions under FAA programs, including a voice switching and control system providing the critical air-to-ground 
communications links between en-route aircraft and air traffic controllers throughout the continental U.S.; an integrated weather briefing 
and flight planning system for Alaska's general aviation community; a meteorological data processing system that generates radar mosaic data 
for air traffic controller displays and delivers weather data to critical subsystems within the NAS; and a satellite-based Alaskan NAS interfacility 
communications system linking the Alaskan Air Route Traffic Control Center in Anchorage with FAA facilities throughout the region.

Another example of Harris' capabilities relates to the NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite — Series R (GOES-R) 
Ground and Antenna Segment weather programs. Under two 10-year contracts, with an aggregate potential value of approximately $1 billion
