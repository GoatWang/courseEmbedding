Thoughtful Planning for Life & Legacy





















Advisors & Staff



Larry A. Kuyper, ChFC
Larry Kuyper began his financial career in 1977 helping farm families with insurance and estate planning.  He developed a proprietary system called LifePlan, which serves as a practical tool for his clients to plan and organize their estates. It efficiently transfers power and control of the clients’ financial matters to the people they trust at the appropriate time.
In order to serve his clients’ growing need for investment management, Larry, together with his business partner, Steve Buege, developed a private money management system that gives each individual client a personal investment portfolio. It allows clients of moderate means to have access to a private account, just as the very wealthy have enjoyed for generations.
In 2011, Larry turned his attention to the needs of the baby-boomer generation which is facing retirement in a difficult investment environment. Together with Sean Jamison, a Financial Advisor at LifePlan Financial, they researched and implemented a financial planning platform that gives pre-retirement clients a roadmap to follow for a successful future. It is an interactive process where clients can access their information online and watch their plan develop over time.
Larry is a Chartered Financial Consultant, a professional designation issued by the American College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. In addition to his professional work, he has served his church in a variety of ways, including Church Chairman, Financial Officer and Trustee. He is also on the Finance Committee for South Central College Foundation, North Mankato Campus.
Larry is co-founder and managing partner of LifePlan Financial, LLC (formerly Wealth Management Resources) a Registered Investment Advisory firm. He is known in southern Minnesota for his work in financial planning and investment management.
He and his wife, Renee, have been married over 35 years, and have three children and eight grandchildren. His hobbies include golf, bicycling, snow-skiing and hiking.

Stephen J. Buege
Steve grew up in Racine, Wisconsin and graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science degree in secondary education.  He has 24 years of Financial Advisory experience, including 14 years of Private Portfolio Management.  He has spoken extensively throughout southern Minnesota and northern Iowa on the topics of estate planning, income taxes, investments, retirement and long-term care planning.
He currently spends his day building and monitoring client investment portfolios based on the clients’ needs and the opportunities in the marketplace. This benefits our clients by giving their portfolios the full time attention of a qualified professional.
Steve and his wife, Theresa, have been married for over 28 years.  They have five children and two grandsons.  In his spare time, Steve enjoys “resistance training” (weight lifting), drinking coffee (he has even roasted his own coffee beans!) and riding his Harley Davidson Road King Classic.
 
W. Sean Jamison, CFP®
Sean joined LifePlan Financial as an Advisor in 2011.  His main focus has been to meet the needs of our pre-retirement clients.  With the increasing turbulence and uncertainty of the market, our clients who are approaching retirement need more planning than ever before.
Sean is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ and has implemented a financial planning platform that not only has the ability to factor in all the complex situations our clients face, but also makes it easy to see the bottom line and make decisions regarding their retirement.  As a CFP® certificant, he always puts our clients’ interests first.
Sean graduated from Bethel University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Marketing. Prior to joining LifePlan Financial, Sean was an Account Executive for an energy consulting firm, assisting corporations and institutions with forecasting their energy costs and managing their financial risk.  Sean was very pleased to combine his experience in forecasting and risk management with the personal connection of working with individual clients.  If you are interested in seeing what your roadmap to retirement looks like, please feel free to contact us and we can begin developing your financial plan that is completely customized to your needs, wants, and wishes.
Sean and his wife, Andrea, and their four boys enjoy spending their time biking, hiking, and generally anything that involves the outdoors.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 12/24/2007
            

                BBB has determined that LifePlan Financial Group, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by:

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Cajun Schot
Office Manager










 

harald@lifeplanfinancial.net
360-419-0100 




Cajun was hired for his good looks and surely not his qualifications or capabilities as LifePlan’s Office Manager. He has a reputation for slacking off and even sleeping on the job. He doesn’t show up to work on time (if at all), takes frequent breaks and his typing is both slow and inaccurate. Although he is sweet and harmless by nature (even afraid of his own shadow) his people skills also need work as he rudely barks at everyone who enters the office. However, he remains gainfully employed in a blatant case of nepotism.

You’ve Worked Hard For Your Money.
We’ll Work Just As Hard To Help You Protect And Grow It.








Will I Run Out Of Money In Retirement?When can I afford to Retire? How do I know if I have enough? These are common questions that need to get answered to provide peace of mind and confidence. This is a big concern of the Baby Boomer Generation. No matter have much you have, you need the confidence it will last.
Will I Be Able To Enjoy A Comfortable Retirement?Now, more than ever before, retirees are scared to spend the money they have because they fear losing it.It’s important to have the confidence to enjoy your money now and the confidence that it will last. 
Will I Be Able To Afford The Healthcare I Need, When I Need It?Increasing medical costs, unexpected health issues. This is a concern that needs addressed.As life expectancy increases, we all know someone who needs additional medical support. Do you have a plan to cover those costs?





You’re Not Alone. Discover How We Help Our Clients.



I want to know!





We Are Proud To Put Our Clients’ Interests First
We work with our clients as a 

fiduciary. Simple put, by law we are required to put our clients’ interest above our own.





The financial industry is regulated with two different standards: a suitability standard and a fiduciary standard. It’s important to work with an advisor who sits on your side of the table, who truly works for you, not a brokerage company. Discover the fiduciary experience – no pressure, no hidden or unexpected fees, and no canned solutions. We work for you and provide knowledgeable guidance specific to your situation.




				Have you thought much about how financial advisors are licensed or get paid? It’s important to understand their bias or conflict of interest. Have you ever been curious of the answers to any of these questions: I trust my advisor, but who does my advisor trust? How does my advisor make money? Am I being sold products or being advised? We believe in the power of these answers. Learn more about the LifePlan Difference.





My goal when I started this journey over 20 years ago, was to build a firm that would educate, empower, and help our clients see, perhaps for the first time in their lives, the picture of the future they want to build for themselves.Ken Sutherland, President
