Robert Clark


Hello!
Clark & Clark Specialty Products, Inc. was founded in 1989 with the introduction of our first product: the polyethylene Battery Bin for MGB. We now manufacture approximately 200 products, most of which are in the automotive field. We are located in Michigan.
We specialize in:

Creative product ideas.
Good, simple design
Short run manufacturing (100-5000 annual volume)

We work with most any materials and most any manufacturing methods.
We specialize in lesser-known and proprietary manufacturing methods which allow us to bring low-volume products to market that may not otherwise be financially feasible.
We manufacture primarily in the US, with some items made in Canada and the Far East.

HAPPENINGS




We are excited to introduce the 2017 Clarke Architectural Brochure
Jun 26, 2017
 

We thought it appropriate to provide a brief introduction to our new brochure to point out some of the new products and perhaps most importantly, the Art Deco theme that defines the brochure.
As a company we have had an interest in art deco for several years and decided to emphasize its characteristics in the brochure.  On the cover is our new Deco with Base model.  The tub is one of our most popular and classic shapes.  To this we have added a base structure veneered in Macassar ebony and in the style of Emile Ruhlmann, one of the most noted furniture designers from the Art Deco age.  We introduced this model at the Kitchen and Bath Show last January in Orlando and it was well received.  To enhance the brochure cover we add a background that is quite typical of old Art Deco posters.
On the elegant pages inside of our new brochure you will find our solid surface collection.

Our first tub featured inside of the brochure is the Lotus model. It was inspired by a famous daybed of the Art Deco period that was designed by Eileen Grey, another famed designer.  She created a daybed that she named “pirogue” which is French for canoe.  After seeing the actual product in a museum in Paris, we decided to make our Lotus from the conceptual bones of her Pirogue.   Our legs are different and the sides are much higher but the ends of the tub pay homage to her unique design.
Further in to our brochure you will find our Deco Freestanding which is the tub pictured on the cover page, without the Ruhlmann base.  As you may know, this model is also produced in an acrylic model (Victoria) with a free standing or formed base option.  The deco model has been one of our best sellers over the years; simple, classical and enduring.

On page 12 note that we have added a new and smaller version of our popular Lunar.  The new model is 66 x 32” a full 10” shorter than the original Lunar.  This tub is also featured on page 13 in our Concrete color which is a new addition and available in all Architectural products.

 
The Sparta 66” x 32” center drain, two person solid surface bath is portrayed on page 21 of the brochure.  It can be installed in a frame as shown, or freestanding and can also be under mounted with stone or tile.
In the final pages of our brochure we introduce two new washbasin models that are quite similar yet different.  Specification sheets are available detailing this difference. The Coppa Recessed fits partially into the surface whereas the Countertop version sits on the surface.  Adjacent to the Coppa lavatories, you will find our Diamond shower base in white and the new concrete color.
In conclusion, our new circular soaker the Andaz completes our brochure.  At 51” in diameter and 22” tall, it’s simplicity is pleasant and fresh.
We hope you approve of our new products and we look forward to serving your needs.
