Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

For the day of 07/28/2017

 ""VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE !!! I received my order today and it took 9 days since I ordered and I ordered it on a weekend - so probably it took one week to process. Ray Ban sunglasses are definitely no fake and the prescription glasses are excellent. I will order again - in a store it would have cost me almost 300$ what I got at ezcontactsusa for less than 100$. AMAZING !!!" " 













Sebrina Brown (Bonney Lake, WA)






 "I ordered the Coach HC6013 Eyeglasses Julayne. I received them exactly one week after ordering them. They are PERFECT! They came with the original case, original lenses, and cloth wipe. I couldnt be more pleased with the service and my glasses. I have referred several friends and Im sure this will not be my last order." 













 Dakshesh (New Hampshire )






 "I got the delivery today. It took 7-8 days for shipment after placing the order.. But the wait was worth.. This is same as available in stores, but yes with low price"

If you're looking for hand tufted Asian rugs from China and India, we have several traditional as well as contemporary styles for you to choose from. BuildDirect hand-tufted area rugs have the modern looks you're looking for to bring your interiors to life.




Our roll-up or tri-fold bamboo chair mats. Made from real bamboo, these special area rugs are made to go under your office chair to protect your floor or carpet from the harsh effects of office chair castors. Or how about a traditional bamboo area rug - an easy and inexpensive way to add the beauty of bamboo to your décor.
We also carry natural sisal, sea grass and jute area rugs, neatly bordered with color-coordinated edges and stitching for a rug that lasts and lasts. And what would today's modern living room be without a shag area rug? We stock both bamboo/cotton shags or 100% natural thick pile wool shag in all of the latest colors.
