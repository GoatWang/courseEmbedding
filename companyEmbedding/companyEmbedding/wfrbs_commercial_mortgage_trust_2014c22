Fitch to Rate WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-C22 Pass-Thru Certificates; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-C22 Pass-Thru 
      Certificates; Presale Issued
    





September 02, 2014 02:47 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s 
      WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-C22 Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$57,333,000 Class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$75,863,000 Class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59,936,000 Class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$360,000,000 Class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$386,043,000 Class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$102,144,000 Class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$104,132,000b Class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$1,145,451,000* Class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$68,802,000b Class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52,066,000b Class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$225,000,000b Class PEX 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,611,000*a Class X-C 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$14,876,000*a Class X-D 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$111,570,000a Class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,611,000a Class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$14,876,000a Class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      * Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      a Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEX 
      certificates; and class PEX certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B and C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Aug. 28, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $232,438,000 
      interest-only class X-B, $63,223,793 interest-only class X-E, 
      $29,558,534 interest-only class X-Y, or the $63,223,793 class G.
    

      The certificates represent beneficial ownership in the trust, primary 
      assets of which are 129 loans secured by 172 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.487 billion as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Wells 
      Fargo Bank, National Association, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Rialto 
      Mortgage Finance, LLC, Liberty Island Group I LLC, NCB, FSB, C-III 
      Commercial Mortgage LLC, Basis Real Estate Capital II, LLC, and Walker & 
      Dunlop Commercial Property Funding I WF, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 62.2% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 70.7%, and asset summary reviews on 68.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.47x and 106.2%, 
      respectively, compared with the first-half 2014 averages of 1.19x and 
      105.6%, respectively. However, excluding the co-op properties, the 
      pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.16x and 110.1%, respectively. This 
      represents higher leverage than recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate deals, 
      excluding the 19 loans collateralized by cooperative housing (co-op) 
      properties.
    

      Diverse Pool: The pool is diverse by loan size and sponsor as compared 
      to recent transactions, as evidenced by a loan concentration index (LCI) 
      of 317 and sponsor concentration index (SCI) of 330. Also, the 10 
      largest loans represent 43.6% of the total pool balance, which is lower 
      than the average 2013 top 10 concentration of 54.5% and the first-half 
      of 2014 average of 52.5%.
    

      Single-Tenant Assets: Of the Top 20 loans, there are five loans (9.3% of 
      the pool) that are secured by properties leased to a single tenant. This 
      includes both CSM Bakery Portfolios (4.6%), Preferred Freezer Houston 
      (1.7%), 400 Atlantic (1.7%), and Lincoln Plaza (1.2%).
    

      Limited Amortization: Approximately 17% of the pool is full-term 
      interest-only, and 41.8% of the pool is partial-term interest-only. Four 
      loans within the pool (8.7%) are structured as ARD loans. The remainder 
      of the pool (77 loans, 32.5%) consists of amortizing balloon loans with 
      loan terms of five to 10 years. Based on the scheduled balance at 
      maturity, the pool will have paid down 11.2%.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 7.31% below the 
      most recent NOI (for properties for which a recent NOI was provided, 
      excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). 
      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and could result 
      in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the 
      sensitivity of the ratings assigned to WFRBS 2014-C22 certificates and 
      found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further 
      declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' 
      could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 
      30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 
      'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report includes a detailed 
      explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities on pages 80 - 81.
    

      The master servicers will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and 
      NCB, FSB, rated 'CMS1-' and 'CMS2-', respectively, by Fitch. The special 
      servicers will be CWCapital Asset Management, LLC and NCB, FSB rated 
      'CSS1-' and 'CSS3+', respectively, by Fitch.

Why do we ask for Social Security?



Social Security Number


Why do we ask for your Social Security Number

Freddie Mac takes protecting your privacy seriously. We ask for your Social Security Number (SSN) to help us confirm that the requested information is being given to the mortgage holder or to someone authorized by the mortgage holder to receive the information.
We ask for your SSN because it allows us to quickly and accurately determine if your mortgage is held by Freddie Mac and to deliver an answer to you immediately. Providing a SSN increases the speed and accuracy of the look-up response.
We take measures to protect the SSN that you deliver to us (see below).

How do we handle your SSN after you enter it?

The SSN you enter within this form is only used to answer your specific look-up request. We do not save the number you enter or distribute it to a third party for any other purpose.
All information you enter in this form is transmitted from your web browser to our site via an encrypted communication channel. Please review our privacy policy for more details.

Do you have to provide your SSN number?

No. If you wish, you may submit an email request that does not require your SSN. Our customer service representatives will respond as quickly as they can, but given current demand it may take several days. Please be patient.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Document Custody

Important Updates
November 9, 2016 – Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide (Guide) Bulletin 2016-12 announced revised Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae ARM Notes and Riders and Freddie Mac ARM Notes and Riders that impose a Lifetime Floor equal to the ARM's Margin effective for ARMs with a Note Date on or after October 1, 2016.
As stated in Guide Bulletin 2016-12, there are no new verification elements for Document Custodians to certify ARMs with Lifetime Floors except regarding ARMs originated using Fannie Mae ARM Notes and ARM Riders amended to add a Lifetime Floor.
