If you maintain an account that you access through this Site, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password (or Personal Identification Number or PIN) and for restricting access to your computer. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities occurring under your account or password that are due to your conduct, inaction, or negligence. Notify us immediately if you become aware of any disclosure, loss, theft or unauthorized use of your password.

While certain tools available on the Site may provide general investment or financial analyses based upon your personalized input, such results are not to be construed as our providing investment recommendations or advice. Unless otherwise specified, you alone are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy or any other product or service, is appropriate or suitable for you based on your investment objectives and personal and financial situation. You should consult an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation.

Prohibited Uses and Means of Access
Prohibited Uses. Because all servers have limited capacity and are used by many people, you may not use the Site in any manner that could damage or overburden any Franklin Templeton server, or any network connected to any Franklin Templeton server. You may not use the Site in any manner that would interfere with any other party's use of the Site.
Means of Access. The Site is generally intended to be viewed by a conventional web browser with a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels or greater, such as Microsoft® Internet Explorer® 7.0 or above, Firefox® 3.0 or above, or Safari® 3.0 and above. Although you may use other means to access the Site, be aware that the Site may not appear accurately through other access methods, and you use them only at your own risk. You are responsible for setting the cache settings on your browser to ensure that you are receiving the most recent data. You should not access the Site through devices or services that are designed to provide high-speed, automated, repeated access, unless such devices are approved by us.
Password protected areas. Access to and use of password-protected and/or secure areas of the Site are restricted to authorized users only. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain unauthorized access to such parts of our Site, or to any other protected materials or information, through any means not intentionally made available by us for your specific use. Unauthorized individuals attempting to access, or actually accessing, these areas can be subject to criminal and/or civil prosecution.

Fund Prospectus Offer, Performance, and Investment Risks
Prospectus Offer. For more information on any of our funds offered in your state, contact your registered representative (financial advisor) or download a prospectus, which contains important information about a fund's investment goals, sales charges, expenses and risk considerations. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.
Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc.One Franklin ParkwaySan Mateo, CA 94403-1906
Fund Performance. Investment return and principal value for our Funds will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Mutual funds, annuities and other investment products are not FDIC insured; are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed by, any financial institution; and are subject to risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.
Investment Risks. All of the funds are subject to certain risks. Generally, investments offering potential for higher returns are accompanied by a higher degree of risk.
Stocks and other equities representing an ownership interest in a corporation have historically outperformed other asset classes over the long term but tend to fluctuate more dramatically over the shorter term. Bonds, and other debt obligations, are affected by the creditworthiness of their issuers and changes in interest rates, with prices often declining as interest rates increase. High yield, lower rated ("junk") bonds generally have greater price swings and higher default risks. Foreign investing, especially in developing countries, has additional risks such as currency, market volatility, and political and social instability.
These risks, and other risks that particular funds may be subject to, such as specialized industry sectors or use of complex securities, are discussed in each fund's prospectus.

Privacy, Personal Information Transmission, Unsolicited Communications and Usage Monitoring
Privacy policy. For individual shareholders of our U.S.-based Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series Funds, please see our Privacy Policy for a summary of the non-public personal information that we may collect and maintain about current or former investors; our policy regarding the use of that information; and the measures we take to safeguard the information.

Technically this means that you hereby grant Franklin Templeton a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license to edit, reproduce, disclose, transmit, publish, broadcast, or post your Communications either on the Site or elsewhere with no liability or obligation to you. Franklin Templeton is free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques obtained in your unsolicited Communications for any purpose including, but not limited to, developing and marketing products.

Third Party Content Providers, Sites, Referrals, and Disclaimers
Conditions may apply to third party content. Some of the products, services, content, including advertisements, tools, and information available through the Site may be provided by companies that are not affiliated with Franklin Templeton ("Third Party Content") and their source is clearly identified. In some cases, the Third Party Content may be framed-in on the Franklin Templeton Site or available through a link to a third party site. In the case of Third Party Content, there may be additional restrictions that apply to its use. You should be careful to examine them (for example, in accompanying statements or caveats or their posted terms of use) because they may be more restrictive than the restrictions Franklin Templeton imposes on our own, proprietary Site Content. Third Party Content providers may have reserved a right to modify the restrictions they impose on use of their content without notice. As with our Site's Terms of Use, use of Third Party Content after a change in the posted restrictions relating to that content will constitute acceptance of those changes.
Not responsible for Third Party Content, referrals or links to third parties or third party sites. For informational or educational purposes, or as a service and convenience to you, this Site may provide referral information, Third Party Content or live links to a regulatory agency, non-profit organization, or other unaffiliated third party and their websites, including companies that have a relationship with Franklin Templeton.
Our decision to provide referral information to a third party or to pass on an offer made by a third party vendor or to provide a link from our Site to a third party site is not an endorsement of the third party, their products or services, or their website accessed through any such links. While we would generally only provide such information from, or links to, sources considered reliable, we do not have the resources to conduct independent investigations and accordingly we make no representations or warranties as to third party products, services, content, tools and information, and do not guarantee their accuracy, timeliness, completeness or usefulness. We advise and encourage you to do your own research. You will use Third Party Content only at your own risk.
Although Third Party Content may be displayed, framed-in or provided in a pop-up box on the Site, or available through a live link from our Site to a third party site, Franklin Templeton does not prepare, edit, guarantee or endorse Third Party Content. By clicking on a link from our Site to any third party site, you will leave this Site (even if, for your convenience, a second browser window is opened). When viewing Third Party Content through such a link, keep in mind that the third party's site terms and conditions, privacy and security policies, or other legal information may be different from those of Franklin Templeton's Site. We are not liable for any direct or indirect technical or system issues, consequences, or damages arising from your use of any third party website. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY THIRD PARTY, THEIR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THEIR WEBSITE, OR ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH SUCH THIRD PARTY SITES, NOR DO WE MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THIRD PARTY CONTENT (OR ITS ACCURACY) ON ANY THIRD PARTY SITES, AND WE SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER IN RELATION TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING.

Disclaimers
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. NONE OF FRANKLIN TEMPLETON, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES") GUARANTEES THE TIMELINESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF ANY OF THE SITE. NONE OF THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES WARRANT THAT THIS SITE OR DOWNLOADS WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS, OR BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR FREE OR THAT THIS SITE, ITS SERVER OR ANY FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING THROUGH THIS SITE ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL ELEMENTS. THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIRUSES OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE THAT MAY BE CAUSED TO YOU AS A RESULT OF USING THIS SITE. PERIODS OF VOLATILE OR UNUSUAL MARKET ACTIVITY, IN PARTICULAR, MAY AFFECT SYSTEMS AVAILABILITY OR RESPONSE TIME.
YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS SITE AND THE TIMELINESS, USEFULNESS, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE SITE IS ASSUMED SOLELY BY YOU. ALL OF THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, ENDORSEMENTS, GUARANTEES, OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THIS SITE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, ALL OF THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THIS SITE.
You are responsible for your connectivity. You agree that you are responsible for the means you use to access the Site and understand that your hardware, software, the Internet, your Internet Service Provider, and other third parties involved in connecting you to our Site may not perform as intended or desired.
Not responsible for third party damages. Franklin Templeton also disclaims responsibility for damages third parties may cause to you through the use of this Site, whether intentional or unintentional. For example, you understand that hackers could breach our security procedures, and that Franklin Templeton will not be responsible for any related damages.
No reliance on Data. Reasonable precautions have been taken to ensure that Site Content, including account information and pricing data, are complete and accurate. However, due to the nature of information delivery technology and the necessity of using multiple data sources, including Third Party Content, we are unable to assure the accuracy of the data you access through this Site. Site Content is presented only as of the date published or indicated and may be superseded by subsequent market events or other reasons. Franklin Templeton has no duty to update this Site or any Site Content. WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY ACTIONS OR INVESTMENT DECISIONS TAKEN BY YOU BASED ON THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA PRESENTED THROUGH THIS SITE.
Cautions about future or "forward-looking" statements. Speculation or stated beliefs about future events, such as market and economic conditions, company or security performance, upcoming product offerings or other projections are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve risks and uncertainties. General business, market, economic and political conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we presently anticipate or project.
Internet email. We discourage you from using e-mail for sending confidential or sensitive information. If you send e-mail (encrypted or not) to us over the Internet, you are accepting the associated risks of lack of confidentiality.

Limitation of Liability
YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH YOUR USE OF OUR SITE IS TO STOP USING THE SITE. YOU AGREE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (COLLECTIVELY, THE "EXCLUDED DAMAGES"), ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THIS SITE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LOSS OF REVENUE, TRADING LOSSES, ANTICIPATED PROFITS, BUSINESS, SAVINGS, GOODWILL OR DATA; ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, DENIAL OF SERVICE, ATTACK, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, OPERATOR ERRORS, INCONVENIENCE OR DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OR COMPUTER VIRUS; FAILURE OF ELECTRONIC OR MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT OR COMMUNICATIONS LINES (INCLUDING TELEPHONE, CABLE AND INTERNET);, SEVERE OR EXTRADODINARY WEATHER (INCLUDING FLOOD, EARTHQUAKE, OR OTHER ACT OF GOD); FIRE, WAR, INSURRECTION, TERRORIST ACT, RIOT, LABOR DISPUTE AND OTHER LABOR PROBLEMS, ACCIDENT, EMERGENCY OR ACTION OF GOVERNMENT; OR THIRD PARTY THEFT OF, DESTRUCTION OF, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION, EQUIPMENT OR PROPERTY, EVEN IF THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN THE EXCLUDED DAMAGES. FURTHER, THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY, BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WITH THESE TERMS OR WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS.
THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF: (I) ANY NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF ANY FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTY OR (II) WHETHER THE LIABILITY SOUNDS IN NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LEGAL LIABILITY; AND WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OR EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THOSE STATES, THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES' LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES' AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).

Governing Law, Forum, Severability, and Miscellaneous

            Strategy
        
Quantitative and qualitative analysis is supplemented with on-the-ground research, leveraging the resources of local analysts around the world to identify investment opportunities and risks that a solely U.S.-based manager might miss.
Research efforts focus on rigorous country analysis to identify economic imbalances leading to value opportunities in currencies, interest rates (duration) and sovereign credit.
We continually evaluate risk, shifting the risk budget based on relative attractiveness over the course of global economic and credit cycles.



            Benefits
        
Geographic Diversification. The fund has a diversified portfolio by investing in any country or currency from around the world to find the best values for the portfolio.
Global Platform. Global and local experts provide extensive country analysis through multiple perspectives and lenses.
Experienced Management. Michael Hasenstab has managed the fund since 2001 and is backed by a large and experienced team of analysts around the world.

Derivatives, including currency management strategies, involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses on an amount that exceeds the fund’s initial investment. The fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised.
The markets for particular securities or types of securities are or may become relatively illiquid. Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the security’s value and on the fund’s ability to sell such securities when necessary to meet the fund’s liquidity needs or in response to a specific market event.
Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations (which may be significant over the short term) and economic and political uncertainties; investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors.
Sovereign debt securities are subject to various risks in addition to those relating to debt securities and foreign securities generally, including, but not limited to, the risk that a government entity may be unwilling or unable to pay interest and repay principal on its sovereign debt, or otherwise meet its obligations when due.
Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal.
Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund’s share price may decline.
Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond’s credit rating may affect its value.
These and other risks are discussed in the fund’s prospectus.

Total Returns include change in share price, assume reinvestment of all distributions, and reflect the deduction of fund expenses and applicable fees. Total Returns With Sales Charge: returns reflect the deduction of the stated sales charge. Total returns, distribution rate, and yields reflect any applicable expense reductions, without which the results for those impacted funds would have been lower.
For more information on any of our funds, contact your financial advisor or download a free prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
Most Franklin Templeton funds offer multiple share classes. Share classes are subject to different fees and expenses, which will affect their performance. In general, Class A shares have a maximum initial sales charge; Class C shares have a 1% contingent deferred sales charge; Class Z, Advisor Class and Class R6 shares have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees; Class R shares have no sales charges, but do have a Rule 12b-1 fee.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of the range of a fund's total returns. In general, a higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Based on the fund's monthly returns over the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
The fund's 30-day standardized yield is calculated over a trailing 30-day period using the yield to maturity on bonds and/or the dividends accrued on stocks. It may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate, which reflects the fund's past dividends paid to shareholders.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net Asset Value — The amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day.
Source: Morningstar®. The style box reveals a fund's investment style. For credit quality of the bonds owned, Morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies (only using ratings assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization - "NRSRO") with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weighted-average credit quality is less than BBB-; medium are those less than AA- but greater or equal to BBB-; and high are those of AA- or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; average effective duration between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those at 125% or greater of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. Shaded areas show the past 3 years of quarterly data.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Source: Morningstar®. For each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance, and does not take into account the effects of sales charges, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Rating™ is for the named share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future performance.

A measure of the fund's volatility relative to the market, as represented by the Citigroup World Government Bond Index. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the market. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Percentage of the fund's returns explained by movements in the Citigroup World Government Bond Index. 100 equals perfect correlation to the index. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
The Gross Expense Ratio does not include a fee waiver related to the Fund's investment in a Franklin Templeton money fund and/or other Franklin Templeton fund, contractually guaranteed through 4/30/18. Fund investment results reflect the fee reduction; without this reduction, the results would have been lower. Please see the prospectus for additional information. 
Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin California Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.
