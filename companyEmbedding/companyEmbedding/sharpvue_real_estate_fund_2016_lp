SharpVue Capital Announces Final Closing of its First Real Estate Private Equity Fund
Raleigh, NC – July 18, 2017 – SharpVue Capital, LLC today announced the final close of its first real estate private equity fund, SharpVue Capital Real Estate Fund 2016, LP and its affiliated entities.  The fund raised approximately $72 million in commitments, including an anchor commitment from Medical Mutual Holdings, Inc. The fund makes diversified real estate investments in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, and has so far invested approximately $24 million across four transactions.
“We’re grateful for the strong support of our limited partners,” said Lee H. Roberts, managing director of SharpVue Capital. “We are already building on that momentum with an active investment pipeline.”
Within its target geography, SharpVue invests in all real estate products at all stages of development, and can participate anywhere in the capital structure of a transaction. To date, the fund has invested in four assets:

A mixed-use redevelopment project in Charlotte
A multifamily renovation project in Greensboro
A stabilized retail and office asset in Wilmington
A ground-up hotel development in Nashville

“We did each of these deals on an off-market basis,” added Roberts. “Our ability to do equity, mezzanine, preferred or bridge financing helps us find good situations, and growth in our target markets remains very strong. We’re excited about the investment opportunities ahead for this fund.”
