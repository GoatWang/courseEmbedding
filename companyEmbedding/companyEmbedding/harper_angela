JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREFinding A Way Ahead!: Spiritual Signposts To Healing And Wholenessby Harper, AngelaFinding a Way Ahead! is a book of devotional reflections drawing from experiences of Angela Harper's own healing from a lifelong condition. The reflections are intended to help others, showing that it is necessary to look at various aspects of ourselves in any search for divine healing and wholeness. The notes were originally written for a Time for Healing prayer group; a mix of churchgoers and those who came off the street to join in and who needed someone to talk to, pray with them, and listen. In accessible easy-to-read sections, Angela Harper encourages others to take heart, and to help them find comfort and guidance and coping strategies. Her aim is to give people tools to help turn around their experiences or to see other perspectives.Inspiration & Personal Growth, DevotionalCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 2004 edition. Language: English. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. 144 pages.

Item Description: John Hunt Publishing, United Kingdom, 2016. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. Finding a Way Ahead! is a book of devotional reflections drawing from experiences of Angela Harper s own healing from a lifelong condition. The reflections are intended to help others, showing that it is necessary to look at various aspects of ourselves in any search for divine healing and wholeness. The notes were originally written for a Time for Healing prayer group; a mix of churchgoers and those who came off the street to join in and who needed someone to talk to, pray with them, and listen. In accessible easy-to-read sections, Angela Harper encourages others to take heart, and to help them find comfort and guidance and coping strategies. Her aim is to give people tools to help turn around their experiences or to see other perspectives.  Bookseller Inventory # AAJ9781785354182

    Abundance  2-Day Women's Event Exploring Sufficiency and Generosity of Christ                Come together with women from across the country and all walks of life for ABUNDANCE, a special two-day event to explore the sufficiency and generosity of Christ. Authors and teachers Lisa Harper, Kelly Minter, Lysa TerKeurst, Angela Thomas-Pharr, Jefferson Bethke, Eric Geiger, Linda and Jen Barrick, Jackie Hill Perry, Eric Mason, Lauren Green McAfee, along with Christian recording artists Christy Nockels and Natalie Grant, will explore and illustrate how embracing God's abundance transforms every area of our lives.            Because at ABUNDANCE, we believe that, in Him, little is much, less is more, hardship is blessing, hurt is healed, and wrong is made right. We believe His love multiplies and His mercy is boundless. We know His grace is gratuitous and His forgiveness is excessive. We trust His kindness is generous and His faithfulness overflows. And we remember, in Him our lives can be abundant.    BONUS PACKAGE OPTION - Only $99Get premium seating, a meet & greet with Lisa Harper, and a t-shirt when you select the Bonus Package option when registering for an Abundance event.
