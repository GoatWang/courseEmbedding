Our Team
Symphony’s team consists of experts from a wide variety of backgrounds that come together for close collaboration, execution and innovation.










Dr. Romesh Wadhwani
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
“As I think about entrepreneurship, I have concluded that there is no higher creative calling than being an entrepreneur. More than being a painter, more than being a sculptor, more than being a dancer, more than being a singer… The reason is because entrepreneurs get to create on a very large canvas.”
Read full bio

Dr. Romesh Wadhwani founded Symphony Technology Group in 2002 for one reason: he is passionate about building companies. After a 30-year career as an entrepreneur in the enterprise software sector, Romesh launched STG to lend his expertise and passion to investing.
Before starting STG, Romesh was the founder, chairman and CEO of Aspect Development, Inc. until 1999, when the company was acquired by i2 Technologies. For nearly a decade, Romesh grew Aspect Development into a leader in business-to-business commerce software, which culminated in the merger of Aspect with supply chain software company i2 Technologies. At that time, this combination was one of the largest enterprise software mergers.
Following the merger with i2, Romesh became the vice chairman of i2 and a member of the i2 board of directors until he left to form STG. Before founding Aspect, Romesh was founder, chairman and CEO of Cimflex Teknowledge Corporation, which specialized in products and systems for computer-integrated manufacturing. Romesh received his Bachelor of Science degree from IIT Bombay and his MS and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Carnegie-Mellon University.
In addition to being passionate about entrepreneurship, Romesh is an active philanthropist, having founded The Wadhwani Foundation in 2003. The foundation’s primary mission is to leverage India’s growing human potential to bring about large-scale, high-impact social change.
The Wadhwani Foundation formed its first Entrepreneur Initiative in 2003. Subsequently, Romesh and his colleagues fine-tuned the theory of driving social impact change through economic acceleration. The operational leadership team at the foundation is handpicked from the best talent and cuts across all skill-sets, competencies and diverse experience.  Today, the foundation has expanded into the U.S.  with plans to combine best-in-class workforce development programs and educational technology.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

								Romesh Wadhwani
							

								Chairman and CEO
							






















“As I think about entrepreneurship, I have concluded that there is no higher creative calling than being an entrepreneur. More than being a painter, more than being a sculptor, more than being a dancer, more than being a singer… The reason is because entrepreneurs get to create on a very large canvas.”
Dr. Romesh Wadhwani founded Symphony Technology Group in 2002 for one reason: he is passionate about building companies. After a 30-year career as an entrepreneur in the enterprise software sector, Romesh launched STG to lend his expertise and passion to investing. Before starting STG, Romesh was the founder, chairman and CEO of Aspect Development, Inc. until 1999, when the company was acquired by i2 Technologies. For nearly a decade, Romesh grew Aspect Development into a leader in business-to-business commerce software, which culminated in the merger of Aspect with supply chain software company i2 Technologies.  At that time, this combination was one of the largest enterprise software mergers. Following the merger with i2, Romesh became the vice chairman of i2 and a member of the i2 board of directors until he left to form STG. Before founding Aspect, Romesh was founder, chairman and CEO of Cimflex Teknowledge Corporation, which specialized in products and systems for computer-integrated manufacturing. Romesh received his Bachelor of Science degree from IIT Bombay and his MS and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Carnegie-Mellon University. Romesh currently serves on the boards of directors of multiple STG companies including IRi, MSC Software, Symphony Health Solutions and Symphony Teleca.







								William Chisholm
							

								Managing Director
							






















“We’ve had good success with our companies because we know our target industries and we take the time to really understand and partner with our portfolio companies.”
Bill Chisholm has been a critical member of Symphony Technology Group’s management team since the beginning of the firm. At STG, Bill leads the firm’s investment activities and assumes a hands-on approach in the day-to-day management of STG companies. From strategic discussions to mining innovation opportunities, Bill acts as a sounding board on a variety of issues.

At that time, this combination was one of the largest enterprise software mergers. Following the merger with i2, Romesh became the vice chairman of i2 and a member of the i2 board of directors until he left to form STG.

Pharmaceutical Product Development LLC has closed its buy of Evidera, which was backed by Symphony Technology Group. No financial terms were disclosed. Based in Bethesda, Maryland, Evidera is a provider of evidence-based solutions for the biopharmaceutical industry.
PRESS RELEASE
WILMINGTON, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Pharmaceutical Product Development, LLC (PPD), a leading global contract research organization (CRO), today announced the completion of its acquisition of Evidera, a leading provider of evidence-based solutions to demonstrate the real-world effectiveness and value of biopharmaceutical products.
The acquisition unites two best-in-class research companies, creating transformative opportunities for clients of PPD and Evidera to generate evidence of product value that helps optimize market access for new health technologies. The companies will create a set of seamless services across the drug development continuum that will enhance biopharmaceutical companies’ ability to deliver life-changing therapies to patients.
Operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of PPD, Evidera will continue to be led by its current management team and a seasoned staff of highly credentialed scientific and consulting professionals. Evalytica also will continue to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Evidera, providing both Evidera and PPD clients with an innovative, technology-enabled analytic platform for rapid and transparent analysis of diverse data sources. 





“By leveraging Evidera’s scientific research and consulting capabilities and PPD’s operational excellence in global clinical research, our clients can greatly enhance their ability to navigate today’s complex and fast-evolving R&D and reimbursement landscape,” said David Simmons, chairman and CEO of PPD. “For biopharma companies, our considerable joint expertise will benefit clients in executing comprehensive development strategies for regulatory success, while in parallel collecting the necessary evidence to support discussions with payers and health authorities on pricing and reimbursement. These combined strengths will further support clients in bringing innovative therapies to patients in need.”
Jon Williams, president of Evidera, said: “Demonstrating product value and effectiveness in real-world settings is increasingly critical for the biopharma industry to justify access and reimbursement. Evidence-based value demonstration must be well integrated with, and begin early in, the clinical development process, as payers, health authorities and providers increasingly have set this as a condition for market access. Until today, biopharma companies had limited options for partners with the required expertise. But by marrying a best-in-class CRO with a best-in-class real-world research and market access company, we are providing transformative opportunities for our clients to demonstrate the value of their products.”
Evidera was created as a market-leading independent company under the ownership of Symphony Technology Group (STG) following the acquisition of long-standing health economics, outcomes research, market access, epidemiology and data analytics practices. 





Since it was formed in 2013, Evidera has worked with all of the top biopharma companies, and is a preferred provider for most of the top 50. Evidera scientists and consultants have published more than 2,200 peer-reviewed articles and have more than 1,100 studies in progress across all major therapeutic areas. Evidera will continue to operate its office locations in North America and Europe and grow its network of experts in major markets around the world.
PPD’s acquisition of Evidera closed Sept. 1.
