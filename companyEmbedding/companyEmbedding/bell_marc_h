Marc H Bell's Experience
Title: Chief Executive Officer
               Company: 123jump.com Inc
Job Details
               The Company has been providing pet supplies and products for over 35 years. The Company's products include pet food, supplies, grooming products, toys, novelty items and vitamins, small pets such as fish, birds and other small animals (excluding cats and dogs), and veterinary supplies. The Company's strategy is to offer its customers a complete assortment of pet-related products at competitive prices, with superior levels of customer service at convenient locations. Although services do not represent a significant portion of the Company's net sales, it believes that offering selected pet services better serves the best customers and increases traffic flow in the Company's stores. The Company also offers obedience training in most of its stores, grooming in many of its stores and limited veterinary services, such as routine vaccinations, at a number of stores.  The Company's stores combine the broad merchandise selection and everyday low prices of a pet supply warehouse store with the convenient location and knowledgeable customer service of a neighborhood pet supply store. The Company believes that this combination differentiates its stores and provides it with a competitive advantage. The Company's principal format is a 15,000 square foot superstore, conveniently located near local neighborhood shopping destinations, including supermarkets, bookstores, coffee shops, dry cleaners and video stores, where the Company's target "pet parent" customer makes regular weekly shopping trips. The Company believes that its stores are well positioned, both in terms of product offerings and location, to benefit from favorable long-term demographic trends, a growing pet population and an increasing willingness of pet owners to spend on their pets.  The Company's centralized purchasing and distribution system minimizes the delivered cost of merchandise and maximizes the in-stock position of its stores. The Company currently operates three central and five regional distribution centers. The central distribution centers are located in Mira Loma, California; Dayton, New Jersey; and Joliet, Illinois. Bulk items for all stores are either shipped to regional distribution centers for redistribution or are sent directly to store locations. Manufacturers ship non-bulk supplies to the central distribution facilities which are then distribute either to regional centers or directly to store locations. The Company believes that its centralized distribution system enables its stores to maximize selling space by reducing necessary levels of safety stock carried in each store. The Company also provides order fulfillment services for its Internet customers through its three central distribution centers.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
