Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

ITUS Corp. is latest patent monetizer to expand into product offerings

ITUS Corp. (ITUS), the patent monetization company run by CEO Robert Berman, said it has formed a new subsidiary, Anixa Diagnostics Corp., for the purpose of developing and marketing non-invasive, early cancer screening tests. 
Los Angeles-based ITUS said Anixa will be lead by Dr. Amit Kumar, who will become executive chairman of Anixa, and also assume the role of vice-chairman of ITUS.
ITUS is the second patent monetization company in recent weeks to launch a new unit focused on a commercial business, joining Finjan Holdings Inc. (FNJN), which last week said it had formed a new unit to provide cybersecurity risk advisory service as well as launched a new mobile browser app that helps people detect cyber risks on the Internet.
The move reflects Berman’s effort to expand ITUS’ beyond its high risk monetization business and may boost its earnings power and also may help insulate the company from charges that its infringement litigation campaigns hurt rather than foster innovation.
Patent monetizers, who don’t sell products, have been finding it harder and harder to turn a profit as defendants battle them in the courts. Moreover, large jury verdicts have increasingly been thrown out or limited by appellate courts, who also sometimes have invalidated the patents underlying the cases.
The $30 million award and royalty worth hundreds of millions of dollar Vringo Inc. (VRNG) won from Google Inc. was later overturned and the patents invalidated by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Similarly, $368 million award VirnetX Holdings Corp. (VHC) won against Apple Inc. was thrown out by the Federal Circuit and remanded back to the district court for a reassessment of damages.
The move also will allow ITUS to differentiate itself from patent monetizers who don’t sell products and who are often derisively referred to as patent trolls.
"Dr. Kumar has many years of experience in cancer diagnostics, is a foremost expert in the utilization of cutting edge technolgies for early cancer screening, and has successfully developed and guided several cancer diagnostic tests through the approval process and to the market. With Dr. Kumar's expertise, together with access to other leading scientists and renowned cancer institutes, we currently have the resources that are necessary to bring non-invasive cancer diagnostic tests to market.”
Dr. Kumar has previously worked as an executive, founder and board member of several biotechnology companies. He was president and CEO of CombiMatrix Corp., a developer of genomic diagnostic tests from September 2001 to June 2010.
Since leaving CombiMatrix, Dr. Kumar has been closely evaluating scientific data, and carefully monitoring the advancement of scientific research, in search of technologies that can be used to create highly impactful, cancer screening tests and that are worthy of launching a new company.
ITUS said Anixa has identified two technologies that it intends to use for its first cancer screening tests. The first technology uses a biomarker that has been proven to be effective for the early detection of lung cancer, the number one cause of cancer deaths for men and women. The other technology focuses on biomarkers for the early detection of multiple solid tumors at both early and late stages of cancer. 
Shares of ITUS fell 3.3% or half a cent to 15 cents in over-the-counter trading. They’ve traded between 6 cents and 32 cents over the past year.
The company plans to hold a web-based conference call to present an update on ITUS and its new cancer diagnostic initiative, Anixa. To listen and/or participate in the conference call, dial 877-407-0749 for US & Canada, (412-902-0034 for international callers), or login via the web at http://ituscorp.equisolvewebcast.com/cc-6-24, or access the call via the IR Calendar page, which can also be found on ITUS' website, by clicking the "Investors," "News/Events," and "IR Calendar" links.

- DefinitionTotal of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent. The amount of the economic entity's stockholders' equity attributable to the parent excludes the amount of stockholders' equity which is allocable to that ownership interest in subsidiary equity which is not attributable to the parent (noncontrolling interest, minority interest). This excludes temporary equity and is sometimes called permanent equity.
