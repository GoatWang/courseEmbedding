Why ApolloMD? Solutions for Hospitals
­­
ApolloMD offers leading multispecialty solutions for hospitals through a unique structure focused on excellent clinical operations and enhanced patient care. Emphasizing quality, efficiency, communication, and patient experience, ApolloMD works collaboratively with partner facilities to implement best practices and process improvement across the board.
As the healthcare marketplace grows increasingly complex, hospitals and health systems are turning to trusted partners to ensure the provision of top quality, cost-effective patient care. With a multispecialty focus and national resources, ApolloMD offers scalable solutions for hospitals. Whether a single clinical department, combined services agreement, or multi-facility health system partnership, ApolloMD is committed to delivering outstanding care and streamlined clinical operations in each and every partnership.
Multispecialty Solutions for Hospitals:
ApolloMD partners with hospitals and health systems to provide:

Anesthesia
Emergency Medicine
Hospital Medicine
Intensivist
Palliative Care
Radiology

 ApolloMD offers three key distinctions, resulting in top quality services for partner hospitals.
Physician Ownership
ApolloMD’s status as a privately held, physician-owned practice offers several advantages to hospital partners. With no outside stakeholders, ApolloMD is accountable and responsible solely to hospital clients, partners, and physicians.
Every full-time physician is offered the opportunity to invest in the practice through the Preferred Partnership Program. With no ambiguity regarding eligibility and a guaranteed return on investment, the program offers increased potential return on investment over time. This unique offering supports recruitment and retention efforts, attracting high quality physicians while promoting teamwork and collaboration across all specialties.
Highly Effective Transition Process
 With a strong ability to retain physicians and a highly effective transition process, ApolloMD has successfully transitioned over fifty contracts in the past three years. In order to facilitate the startup process, we have developed a systemized approach to contract transitions, utilizing a 105-point interdepartmental checklist. When awarded a new contract, the transition process is kicked off immediately, with ApolloMD’s dedicated transition team on-site at the hospital within 24-48 hours of an announcement to meet with existing providers.
In addition to a proven contract management process, ApolloMD’s recruitment and retention expertise allows for smooth contract transitions. Our experienced physician recruitment team works closely with local clinical leadership and hospital administration to identify and hire physicians well-suited for each individual facility. We maintain a sizable pool of STRIKE Travel Team members who can provide interim coverage during start-ups and periods of unforeseen staffing shortages.
Physician Alignment
ApolloMD was founded on the idea of physician alignment, and this concept remains a cornerstone of the company today. With compensation based on clinical outcomes and efficiency, our providers are highly motivated to provide top quality patient care.
The ApolloMD Quality Partner Incentive (QPI) Program further incentivizes excellence, with compensation tied to:

Core measure compliance
Clinical and professional quality
Patient, nursing, and medical staff satisfaction
Positive citizenship and collaboration

CareHub: Connected Care from Home to Home
With a depth of experience in optimizing multispecialty clinical operations, ApolloMD developed the CareHub, a suite of solutions for hospitals. The CareHub includes Education, Process Improvements, and Technology tools that can be customized for client hospitals in order to improve patient care.

Apollomd, Inc. Competition

   ApolloMD is a private US group practice owned and operated by its physicians. With more than 1,000 medical directors, doctors, and mid-level practitioners, the group provides clinical outsourcing services focused on anesthesia, emergency medicine, and radiology to high-volume hospitals, surgery centers, and health systems primarily in the Southeast and Midwest. Boasting about a 97% physician retention rate, ApolloMD uses a performance-based compensation model, which pays physicians equitably according to the amount of clinical work they accomplish rather than seniority. Its PaymentsMD division offers health care providers a medical billing and payment collections system that allows patients to pay bills online.
