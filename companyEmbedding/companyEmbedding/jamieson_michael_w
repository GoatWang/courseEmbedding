I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
