To open a new account, please visit any of our convenient branch locations or call our Customer Service Center at 888-588-7000, or apply online for a personal checking, savings or CD. Click here

What is the routing number for First Financial Bank?
The routing number for First Financial Bank is 111301122.

How do I change my name on my accounts?
When your name changes due to marriage, divorce, or other circumstances, we recommend you update all of your account information. Simply drop by any of our convenient branch locations and one of the Personal Bankers will complete the necessary paperwork. Please bring all necessary legal documents to support your name change as well as updated Government issued identification.

How do I re-order Checks?
Simply contact a Personal Banker, or if you prefer, most reorders can be mailed in or placed online.

How do I report a lost or stolen debit card?
Please contact us as soon as possible during business hours at 888-588-7000. After hours or during the weekend, please call 800-528-2273 and follow the prompts. If you are out of the country, please call 812-647-9794. You may also use our mobile app to temporarily disable your debit card.

What do I do if I think my identity has been compromised?
According to the Federal Trade Commission identity theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States. Follow this link to learn more about identity theft and what to do if you are a victim. First Financial’s WOW checking account provides identity theft protection. Click here to learn more.

How do I get a copy of my credit report?
Credit reports and credit scores may affect your mortgage rates, credit card approvals, or even job applications. Reviewing credit reports can help you catch signs of identity theft early. Federal Law allows you to get a free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each credit reporting company. Please visit the link below to request your free credit report at www.annualcreditreport.com.

 

ONLINE BANKING:
ACCOUNT OVERVIEW
Why are some of my account numbers highlighted and marked with an asterisk?
Highlighted account numbers indicate that there is pending transactional activity for the account, often called memo-posted transactions. You can review these pending transactions by going to Account > History for the account.

Can I nickname the accounts on this page?
Yes, you can change the default display name for any account by navigating to the Preferences > Account menu and entering your preferred nickname , or display name for some or all of your accounts. Your chosen nickname will be used instead of the default name or account number throughout the online banking system.

Can I change the display order for my accounts?
Yes, you can change the default display order by navigating to the Preferences > Account menu and entering your preferred account display order. Lower order numbers will be displayed before higher order numbers within each group of accounts (i.e. checking, savings, loan, etc.).

I see a new message link at the top of my Account Overview page. What is this? 
This is how we now notify you of important messages. Click on the message notification and it will take you to the Secure Mailbox. There you will be able to securely read messages from us, as well as send messages to us.

I see a lightning bolt icon located next to my Current Balance. What does this do? 
Placing your cursor over the lightning bolt allows you to make a "Quick Action" transaction. It's a quick way to see balances or transfer funds from one account to another all from the first screen you access.

 

ACCOUNT HISTORY
How do I know how much history is available for an account?
At the bottom of the account history page you can see the oldest historical transaction available for the selected account.

How much history displays by default for an account? Can I change the default amount?
The default amount of history displayed for a selected account is 50 transactions. This default amount, by number of transactions or number of days of history, can be changed for each account under Preferences > Account.

When I export my history, why doesn't the data display on the screen?
This is done intentionally to minimize download time. When you choose to export your data, the time it would take to display the data on the screen is generally unnecessary. If you wish to display the data first, select the 'Display Results' radio button to first show the data, then the 'Export to file' radio button to complete the export.

Why does the running balance disappear when I sort my history?
The running balance is calculated based on your current balance. It then adds and subtracts the items below it working backwards down the list. If you sorted your data by a specific range of dates or transaction type and you are not starting with today's date, the running balance cannot be properly calculated. The running balance is then removed to avoid displaying incorrect information.

How do I view check and other transaction images?
The magnifying glass icon next to some transactions indicates that there is an image stored for that transaction, a check image for example. Just click on the image of the magnifying glass for the specific transaction image you want to view and the system will retrieve the image and display it in a pop-up window. You should configure your pop-up blocker to accept pop-ups from our site to use this feature.

 

ONLINE ACTIVITY
How is the Online Activity page different from Account History?
The Online Activity page contains all transactions initiated via online banking, but does not include transactions made via other means, like ATM or Debit/Credit card transactions. This page also shows the status of each electronic transaction as it moves from a drafted status to approved, then processed.
In contrast, the Account>History page is a record of processed and cleared transactions against your account from all sources, not just online banking. Additionally, account history does not include transactions that have been drafted/approved/cancelled via online banking, but only those that have already cleared or will clear your account.

What is a drafted transaction?
A drafted transaction is one that has been created and saved for later approval. A drafted transaction HAS NOT been transmitted to us for processing, just as a drafted e-mail has not been sent to the intended recipient. This allows you to schedule and draft payments that you, or someone in your household or company, can later approve.

What is a Tracking ID?
The Tracking ID is a unique identifier of each transaction on our system and provides you a way to easily reference a transaction and communicate with our support staff. Please use tracking IDs in any communication to us.

 

FUNDS TRANSFER
How do I transfer funds to a Family Member’s account or an account held at another financial institution?
To transfer funds to another individual’s account, a transfer agreement form must be completed by all parties. You can obtain this form from a Customer Service Representative or you can print it here. Once this form is complete and on file, you will be able to request a transfer by phone.

What is the cutoff time for transfers?
You can make transfers up to 11:59 p.m. on online banking to get same day availability.

If I make a future-dated transfer, when will the transfer be processed and effective?
If you create a future-dated transfer, the transfer will be processed the morning of the effective transfer date.

Where can I see my Funds Transfer activity?
Your funds transfer activity is available in your Online Activity under the Accounts>Online Activity menu. Any drafted, approved, cancelled or processed funds transfers will be displayed. Each transaction has a unique Tracking ID for easy identification.

Can I make my loan payments by initiating a transfer?
Yes, go to funds transfer, pick the account you want to withdraw the funds from, then choose the account that you want your payment to be credited towards.

I can't find my scheduled transfers.
You will need to set up recurring transfers in the new system. Go to Transactions/Funds Transfer to set them up. To see the list of recurring transactions that you've created go to Transactions/Recurring.

 

MANAGING RECURRING TRANSFERS
How do I set up the same transfer to occur every day/week/month?
Go to the Funds Transfer screen and under "Enter Transfer Frequency" change the option from One-Time Transfer to Recurring Transfer. Fill in the appropriate fields.

Can I modify a recurring transaction?
No, recurring transactions may only be created, copied or cancelled. You can also cancel individual occurrences of the transaction under the Accounts > Online Activity menu.

 

STATEMENTS
Will I receive online statements?
Yes, go to Accounts>Statements to view your online account statement. Select the 'Year' and 'Cycle' (statement period) using the drop down boxes. You'll have the option to download and print the statement.

 

SECURE MAILBOX
How do I know if I have a message in my mailbox?
You can logon and navigate to your message mailbox, or there is a convenient link on the Accounts>Overview page to let you know when you have a new message.

Is the content of my message and any attachments sent securely?
Yes, the transport of your message is SSL encrypted and is never sent through public, unsecured communication channels like e-mail communication.

Can I see the messages I have sent?
No, to simplify your mailbox we only show the messages you have received.

How long are messages kept in my mailbox?
Each message is kept for a specified number of days, unless you choose to select a message to never expire. Otherwise, all messages will be saved until the date displayed in the 'Expires on' column in the mailbox.

 

CHANGE OF ADDRESS
How do I change my address?
There are several convenient options for updating your address.
1. Visit any of our Branch locations and meet with a Customer Service Representative.
2. Use the Address Change feature inside Online Banking located under Services
3. Print, complete, and sign the Change of Address Form and mail it to First Financial Bank, Attn: Customer Service, PO Box 701, Abilene, TX 79601

Is my Change of Address request immediate?
No, depending on the number and type of accounts, it may take 3 business days to make the changes.

Will this affect the delivery of my statement and other mail?
Yes, a change of address request affects the account profile, statement, and other mail and correspondence related to the account. Therefore, we may call you for additional verification, if required.

 

STOP PAYMENTS
What is a Stop Payment?
A Stop Payment request is an order by the writer of a check that the payment should not be honored. This may be related to failure by a merchant to provide services, or due to potential fraud-related activity on the account.

How do I stop payment on a check?
There are several ways to place a stop payment on a check.
1. Drop by any of our convenient branch locations and speak with a Personal Banker and they can process the stop payment request.
2. Contact our Call Center at 800-588-7000
3. Go to Online Banking and request the stop payment.

Does a Stop Payment request guarantee that the payment will be stopped?
No, an online request to stop payment on a check does not guarantee that the check will be stopped, as the item may have already been processed and posted to your account.

Can I make a stop payment for multiple checks?
No, at this time you can only make online stop payment requests for individual checks.

 

SECURITY
Do I need a new Login ID and Password for the system?
Initially you will log in to the system with your user ID and temporary password that was provided at account opening or through the automated online enrollment process. After you have logged in, the system will ask you to provide some online contact information under 'Create My Profile'. This information is essential for the Bank to communicate with you. After you create your profile, you will need to select a new password.

Can I reset my password online?
Yes, when you logon check the box marked Forgot Password. Then, choose the option of e-mail, business phone, or cell phone as the delivery method for a secure access code to be delivered to you. As soon as you receive your secure passcode, enter the code, then enter a new password and confirm.

Why would I change my User ID and Password?
It is a good practice to periodically change your password. If you ever believe your User ID and/or password have been compromised, change them immediately.

Why does my contact information appear partially blocked?
The listing of your secure delivery contacts is masked, or partially blocked, when presented online. This is done to prevent possible "over-the-shoulder" viewing of your personal information.

When I login, I’m being asked to "Select Your Secure Access Code Delivery Preference". What is this?
This is part of our Multi Factor Authentication process that is required by Federal regulators. Please select the most convenient way for us to deliver your temporary access code and it will automatically be sent within minutes. You will then be given the option of placing a secure access token on your computer (Eliminating the need to receive a temporary access code to login.)

I already entered my e-mail and telephone number when I first logged on. Why are you asking me for it again on the "Secure Delivery" menu?
The Secure Delivery information is used to send you temporary Secure Access Code. These are used whenever you use our "Forgot Password" function, or when you register your computer for MFA. Up to three e-mail addresses and 3 phone numbers can be entered. When you need to reset your password or register your computer, you can choose one of these phone numbers or e-mail addresses to receive your Secure Access Code.

I get error messages about Cookies or I can't get into the Bill Pay service?
Browsers have settings to control how and when cookies are allowed. Your browser might not be setup correctly. You can use this online tutorial to enable cookies on your browser.

What options do I have on how my online banking accounts are displayed?
Go to the Preferences>Account screen to change your display preferences. Here you can rename your accounts, change the display order of your accounts, and choose the number of history items (or history days) that show on the Account History screen.

 

ALERTS
When are alerts delivered?
When triggered, secure message and e-mail alerts are delivered immediately after all of our transactions have been processed. Phone alerts are delivered at the time you select on any day that the alert is triggered.

Are alerts real-time?
No, alerts are triggered at 6:30am each day. For example, if an alert is triggered during the day on Monday, it will be generated during our 6:30am processing cycle on Tuesday. A secure message or e-mail will be sent immediately after processing, while a phone notification will be sent at the time you selected on Tuesday.

What is the difference in a phone notification versus an e-mail notification?
An e-mail notification, because it is delivered over public e-mail, contains no detail on the alert, only that it has been triggered. On the other hand, a phone notification will provide more detail on the alert.

What if I don't receive a phone alert?
If you miss an alert call, the alert system will leave a voice mail message. If you believe you did not receive a phone call, check your message mailbox under the Services > Messages menu to confirm receipt. If there is no alert in the secure mailbox, confirm that the alert is enabled. If you still believe you did not receive an alert, please contact us at 1.888.588.2623.
NOTE: E-mail and phone alerts are a convenience and should not be used to manage critical account details or appointments, as they are not 100% reliable. On the other hand, secure messages within the online banking system are very reliable.

What if I don't receive an e-mail alert?
If you believe you did not receive an alert e-mail, please check your message mailbox under the Services>Messages menu to confirm receipt. If you received your secure message, but not your e-mail, check your Junk e-mail folder first. If your alert is delivered as junk mail, configure your junk mail settings to allow e-mail from our e-mail address. If there is not an alert in your online secure mailbox, it was not sent. Confirm that the alert is enabled. If you still believe you did not receive an alert, please contact us at 1.888.588.2623.
NOTE: E-mail and phone alerts are a convenience and should not be used to manage critical account details or appointments, as they are not 100% reliable. On the other hand, secure messages sent within the online banking system are very reliable.

Can I disable an alert without deleting it?
Yes, you can edit an alert and uncheck the 'Enable this alert' checkbox to render the alert inactive.

 

NEED ASSISTANCE
