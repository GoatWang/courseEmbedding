  Terms and Conditions Apply. SOFI RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE PRODUCTS AND BENEFITS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. To qualify, a borrower must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident in an eligible state and meet SoFi's underwriting requirements. Not all borrowers receive the lowest rate. To qualify for the lowest rate, you must have a responsible financial history and meet other conditions. If approved, your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including term of loan, a responsible financial history, years of experience, income and other factors. Rates and Terms are subject to change at anytime without notice and are subject to state restrictions. SoFi refinance loans are private loans and do not have the same repayment options that the federal loan program offers such as Income Based Repayment or Income Contingent Repayment or PAYE. Licensed by the Department of Business Oversight under the California Finance Lender Law License No. 6054612. SoFi loans are originated by SoFi Lending Corp., NMLS # 1121636. (www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org)


  ✝ To check the rates and terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score. However, if you choose a product and continue your application, we will request your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies, which is considered a hard credit pull.


  1 At the end of 84 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 7/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  2 At the end of 60 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 5/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  3 SoFi’s interest-only loan is a 30-year, 5/1 ARM loan. During the first 10 interest-only years, the minimum monthly payment required is the interest on the loan. Paying the minimum payment during the interest-only period will not reduce the principal loan balance. At the end of the 10 interest-only years, the minimum payment required will increase, even if the interest rate does not change, to include both interest and principal payments.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Approximately $551 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, June 16, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on seven classes in 
Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-P4, Commercial Mortgage 
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-P4 as follows: 





Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Aug

Cl. X-A, Affirmed Aa1 (sf); previously on Aug 
1, 2016 Definitive Rating Assigned Aa1 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the six P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The rating on the IO class, Class X-A, was affirmed 
based on the credit quality of its referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.2% 
of the current balance. Moody's provides a current list of 
base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION:




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only 
(IO) Securities" published in June 2017. Please see the Rating 
Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this 
methodology.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the June 14, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by less than 1% to 
$718 million from $721 million at securitization. 
The certificates are collateralized by 45 mortgage loans ranging in size 
from less than 1% to 9.7% of the pool, with 
the top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 51% of the 
pool.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 26, 
the same as at securitization.




Two loans, constituting 3% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool and there currently are no 
loans in special servicing.




Moody's received full year 2016 operating results for 75% of the 
pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). Moody's 
weighted average conduit LTV is 117%, compared to 118% 
at securitization. Moody's conduit component excludes loans 
with structured credit assessments, defeased and CTL loans, 
and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's value 
reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 10.0%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.50X and 0.93X, 
respectively, compared to 1.50X and 0.92X at securitization. 
Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's 
actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 24% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Opry Mills Loan ($70.0 million -- 
9.7% of the pool), which is secured by a pari passu 
interest in a $375 million senior mortgage loan. The loan 
is secured by a 1.2 million square foot (SF) super-regional 
mall located in Nashville, Tennessee, and sponsored by Simon 
Property Group, L.P. The property is part of Opryland, 
which includes the Grand Ole Opry and the Gaylord Opryland Resort and 
Convention Center. The convention center, which includes 
2,881 rooms and 600,000 SF of meeting space, has over 
3.0 million visitors each year. The mall is anchored by 
Bass Pro Shops, Regal Cinemas, Dave & Buster's, 
and Forever 21. As of March 2016, the property was 99% 
leased. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 92% and 1.00X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization.




The second largest loan is the Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach Resort & 
Spa Loan ($60.0 million -- 8.4% of the 
pool), which is secured by a pari passu interest in a $200 
million senior mortgage loan. The loan is secured by the borrower's 
fee simple interest in a five building, 517-room, full 
service-hotel located in Huntington Beach, California. 
Hotel amenities include seven dining options comprised of restaurants 
and poolside dining, room service, indoor and outdoor function 
space, three ocean-view ballrooms, retail space, 
two pools, a mini waterpark, a full service spa, a fitness 
center, a business center, and a 990-space subterranean 
parking structure. As of December 31, 2015, the trailing 
twelve-month occupancy rate and revenue per available room (RevPAR) 
were 83.5% and $217.50, respectively. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 119% and 0.95X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization.




The third largest loan is the Esplanade I Loan ($41.0 million 
-- 5.7% of the pool), which is secured by a pari 
passu interest in a $67.5 million senior mortgage loan. 
The loan is secured by the borrower's fee simple interest in a 19-story, 
Class A office building totaling 536,000 SF, and a two-story 
research and development ("R&D") building totaling 73,000 
SF. The subject property is located in Downers Grove, Illinois, 
approximately 23 miles west of the Chicago CBD. Tenant amenities 
include the Esplanade Fitness Center which includes a pool/whirlpool, 
aerobic studio, weight room, racquetball courts, squash 
court and masseuses. As of June 2016, the property was 85% 
occupied by 54 tenants. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 121% 
and 0.87X, respectively, compared to 123% and 
0.86X at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Approximately $553.5 million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, August 01, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service, ("Moody's") has 
assigned definitive ratings to seven classes of CMBS securities, 
issued by Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-P4, Commercial 
Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-P4:




Cl. A-1, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-3, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-4, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-AB, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. X-A*, Definitive Rating Assigned Aa1 (sf)


Cl. A-S, Definitive Rating Assigned Aa3 (sf)




* Reflects interest-only class




RATINGS RATIONALE 




The Certificates are collateralized by 45 fixed rate loans secured by 
64 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and the 
structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.50X is worse than the 2015 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 1.62X but in-line with other conduit/fusion 
transactions rated by Moody's in the second quarter of 2016 (1.56X). 
The Moody's Stressed DSCR of 0.93X is in-line with the 2015 
conduit/fusion transaction average of 0.96X. 




The pooled Trust loan balance of $721.16 represents a Moody's 
LTV ratio of 117.9%,which is worse than the 2015 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 115.8% and worse than/in-line 
with/better than most pools securitized during the second quarter of 2016 
(116.2%). There are five loans in the pool structured 
with additional debt in the form of subordinate debt and mezzanine debt. 
With the additional debt, the Moody's total debt LTV ratio rises 
to 121.0%. 




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity 
when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan level diversity, 
the pool's loan level Herfindahl score is 25.7. The transaction 
loan level diversity profile is worse than Moody's-rated 
transactions 2015 conduit/fusion transaction average of 30.0. 
With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property level 
Herfindahl score is 27.6.




The following notable strengths of the transaction include: (i) 
the low small market composition as the percentage of properties located 
in small markets represent only 14.0% of the pool balance, 
(ii) six loans (12.9% of the pool balance) are secured by 
multiple properties and/or cross collateralized assets and (iii) seventeen 
loans (32.7% of the pool balance) represent acquisition 
financing.




The following notable concerns of the transaction include: (i) the 
high weighted average Moody's LTV ratio of 117.9%, 
(ii) the high concentration of loans with interest-only debt service 
components as seven loans (23.1% of the pool balance) are 
structured with interest-only payment schedules for the entire 
term of the loan and twenty-five loans (49.4% of 
the pool balance) are structured with interest-only periods followed 
by amortization and (iii) five properties (11.7% of the 
pool balance) that are occupied by single tenants.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 0 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.37, which is in-line 
with the 2015 conduit/fusion transaction average of 2.36.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/ Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014 . 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which 
it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement 
levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual 
and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects 
the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). 
Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of 
investment-grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit 
loan that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance.




Moody's analysis also uses the CMBS IO calculator which references 
the following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based on the 
published methodology: original and current bond ratings and credit 
estimates; original and current bond balances grossed up for losses 
for all bonds the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; and 
IO type corresponding to an IO type as defined in the published methodology. 





Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 6.2%, 
15.4%, and 23.8%, the model-indicated 
rating for the currently rated Aaa (sf) classes would be Aaa (sf), 
Aa1 (sf), and Aa3 (sf) , respectively. Parameter Sensitivities 
are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate 
over time; rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation 
of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in 
the initial rating process differed. The analysis assumes that 
the deal has not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the 
ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated 
standpoint. Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration 
in the ratings process, so the actual ratings that would be assigned 
in each case could vary from the information presented in the Parameter 
Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's and (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings: 





The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




Moody's ratings address only the credit risks associated with the 
transaction. Other non-credit risks have not been addressed 
and may have a significant effect on yield to investors.




The ratings do not represent any assessment of (i) the likelihood or frequency 
of prepayment on the mortgage loans, (ii) the allocation of net 
aggregate prepayment interest shortfalls, (iii) whether or to what 
extent prepayment premiums might be received, or (iv) in the case 
of any class of interest-only certificates, the likelihood 
that the holders thereof might not fully recover their investment in the 
event of a rapid rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1035924. 





The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The classes above reflect the final ratings and deal structure.The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the trust, primary assets of which are 45 loans secured by 64 commercial properties having an aggregate principal balance of $721,157,407 as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital, Starwood Mortgage Funding V LLC and Barclays Bank PLC.Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including site inspections on 76.2% of the properties by balance and asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 81.3% of the pool.KEY RATING DRIVERSHigher Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are higher than other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.13x is below the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 average of 1.17x and full-year 2015 average of 1.18x, respectively. The pool's Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 111.1% is above the YTD 2016 and 2015 averages of 107.5% and 109.3%, respectively.Average Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans make up 50.9% of the pool, which is below the YTD 2016 average of 55.4%, but above the 2015 average of 49.3% for other Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) of 389 is below the YTD 2016 average of 428, but above the 2015 average of 367.High Lodging Exposure: Approximately 19.3% of the pool by balance, including six of the top 20 loans, consists of hotel properties. Hotel concentration in the pool is greater than the YTD 2016 and 2015 averages of 15.9% and 17.0%, respectively. Hotels have the highest probability of default in Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.RATING SENSITIVITIESFor this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 16.9% below the most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 2016-P4 certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities on page 10.DUE DILIGENCE USAGEFitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary (RAC).Read MoreAdditional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 18 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=884963Criteria for Analyzing Multiborrower U.S. and Canadian Commercial Mortgage Transactions (pub. 01 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=882237Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=883130Rating Criteria for Structured Finance Servicers (pub. 01 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=884140Rating Criteria for U.S. Commercial Mortgage Servicers (pub. 14 Feb 2014)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=735382U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=873395Related ResearchCitigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-P4 -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=884928Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1009726ABS Due Diligence Form 15E 1https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf15E_frame.cfm?pr_id=1009726&flm_nm=15e_1009726_1.pdfSolicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1009726Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Gire: The "skinny repeal" is not a "modest" change.  By eliminating the need for all to have health insurance, the insurance companies know that costs will spiral out of control.  People who think they are healthy (now) and short on cash will bail.  Sicker people will remain, so costs will go up.  Other people who think they are healthy (now) and who can't afford the higher costs will drop out.  Costs will go up.  

While this affects me (as a self-employed person), you may think it doesn't affect you and your employer-based insurance.  Oops.  With none of the ACA cost constraints, prices will return to 6% or 8% annual increases (increases are currently about 4%).  Your salary will only increase about 2% yearly.  After 10 years your insurance costs will double, while your salary will go up about 25%.  Oops.Join the Conversation1 / 5347

Commercial Financing
If you have never had to deal with commercial real estate financing, you may find it intimidating. That is certainly the case for most first-time commercial borrowers. Commercial real estate mortgages are quite different from their residential cousins in terms of both complexity and cost. But getting the facts before you apply for a loan should eliminate any fears about this fantastic business financing technique.

The Basics of Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial real estate financing is very similar to residential mortgage lending in that real property is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property. A business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns, which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose. Commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest -- commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable -- until the loan is paid in full. Moreover, a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term, with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender. 

What distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower. Unlike residential mortgages, which are geared toward the individual and 1-4 unit residential dwellings, commercial property financing is designed for business entities -- both for profit and not-for-profit -- to mortgage nearly any type of retail, office, industrial, multi-unit (5+) unit residential, or just about any other commercially zoned real property.

Because of these property and borrower characteristics, commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry. The limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena. If a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure, it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house. To compensate for the greater risk, commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements, and loan terms are shorter (typically a maximum of 25/30 years). 

Commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower, but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards, a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firm's principals may be used to compensate. 

A final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close. Not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages, but nearly every aspect of the "due diligence" phase -- from valuation, to title, to underwriting -- is more complicated and, therefore, more costly. 

An Illustration: The "Vanilla" Commercial Mortgage Loan

To help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice, here are the major characteristics of a standard "vanilla" commercial mortgage loan.

Debt Coverage Ratio

Commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower. The lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments. Generally, commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from 1.1 to 1.25 times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income. For example, if the monthly mortgage payment is $2,000, the property should be producing $2,200 to $2,500 after all expenses are paid. 

Down Payment

Commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of 25% down. A higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk, newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability.

Prepayment Penalties

Commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties, that is, a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made. For example, the fee might be 5% of the outstanding balance during the first year, 4% the second year, and so on, with no penalty after the fifth year. For obvious reasons, prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to -- or be able to -- own the property long enough to avoid them.

Although these characteristics illustrate a “standard” in commercial real estate mortgages, you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them. Generally, deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk. For example, an up-front fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty, while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment.
Where to Go For Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the U.S. The three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are:
1. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities2. Regional Banks3. Private Equity Companies - i.e. Life Insurance Companies / Pension Manager / Hedge Funds4. Specialty Finance Companies - i.e. Third-Party ("Conduit") and Hard Money Lenders
Commercial Mortgage Brokers
Naturally, most business owners turn to banks -- particularly ones with whom they have established relationships -- for their commercial real estate financing. On the one hand, banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates; on the other, they are the most rigid in their lending. Many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries. They also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources.

Conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks. Because their money comes from private sources, insurance companies, and commercial lines of credit, they can be much more flexible in their lending. You will find that hard money lenders, in particular, will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers -- all at a cost: Hard Money Lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks.

For larger capital needs, companies often turn to private equity companies. Private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project. The equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide -- normally no more than 75 percent of costs. So, for a $5 million project, commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than $3.8 million, leaving $1.2 million in the equity range for the borrower to fund. If the borrowing entity has $200,000 in cash to put into the project, it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining $1 million. Private Equity Companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative, flexible financing solutions, but they expect a good return on investment, so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders. Commercial mortgage brokers don't fund loans directly. Instead, a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees. A good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs, giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own. As an added benefit, commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging, making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy. Using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in up-front fees, a higher than market interest rate, or both. A good one, though, will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your company's specific needs at a competitive rate.

With so many choices, it is important that you shop around, but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate. As is the case in residential mortgages, commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next. But with such a big financial commitment at stake, unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing, you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan. 

Regardless of the source you ultimately use, a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome.

Preparation: The Key to a Smooth Commercial Mortgage Lending Process

When you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender, some advance preparation will serve you well. The complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to "rate shop" multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone -- at least, not with any reliability. 
Any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information, which is needed to give you an informed, accurate decision about your company's ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect: 1. Year-to-date profit & loss statement and balance sheet 2. Three years business income tax returns 3. Projected cash flow for the next 36 months
4. Personal Financial Statement and Resume for the Principal5. Property information
6. Written business plan
Having these items available will not only make your task easier, it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request. Be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information. You could be in for nasty surprises later!

Commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company. Unlike other types of credit for business, which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period, commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with long-term, asset based financing, at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
