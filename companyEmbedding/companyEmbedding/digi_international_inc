    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Digi International Reports Third Fiscal Quarter 2017 Results




Smart Solutions Highlights Revenue Performance






July 27, 2017 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Digi International® Inc. (NASDAQ: DGII), a leading global provider of 
      machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity 
      products and services, reported revenue of $45.7 million for the third 
      fiscal quarter of 2017 compared to our guidance range of $44.0 million 
      to $47.0 million and to $52.1 million in the third fiscal quarter of 
      2016. Net income for the third fiscal quarter of 2017 was $1.3 million, 
      or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to our guidance range of $0.03 to 
      $0.06 per diluted share and to net income for the third fiscal quarter 
      of 2016 of $4.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. When adjusted for 
      the restructuring charges noted below, as well as discrete tax benefits, 
      adjusted income per diluted share was $0.08 in the third fiscal quarter 
      of 2017.
    


      EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) 
      from Continuing Operations in the third fiscal quarter of 2017 was $2.1 
      million, or 4.7% of total revenue, compared to $5.9 million, or 11.4% of 
      total revenue, in the third fiscal quarter of 2016. EBITDA from 
      Continuing Operations for the third fiscal quarter of 2017 included 
      restructuring charges of $2.5 million. Stock-based compensation expense 
      was $1.2 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2017 compared to $0.9 
      million in the third fiscal quarter of 2016. Stock-based compensation is 
      included in EBITDA. Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP financial 
      measures, including EBITDA from Continuing Operations, appear at the end 
      of this release.
    

      “We continued to see strong sequential growth in our Digi Smart 
      Solutions group and our product business performed as expected for the 
      quarter,” said Ron Konezny, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We 
      were pleased with our profitability performance particularly when 
      considering the $2.5 million of restructuring charges taken in the 
      quarter.”
    

Restructuring


      As disclosed in our Form 8-K filed on June 1, 2017, our Board of 
      Directors approved a restructuring plan. The restructuring plan 
      primarily impacted our France location. In addition, we also eliminated 
      certain employee costs in the U.S. The restructuring is a result of a 
      decision to consolidate our France operations to our Europe, Middle East 
      and Africa ("EMEA") headquarters in Munich. The restructuring charges of 
      $2.5 million, which included $2.3 million of employee costs and $0.2 
      million of contract termination costs, were incurred during the third 
      quarter of fiscal 2017.

      Our cellular product category includes cellular routers and all 
      gateways. The RF product category includes XBee® modules as 
      well as other RF Solutions. The embedded product category includes Digi 
      Connect® and Rabbit® embedded systems on module 
      and single board computers. The network product category, which has the 
      highest concentration of mature products, includes console and serial 
      servers and USB connected products. Our services and solutions offerings 
      include Digi Smart Solutions, wireless design services, the Digi Device 
      Cloud platform and enterprise support services.
    

Total revenue decreased 12.3% to $45.7 million in the third 
      fiscal quarter 2017 from $52.1 million in the third fiscal quarter 2016.
    


        Hardware product revenue decreased by $9.9 million, or 19.6%, in the 
        third fiscal quarter of 2017 compared to the third fiscal quarter of 
        2016. All product categories declined, with the exception of cellular 
        routers and gateways revenue, which was consistent with the same 
        quarter a year ago. Our decline in network product revenue was more 
        than anticipated, as there were significant terminal server sales to 
        large customers in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by an 
        increase in USB connected products revenue during the quarter. 
        Embedded and RF product revenue also declined as we had significant 
        sales to large customers in the prior fiscal quarter. Additionally, 
        embedded products declined due to a decrease of sales of Rabbit® 
        embedded modules, which are in the mature portion of their product 
        life cycle.
      

        Services and solutions revenue increased by $3.5 million, or 220.8%, 
        in the third fiscal quarter of 2017 compared to the comparable quarter 
        in fiscal 2016. The increase was driven primarily by the growth of our 
        Digi Smart Solutions business, which includes $2.4 million of 
        incremental revenue from our recent acquisitions. We acquired SMART 
        Temps on January 9, 2017 and FreshTemp on November 1, 2016.
      


Gross profit was $22.5 million, or 49.2% of revenue in the third 
      fiscal quarter of 2017 compared to $26.0 million, or 49.8% of revenue in 
      the same period of the prior year, a decrease of $3.5 million. Gross 
      profit was negatively impacted by lower hardware product revenue and 
      product mix as the network category, which includes traditionally higher 
      margin products, declined. This was partially offset by an increase in 
      services and solutions gross profit from our Digi Smart Solutions 
      business during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same 
      period in the prior fiscal year.
    

Operating income for the third fiscal quarter of 2017 was $0.7 
      million, or 1.6% of revenue, compared to operating income of $5.1 
      million or 9.8% of revenue, for the third fiscal quarter of 2016, a 
      decrease of $4.4 million. The operating income decline was a result of 
      the decrease in gross profit of $3.5 million, as described above, and an 
      increase in operating expenses of $0.9 million. Operating expenses 
      increased by $0.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared 
      to the same period in the prior fiscal year, which included 
      restructuring charges of $2.5 million, partially offset by lower 
      compensation-related expense.
    

Income from Continuing Operations was $1.3 million in the third 
      fiscal quarter of 2017, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to $4.3 
      million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the third fiscal quarter of 2016.
    

EBITDA from Continuing Operations in the third fiscal quarter of 
      2017 was $2.1 million, or 4.7% of total revenue, compared to $5.9 
      million, or 11.4% of total revenue, in the third fiscal quarter of 2016.

Total revenue decreased 10.5% to $136.5 million in the first nine 
      months of 2017 from $152.6 million in the first nine months of 2016.
    


        Hardware product revenue decreased by $21.9 million, or 14.9%, in the 
        first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to the first nine months of 
        fiscal 2016. This decrease occurred in all product categories, other 
        than cellular routers and gateways, which was consistent with the 
        first nine months of the prior fiscal year. Our decline in network 
        product revenue was more than anticipated as there were significant 
        terminal server sales to large customers in the prior fiscal year, 
        partially offset by an increase in USB connected products revenue. 
        Embedded and RF product revenue also declined as we had significant 
        sales to large customers in the prior fiscal year. Additionally, 
        embedded products declined due to a decrease of sales of Rabbit® 
        embedded modules, which are in the mature portion of their product 
        life cycle.
      

        Services and solutions revenue increased by $5.9 million, or 117.5%, 
        in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to the first nine 
        months of fiscal 2016. This was driven primarily by the growth of our 
        Digi Smart Solutions business. Services and solutions revenue includes 
        $3.9 million of incremental revenue from the acquisitions of SMART 
        Temps and FreshTemp in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. We 
        acquired SMART Temps on January 9, 2017 and FreshTemp on November 1, 
        2016.
      

        Included in revenue performance for the year was a foreign currency 
        translation decrease of $0.6 million when compared to the same period 
        in the prior fiscal year, primarily caused by the weakening of the 
        British Pound and Euro against the U.S. dollar.
      


Gross profit was $65.8 million, or 48.1% of revenue in the first 
      nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to $75.1 million, or 49.2% of 
      revenue for the same period in the prior fiscal year, a decrease of $9.3 
      million. Gross profit was negatively impacted by lower hardware product 
      revenue and product mix during the first nine months of fiscal 2017 
      compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. This was driven by 
      the decline of the network category, which includes traditionally higher 
      margin products compared to our other hardware products, partially 
      offset by an increase in services and solutions gross profit for the 
      first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in the 
      prior fiscal year.
    

Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was 
      $4.6 million, or 3.4% of revenue, as compared to operating income of 
      $12.1 million, or 7.9% of revenue, for the same period in the prior 
      fiscal year, a decrease of $7.5 million. The operating income decline 
      was a result of the decrease in gross profit of $9.3 million, as 
      described above, partially offset by operating expense savings of $1.8 
      million. Operating expense savings were primarily due to lower 
      compensation-related expense, partially offset by the restructuring 
      charges of $2.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, incremental 
      expense for the SMART Temps acquisition of $1.0 million and other M&A 
      expense of $0.8 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we 
      incurred restructuring expenses of $0.7 million pertaining to our 
      corporate staff and related employee termination costs associated with 
      the merging of our Dortmund, Germany office into our Munich, Germany 
      office and contract termination charges associated with the 
      consolidation of our Minneapolis, Minnesota office into our Minnetonka, 
      Minnesota headquarters.
    

Income from Continuing Operations was $5.0 million in the first 
      nine months of fiscal 2017, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $9.6 
      million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the first nine months of fiscal 
      2016.
    

Income from Discontinued Operations, after income taxes had no 
      activity in fiscal 2017, but was $3.2 million in the first nine months 
      of fiscal 2016, or $0.12 per diluted share resulting from the sale of 
      the Etherios business in October 2015 to West Monroe Partners.
    

EBITDA from Continuing Operations in the first nine months of 
      fiscal 2017 was $8.9 million, or 6.5% of total revenue, compared to 
      $15.1 million, or 9.9% of total revenue, in the first nine months of 
      fiscal 2016. Stock compensation expense included in our EBITDA from 
      continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 and 2016 
      was $3.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively.

        Rite Aid Corporation added 3,150 SMART Guards with glycol probes to 
        their front-of-store food service operations. This initial push 
        equipped more than 600 stores with equipment needed to monitor 
        perishable items, including Reach-In and Open Air Linear Cases.
      

        Minnesota Children’s Hospital deployed 625 SMART Guards to their two 
        hospitals and off-site physician group. SMART Temps is monitoring lab 
        samples, pharmacy medications and vaccinations, cryogenics and 
        environmental humidity and temperature readings.
      

        A pharmacy management services provider installed over 300 SMART 
        Guards at over 90 pharmacy sites to monitor their medication and 
        vaccination storage.
      

        In May, SMART Temps was selected as the preferred vendor for one of 
        the top purchasing groups for hospitals across the country. This 
        agreement makes the SMART Temps a preferred solution for over 3,750 
        hospitals and 130,000 healthcare providers.
      

        UCLA selected SMART Temps to monitor one of the country’s most 
        prestigious college and university food service programs that serves 
        over one million meals per year.
      

        Digi International was awarded a SMART Temps contract with the Dallas 
        Independent School District, one of the largest school districts in 
        the country.
      

        A grocery retailer awarded SafeTemps with a contract for 26 of its 
        grocery market locations, which will include over 3,000 sensors and 
        gateways managing food safety.
      

        VersaCold, one of Canada’s largest supply chain companies, selected 
        SafeTemps to monitor approximately 200 trucks and 20 warehouses.
      


PRODUCTS



        The new Digi TransPort® LR54 router was selected for upgrading 
        telecommunications infrastructure in at least 122 weather forecast 
        offices used to disseminate weather content to over 1,000 very high 
        frequency (VHF) transmitter sites - including the equipment monitoring 
        and control systems at the VHF sites. Digi TransPort LR54 routers 
        incorporate a FIPS 140-2 cryptographic module with key cybersecurity 
        and LTE Advanced (CAT 6) cellular features, along with support for 
        multiple wireless standards, carriers and channels.
      

        A major southwestern U.S. city has initiated deployment of the Digi 
        TransPort WR44R for a new traffic control communications network that 
        will connect traffic equipment to a central system so that signals can 
        be operated in real-time. This will reduce congestion and delays by 
        transmitting live intersection video to help detect unusual traffic 
        situations.
      

        Grupo Dragón, one of the largest electric renewable energy generators 
        in Mexico, has chosen Digi TransPort routers to manage telemetry data 
        for their load management system. Grupo Dragón selected us because of 
        the security, reliability and dedicated support of our products.
      

        A South African customer is ramping up production of its BIMS 
        (Biometric Identity Management System) for a voter verification 
        project. The customer remarked that they could not have achieved their 
        technology objectives without Digi ConnectCore® 6UL and the support of 
        the Digi Technical Team.
      

        A major system integrator in Shanghai selected Digi Transport WR21 
        extended-temperature 4G routers for traffic flow monitoring and signal 
        control in an eastern Chinese city with total demand of over 
        500 routers.
      

        A state health authority in Australia has selected and deployed more 
        than 400 Connect ES 8 and more than 500 Digi Remote Manager® licenses 
        to manage ICU equipment.

Forward-Looking Statements


This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based 
      on management’s current expectations and assumptions. These 
      statements often can be identified by the use of forward-looking 
      terminology such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "looking 
      forward," "may," "will," "expect," "plan," "project," "should," or 
      "continue" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or 
      similar terminology. Among other items, these statements relate 
      to expectations of the business environment in which the company 
      operates, projections of future performance, perceived marketplace 
      opportunities and statements regarding our mission and vision. Such 
      statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain 
      risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Among others, these include 
      risks related to the highly competitive market in which our company 
      operates, rapid changes in technologies that may displace products sold 
      by us, declining prices of networking products, our reliance on 
      distributors and other third parties to sell our products, delays in 
      product development efforts, uncertainty in user acceptance of our 
      products, the ability to integrate our products and services with those 
      of other parties in a commercially accepted manner, potential 
      liabilities that can arise if any of our products have design or 
      manufacturing defects, our ability to defend or settle satisfactorily 
      any litigation, uncertainty in global economic conditions and economic 
      conditions within particular regions of the world which could negatively 
      affect product demand and the financial solvency of customers and 
      suppliers, the impact of natural disasters and other events beyond our 
      control that could negatively impact our supply chain and customers, 
      potential unintended consequences associated with restructuring or other 
      similar business initiatives that may impact our ability to retain 
      important employees, the ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and 
      synergies associated with acquisitions or divestitures, and changes in 
      our level of revenue or profitability which can fluctuate for many 
      reasons beyond our control. These and other risks, uncertainties 
      and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the 
      United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including without 
      limitation, our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 
      30, 2016 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other 
      filings, could cause the company's future results to differ materially 
      from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on 
      our behalf. Many of such factors are beyond our ability to 
      control or predict. These forward-looking statements speak only 
      as of the date for which they are made. We disclaim any intent or 
      obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result 
      of new information, future events or otherwise.


Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


This release includes adjusted income from continuing operations, 
      adjusted income per diluted share from continuing operations, and EBITDA 
      from continuing operations, each of which is a non-GAAP measure.


We understand that there are material limitations on the use of 
      non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for GAAP 
      measures, such as net income, for the purpose of analyzing financial 
      performance. The disclosure of these measures does not reflect 
      all charges and gains that were actually recognized by the company. These 
      non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for 
      measures prepared in accordance with, generally accepted accounting 
      principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other 
      companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on 
      any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We 
      believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not 
      reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as 
      determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only 
      be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the 
      corresponding GAAP measures. Additionally, we understand that 
      EBITDA from continuing operations does not reflect our cash 
      expenditures, the cash requirements for the replacement of depreciated 
      and amortized assets, or changes in or cash requirements for our working 
      capital needs.


We believe that providing historical and adjusted income and income 
      per diluted share from continuing operations, respectively, exclusive of 
      such items as reversals of tax reserves, discrete tax benefits and 
      restructuring permits investors to compare results with prior periods 
      that did not include these items. Management uses the 
      aforementioned non-GAAP measures to monitor and evaluate ongoing 
      operating results and trends and to gain an understanding of our 
      comparative operating performance. In addition, certain of our 
      stockholders have expressed an interest in seeing financial performance 
      measures exclusive of the impact of matters such as the impact of 
      decisions related to taxes and restructuring, which while important, are 
      not central to the core operations of our business. Additionally, 
      management believes that the presentation of EBITDA from continuing 
      operations as a percentage of revenue is useful because it provides a 
      reliable and consistent approach to measuring our performance from year 
      to year and in assessing our performance against that of other companies.
We believe this information helps compare operating results and 
      corporate performance exclusive of the impact of our capital structure 
      and the method by which assets were acquired. EBITDA from 
      continuing operations is used as an internal metric for executive 
      compensation, as well as incentive compensation for the broader employee 
      base, and it is monitored quarterly for these purposes.
