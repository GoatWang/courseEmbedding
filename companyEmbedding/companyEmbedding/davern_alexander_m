Alex Davern
President and CEO




As chief executive officer and a member of the National Instruments Board of Directors, Alex Davern is responsible for driving NI’s overall vision and operational execution. With more than two decades of experience at NI, Davern has been instrumental in establishing NI’s brand and business model as a public company, delivering sustained growth and profitability while maintaining the company’s long-term investment philosophy, strategically investing in R&D, and expanding the company’s sales, marketing, and service offering around the world.
Davern is only the second CEO to lead the company since its founding in 1976. He began his career at NI in 1994, and has been part of the Executive Management team since 1997, when he was appointed chief financial officer. During his tenure as CFO, he oversaw a more than 12X increase in the company’s market value. Davern served as NI’s chief operating officer from 2010 through 2016.
Davern has been deeply entrenched in business and platform strategy for the last 15 years. While leading the sales organization from 2010 to 2013, he delivered 73 percent revenue growth and drove the expansion of NI’s geographic footprint in Asia and the developing world. He also served as the executive sponsor responsible for ensuring the successful expansion and ongoing success of some of NI’s largest customers. He has led the company through more than 20 acquisitions, most recently with a focus on expanding the company’s penetration within RF.
In January 2017, Davern was appointed chief executive officer. He is responsible for balancing the company’s long-term vision with short-term business needs to create value for its customers, employees, partners, and shareholders.
Davern holds a bachelor’s degree in commerce and a postgraduate diploma in professional accounting from University College Dublin.
