 Elect James Blair         Bringing Sanity to Local Government    HomeMeet JamesWhat’s ImportantVolunteerDonateHomeA Fresh Perspectivefor YelmLet's make our town safe for families,Friendly for BusinessJoin the Cause  FAMILYJames Blair is 28 years old. Born in La Mirada, CA. He moved to Washington in 1999 and has called Western Washington home ever since. In 2007 his son, Brendon, was born. In August 2015, James married his childhood friend, Melissa. The two have built a life together here in Washington, their first home was in Tacoma. They moved to Yelm in April 2016 and fell in love with the city. They have found their permanent home, and look forward to many more years of being a part of this community. James believes in family first. Our community in Yelm is like a family, and he will always put the best interests of that family first. WORKJames has a background in manufacturing and transportation. Working in manufacturing taught him to appreciate the hard work that goes into building a finished product. While working in the transportation business, there is a very important lesson James learned. To respect the trust given to you to transport other's property to its destination damage-free. Working in these fields has taught him the values necessary to make a great Councilman. To have respect for the legislative process in order to uphold the best interests of the city, and to be responsible with tax revenues. He will prioritize necessary Government functions and stand up against wasteful spending. Government's primary role is to protect Life, Liberty, and Property. He will work to focus Government on those responsibilities.   What's Important To JamesPUBLIC SAFETY Public Safety is one of the essential roles of Government. Currently, our police department is understaffed and underfunded. The fact that there is ever a time when only one police officer is on duty is a danger to both the public and the officer. This is unacceptable. James will be a strong advocate for the Police Department and work for proper funding and staffing.BUSINESS James believes we need to make Yelm more welcoming to business. There are so many empty store fronts. We need to attract quality jobs to Yelm. Completing the bypass is the first step. In order to attract industry, we must improve our infrastructure. These are the jobs that will improve the quality of life for the people of Yelm. James will work to remove harmful regulations and red tape that make it difficult for businesses to come to Yelm.PERSONAL LIBERTY & PROPERTY RIGHTS James fully believes in the freedom of individuals and their property. He will stand up against any legislation that would infringe on the liberty of the people of Yelm. He also believes that property owners should have full say in what is done with their property. He will stand against any infringement on such rights. James does not feel it is the role of Government to dictate the actions of peaceful people nor what an owner can or cannot do with their property.HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING One of the largest contributors to homelessness is the rising rent prices. In order to make housing affordable, supply must outpace demand. Land use laws, property taxes, and zoning regulations all contribute to limiting housing supply and directly result in increased rent prices. We need to review these regulations, scale back and repeal as necessary to open the market. Higher supply and lower taxes will bring housing costs down.Further taxing those who are just getting by will only increase the number of people living in poverty. As for providing transitional housing, there are many companies and non-profits willing and able to help build and provide these services through private donations. We need to eliminate overreaching rules and regulations that inhibit their efforts.   Join the CauseJames' interest in politics has come from witnessing the constant abuses of power in Government today. For far too long, Government has run rapant and unchecked. Individual's rights have slowly been eroded over the years. He has decided to be one to stand up against these actions. However, we can only do this with YOUR help.
