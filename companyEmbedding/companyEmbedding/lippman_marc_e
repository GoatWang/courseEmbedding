Current Research

Despite great strides in treatment for localized breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer remains an overwhelmingly lethal disease. Most breast cancer research has focused on breast cancer cells themselves to identify mechanisms of disease progression. 
The behavior and characteristics of non-cancer cells of the breast, either caused by the presence of breast cancer or influenced by pre-existing risk factors such as obesity and depression, contribute directly to breast cancer progression and malignant spread. Through support from BCRF, Dr. Lippman and his team have made progress toward identifying contributing  host/environmental factors by developing models to study the role of specific genes in breast cancer metastasis. 
The combination of a receptor called RAGE and its binding partner (S100A8/A9) is overexpressed in breast cancer, and Dr. Lippman's group identified S100A8 as a potential biomarker for risk of metastasis. They designed a drug that targets RAGE and observed that this drug prevents breast cancer metastasis in experimental models. They are now using sophisticated pharmacological and genetic methods to manipulate RAGE signaling in breast cancer cells, in cancer-associated fibroblasts, and in other non-cancer cells of the tumor microenvironment. 
They are also working to identify factors in addition to RAGE that are responsible for recruiting and activating myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which impair immune function, allowing breast cancer cells to grow and divide. They will determine if targeting these factors with a drug can block recruitment/activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and prevent breast cancer metastasis. Finally, they are determining if RAGE is a critical factor that enables cancer-associated fibroblasts to drive metastasis of breast cancer cells. 
These research efforts may yield actionable biomarkers and will lead to the development of novel weapons to add to the arsenal against breast cancer.

Marc Lippman, M.D., Publishes New England Journal of Medicine Editorial on Breast Cancer Study
A new approach for monitoring metastatic breast cancer has “remarkable potential,” according to Marc Lippman, M.D., the Kathleen and Stanley Glaser Professor of Medicine and Deputy Director of the University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.
In an editorial titled “Circulating Tumor DNA – Ready for Prime Time?” and published March 28  in the New England Journal of Medicine, Lippman and co-author Kent Osborne, M.D., of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, note the significance of a United Kingdom breast cancer study reported in the same issue.
“Multiple aspects of the management of metastatic breast cancer need improvement,” Lippman says in the column. “Patients are anxious about their risk of recurrence and disappointed at the lack of reliable tests for early detection of recurrence.”
The UK study, “Analysis of Circulating Tumor DNA to Monitor Metastatic Breast Cancer,” by Sarah-Jane Dawson, F.R.A.C.P., Ph.D., Department of Oncology, University of Cambridge, and 17 co-authors, looked at cancer tumor cells circulating in 30 women with metastatic breast cancer who were receiving systemic therapy. The researchers used genetic sequencing to identify DNA alterations and were successful in detecting mutations in 29 of the 30 women. 
In the editorial, Lippman said the study demonstrated that when mutations could be detected in a patient’s primary tumor and in the blood plasma, the number of copies of circulating tumor DNA was reasonably correlated with the patient’s responses to treatment. In other words, there was a significant relationship between the number of DNA copies in blood and the ultimate prognosis of the patient. 
However, Lippman noted that while mutations could be detected in nearly all study participants, the specific structural variations could only be tracked in about 60 percent of the women. Therefore, it may be difficult and costly to develop specific tests for individual patients. 
“Despite these concerns, there is remarkable potential for this approach,” Lippman said in the editorial. Tests of circulating tumor DNA might be able to identify patients who would not need further therapy, or those with localized breast cancer who would be adequately treated by lumpectomy, a partial breast removal. Circulating tumor DNA tests might also be used to screen for recurrences in patients with previously diagnosed early-stage disease, although this potential use has not been proven to improve patient outcomes.
“The new study provides proof of the concept that circulating tumor DNA represents a sensitive biomarker of tumor burden,” said Lippman, adding that “further studies are clearly warranted.”
Board-certified in hematology/oncology, internal medicine, and endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism, Lippman is widely known for his research in breast cancer. In his illustrious career, he has received numerous awards, including the Mallinckrodt Award of the Clinical Radioassay Society in 1978; the Commendation Medal, USPHS in 1982; Meritorius Service Medal, USPHS in 1987; Clinical Investigator Award, American Federation for Clinical Research in 1985; D.R. Edwards Lecture and Medal, Tenovus Institute, Wales 1985; Plenary Lecturer, British Association of Cancer Research in 1987; and the Gosse Lecture, Dalhuosie University, Halifax Nova Scotia in 1987.

Chapter 90. Breast Cancer




Marc E. Lippman










++
Breast cancer is a malignant proliferation of epithelial cells lining the ducts or lobules of the breast. In the year 2010, about 180,000 cases of invasive breast cancer and 40,000 deaths will occur in the United States. In addition, about 2000 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Epithelial malignancies of the breast are the most common cause of cancer in women (excluding skin cancer), accounting for about one-third of all cancer in women. As a result of improved treatment and earlier detection, mortality rate from breast cancer has begun to decrease very substantially in the United States. This chapter will not consider rare malignancies presenting in the breast, such as sarcomas and lymphomas, but will focus on the epithelial cancers. Human breast cancer is a clonal disease; a single transformed cell—the product of a series of somatic (acquired) or germ-line mutations—is eventually able to express full malignant potential. Thus, breast cancer may exist for a long period as either a noninvasive disease or an invasive but nonmetastatic disease. These facts have significant clinical ramifications.
++
Not more than 10% of human breast cancers can be linked directly to germ-line mutations. Several genes have been implicated in familial cases. The Li-Fraumeni syndrome is characterized by inherited mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, which lead to an increased incidence of breast cancer, osteogenic sarcomas, and other malignancies. Inherited mutations in PTEN have also been reported in breast cancer.
++
Another tumor-suppressor gene, BRCA-1, has been identified at the chromosomal locus 17q21; this gene encodes a zinc finger protein, and the product therefore may function as a transcription factor. The gene appears to be involved in gene repair. Women who inherit a mutated allele of this gene from either parent have at least a 60–80% lifetime chance of developing breast cancer and about a 33% chance of developing ovarian cancer. The risk is higher among women born after 1940, presumably due to promotional effects of hormonal factors. Men who carry a mutant allele of the gene have an increased incidence of prostate cancer and breast cancer. A fourth gene, termed BRCA-2, which has been localized to chromosome 13q12, is also associated with an increased incidence of breast cancer in men and women.
++
Germ-line mutations in BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 can be readily detected; patients with these mutations can be counseled appropriately. All women with strong family histories for breast cancer should be referred to genetic screening programs, particularly women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent who have a high likelihood of a specific BRCA-1 mutation (substitution of adenine for guanine at position 185).
++
Even more important than the role these genes play in inherited forms of breast cancer may be their role in sporadic breast cancer. A p53 mutation is present in nearly 40% of human breast cancers as an acquired defect. Acquired mutations in PTEN occur in about 10% of the cases. BRCA-1 mutation in sporadic primary breast cancer ...
