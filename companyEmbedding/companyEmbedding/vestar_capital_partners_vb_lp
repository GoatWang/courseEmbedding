KKR, Vestar and Centerview Enter into Agreement to Acquire Del Monte FoodsSAN FRANCISCO, Nov 25, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE)
Del Monte Foods Company (NYSE: DLM) and an investor group led by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. ("KKR"), Vestar Capital Partners ("Vestar") and Centerview Partners ("Centerview") - collectively the "Sponsors"- today announced that they have signed a definitive agreement under which the Sponsors will acquire Del Monte for $19.00 per share in cash. 
The transaction, which was unanimously approved by Del Monte's board of directors, is valued at approximately $5.3 billion, including the assumption of approximately $1.3 billion in net debt. This price represents a premium of approximately 40 percent over Del Monte's average closing share price during the past three months prior to November 18, 2010, when market rumors of a transaction began, and is also higher than any price the Company's stock has ever achieved. 
"This transaction delivers substantial shareholder value and is a clear endorsement of Del Monte's strategic success and effective execution. The hard work and dedication of our talented team has helped to transform Del Monte from a $1 billion consumer foods business into a branded pet and consumer products company with more than $3.7 billion in revenues," said Richard G. Wolford, Chairman and CEO of Del Monte Foods. "This transaction will enable our Company to continue to successfully grow, building on the foundation our team has put into place. We are excited about the ability to deliver substantial returns to our shareholders, as well as great prospects for Del Monte employees, customers and consumers." 
Simon Brown, Member of KKR and head of the firm's North American Consumer practice, stated, "Del Monte has a first-rate brand portfolio and excellent reputation for providing high quality and nutritious products to families and their pets. We look forward to working with the Company's talented employees and investing in the business as we continue to execute upon Del Monte's proven strategy for growth. Del Monte is a great company, with an excellent strategy, a talented team and a strong future." 
Brian Ratzan, Managing Director and head of Vestar's Consumer group said, "Del Monte Foods is a terrific company with iconic consumer and pet brands. Storied consumer franchises like Del Monte's - with great brands in growing categories - will continue to thrive through investments in innovation and marketing. Vestar looks forward to working with the Del Monte team and our strategic partners to achieve the Company's next phase of growth." 
"Over the last decade, Rick and the entire Del Monte team have built a unique platform based on powerful brands," said Jim Kilts, Centerview's co-founder and former CEO of Kraft, Nabisco and Gillette. "We are truly excited to partner with Del Monte as the Company continues to build on its rich heritage of delivering high quality products to consumers at attractive prices." 
Del Monte plans to maintain a corporate presence in both the San Francisco Bay Area and Pittsburgh, with its corporate headquarters continuing to be located in San Francisco. 
Barclays Capital Inc. served as financial advisor to Del Monte Foods and provided a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction. Perella Weinberg Partners LP also provided a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction. Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP served as legal advisor to the Company in connection with this transaction. 
Centerview Partners acted as lead financial advisor to the Sponsors in this transaction. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan Securities and Morgan Stanley also advised on this transaction. The Sponsors' lead legal advisor was Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. 
The Sponsors have secured committed debt financing from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital Inc., JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and KKR Capital Markets LLC. The agreement permits Del Monte to solicit alternative proposals from third parties through January 8, 2011. The Del Monte Foods board of directors, with the assistance of its advisors, will actively solicit acquisition proposals during this period. There can be no assurance this process will result in a higher offer. If there is not a superior offer, the transaction is expected to close by the end of March 2011, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals. Del Monte does not intend to disclose developments with respect to the solicitation process unless and until the Board has made a decision. 
Del Monte also announced today that it will no longer host a conference call/webcast to discuss its fiscal 2011 second quarter results on Thursday, December 2, 2010.

Vestar offloads detergent business Sun Products

By Jack Hammond -  June 27, 2016 106 






US private equity firm Vestar Capital Partners has agreed to sell laundry-detergents maker Sun Products in a $3.6bn deal, including debt.
The firm has offloaded the business to German consumer products group Henkel, nine years after its initial investment.
Vestar, which invested a total of $450m of equity in Sun in 2007 and 2008, will score more than a 100 per cent profit in the sale according a statement on its website.
Sun Products manufactures a line of private-label and branded fabric care products, including All, Wisk, Surf, Snuggle, Sun and Sunlight.
The company, which also develops and manufactures laundry and dish care brands, generated sales of approximately $1.6bn in the US and Canada for the fiscal 2015.
Henkel said the business will enable it to scale to take on Procter & Gamble Co. in the US detergents market.
With Sun on board, the German company said it will become the second largest supplier in North America for laundry-care products.
Vestar founder and CEO Dan O’Connell said, “We are proud of the company’s many achievements under our ownership, including improved profitability, healthier core brands and strengthened operations and believe the combination with Henkel’s North America business will create a strong platform for future success.”

Harvest Partners Structured Capital Invests in Vestar-owned Roland Foods








        January 9, 2017
      

        NEW YORK, NY - January 9, 2017 - Vestar Capital Partners ('Vestar'), a leading U.S. middle-market private equity firm, and Harvest Partners SCF, LP ('HP SCF'), the non-control private equity strategy of Harvest Partners, LP, announced today that HP SCF has led a $125 million recapitalization and minority investment in Roland Foods ('Roland'), a Vestar portfolio company and leading provider of superior quality specialty foods.  Following the completion of the transaction, Vestar will remain the majority shareholder in Roland and HP SCF will gain board representation. Additional terms of the HP SCF investment were not disclosed.
      

        Founded in 1934 and owned by Vestar since 2013, Roland Foods is a recognized leader in the imported specialty foods business in the U.S. and around the globe. The Roland brand is iconic and stands at the forefront of the industry, providing more than 1,500 SKUs to the foodservice, retail, and industrial channels.
      

        'The HP SCF team is a great addition to our investor group and will be excellent partners,' said Brian O'Connor, managing director of Vestar and co-head of its Consumer Group. 'Roland has achieved extraordinary growth since 2013, and HP SCF will help to accelerate this already strong momentum.'
      

        'Given the strong prospects ahead for our business, both organically and through acquisitions, this transaction is an opportunity to provide Roland with the capital flexibility to further our market-leading position,' said Jim Wagner, Roland's CEO. 'With the ongoing support of Vestar and our new partners at HP SCF, we will continue to grow and provide exceptional service, value and quality to all of our customers.'
      

        Jay Hegenbart, senior managing director and portfolio manager for HP SCF, said, 'We are delighted to join Vestar as an investor in Roland, and to have the opportunity to work alongside Jim and his extremely talented management team. We look forward to supporting the next phase of Roland's growth.'
      

        Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as financial advisor to Vestar and Kirkland & Ellis LLP served as legal counsel.  William Blair & Company, LLC acted as a financial advisor to HP SCF and Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal counsel.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
