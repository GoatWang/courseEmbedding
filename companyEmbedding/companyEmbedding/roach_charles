Families Feel It The Worse


We Understand What Your Going Through


After a roach infestation, you will most likely notice skin irritations, rashes, and cockroach bites making you feel self conscious when in public. Even worse, restless nights and insomnia which now affects your personal life, causing anxiousness and nervousness.


We Witness First Hand Families & Businesses Affected By Roaches












While you may see one or two roaches or other insects. Your family and children will feel them the worse. The roaches migrate to food, counter tops, eating areas and can transport disease.


Being Forced To Evacuate


Insomnia and Feeling Self Conscious


When the infestation is left untreated, you will be told to throw away all your valuables, your clothes, countertops, furniture, bedding, etc. Then after all this, you would be asked to politely evacuate and you or a company would use toxic pesticides having you, your family, and your pets feeling homeless for at least 4 weeks.

Evacuation & $500 Repeat Services Is Why Roach Bully Is A Popular Alternative To Extermination

We Work With Professionals





We have a huge respect for pest professionals and work very closely with well know companies, especially after the EPA has warned about select hazardous chemicals in pest control projects. We also love recommending our pest control companies to any of our customers who choose to try a professional.But the fact is… certain folks do not wish to tent up their home, place of business and lay deadly chemicals (in the vicinity of their animals or family) or have to evacuate in hopes to get rid of their roach infestation.Most folks come to us because they don’t wish to pay $500 to $1,000 for a thorough roach treatment. Keep in mind, this fee does not include the repeat service that will be required after completing the inspection.

Top Product of 2014 for Green Pest Control









by Senam – Amazon Review


Below Are Only A Few 5 Star Reviews We Received From
Amazon, Ebay Sears, MyCleaningProducts.com and our other retailers.


by Barb Kelly – Amazon Review


Worked very well. Have not seen a live roach and has been two weeks since I sprayed. Thanks Roach Bully!








I bought this because we had a roach problem. It has a slight odor that smells pleasant. It doesn't give me an asthma attack the way that poisons do. It takes a little longer for the bugs to die, but they do die. I have used it on ants and spiders also.


I recently had a roaches outbreak, and I would see them even in the middle of the day. After I got this item, I sprayed it all over my house, (everywhere) and let it dry for a few minutes (or hours) and then went to bed: I did not see one roach!

After I washed my older blanket -which I thought the roaches were hiding in- I sprayed it silly, as well, and went to sleep soundly. Those roaches have not come back yet.

This product works!! The roaches might simply be hiding for now, I’m not sure, but I intend to spray my entire bed room soon, to make sure they never show their ugly bug faces again. This was a good expense.


We were scared out of our wits with roaches when I notice a roach crawling on my child. I found you guys from a friend and want to thank you. Roach Bully is a great product and worked as promised. No more  roaches. You have saved me a ton of worry. Thank you.


A Must If You Have A Roach Problem!








We recently had roaches in my apartment building. They did not hire an exterminator right away. I purchased this product and sprayed the area in the doorway to my apartment because I did not want the roaches coming into my apartment. I also sprayed the areas under my bathroom and kitchen sinks. I believe that this product helped a lot.

I have not seen any roach in my apartment and I hope I never do.


Great Stuff!

- Stephanie - Amazon Review


This has been used on two occasions in the past three years due to apartment roach infestations. It has been effective both times. The smell is there, but not unpleasant. We have a house cat and the product has been harmless, as described, to her. This product is a very “green” product and I highly recommend this over any type of chemical infestation treatment that may be out there. Shipping was great as well as packaging.


Bully Those Roaches


Bully Those Roaches!








by Gentle Deer Lion Tamer– Amazon Review


I had Roach Bully sent to my son who is living in Harlem. He had roaches all over the house. I sent him detailed instructions on how to use it with DE. Needless to say, the kid did not follow my instructions and just sprayed it around and sprinkled the DE into the carpet where he sleeps!

Thankfully it WORKED!

He sleeps on the floor on an air mattress and this stuff works! The roaches have disappeared and his spirits are better.

He thinks I’m joking when I told him that when he comes home he’s coming in the back door naked while I take his stuff to the laundromat ha ha!


Roach Bully has been a Top Green Product with large pest control companies, hotels and health facilities, farms, and animal clinics. Since it’s public release we have already received great feedback from our customers in helping them get rid of their roach problem.

 Educational Background



B.S. in Electrical Engineering 


Auburn University

                  Auburn University (AU or Auburn) is a public university located in Auburn, Alabama, United States. With more than 25,000 students and 1,200 faculty members, it is one of the largest universities in the state. Auburn was chartered on February 7, 1856, as the East Alabama Male College, a private liberal arts school affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In 1872, the college became the state's first public land-grant university under the Morrill Act and was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama. In 1892, the college became the first four-year coeducational school in the state. The curriculum at the university originally focused on arts and agriculture. This trend changed under the guidance of Dr. William Leroy Broun, who taught classics and sciences and believed both disciplines were important in the overall growth of the university and the individual. The college was renamed the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) in 1899, largely because of Dr. Broun’s influence. The college continued expanding, and in 1960 its name was officially changed to Auburn University to acknowledge the varied academic programs and larger curriculum of a major university. In 1964, under Federal Court mandate AU admitted its first African American Student. It had been popularly known as "Auburn" for many years. Auburn is among the few American universities designated as a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant research center.
