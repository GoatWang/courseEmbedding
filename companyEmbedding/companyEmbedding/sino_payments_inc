CORPORATE OVERVIEW  History of Sino Payments, Inc.  We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 26, 2007 under the name China Soaring Inc. On November 26, 2008, we changed the Company's name to Sino Payments, Inc. Our initial business was to operate a credit card processing and merchant-acquiring services company that provides credit card clearing services to merchants and financial institutions in PRC. Since inception, we have strived to implement our initial business plan, including the key step of creating our Global Processing Platform ("SinoPay GPP") and establishing our website, www.sinopayments.com. The initial business plan has been modified as indicated below.  As reported above under "New Developments," we are implementing a corporate name change from "Sino Payments, Inc." to "Value Exchange International, Inc." This name change should be consummated twenty (20) days after the mailing of a definitive information statement, which mailing should occur on or before October 31, 2016.  As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we seek to help clients improve their business systems and information technology or "IT" effectiveness. Specifically, the Company's business is in part to be a provider of Internet Protocol ("IP") processing services in Asia to bank card-accepting merchants ("IP Business"). We market our services to local merchants with regional retail locations across Asia Pacific as potential customers of their IP and related credit card and debit card processing systems. We offer interoperability through what is envisioned as a highly efficient infrastructure and perceived exceptional knowledge of the IP processing market through our SinoPay GPP platform. The SinoPay GPP system facilitates the processing of all major credit card types (Visa/MC/AMEX/Diners/Discover/JCB) and will be integrated with China UnionPay to provide processing of UnionPay Debit cards in Hong Kong SAR and PRC.  As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we still have not implemented any IP Business to any customer. While we have a functioning SinoPay GPP system product for sale, we have yet to sell any SinoPay GPP system to a customer as of the date of this Report on Form 10-Q. We will continue to promote the SinoPay GPP system, but our primary focus is on growing our IT Business because our strategic decision that IT Business presents greater growth and profit potential than IP Business in the short term. Further, we believe that the SinoPay GPP system will require ongoing and potentially expensive marketing and sales effort due to the highly competitive and rapidly changing (due in part to the growth and evolution of e-commerce on the Internet) market for Point of Sale ("POS") systems and longer sales cycle for POS systems than IT Business project and consulting sales. Due to the cost of market penetration for the SinoPay GPP, we may suspend or reduce promotion of the SinoPay GPP from time to time in order to enhance our focus on the IT Business.  Industry Trends and Economic Conditions  The Company's experience is that the IT Business in Hong Kong SAR and PRC is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of competitors as well as being a highly competitive industry. A general trend affecting our IT Business is the trend of increasing competition for skilled labor with technical skills. With a global economy and foreign competitors seeking to penetrate Hong Kong SAR and PRC as markets as well as to tap into new pools of skilled workers in IT Business, we will undoubtedly face increasing competition for skilled workers in IT Business in the Hong Kong SAR and PRC markets. We may be unable to afford or effectively compete for necessary skilled workers in Hong Kong SAR and PRC and, if we are unable to afford or effectively compete for necessary skilled workers, our growth and ability to attain and sustain profit operations in the IT Business may fail. We have not experienced any significant problems in recruiting necessary skilled workers in fiscal year 2015 or in year 2016 to date.  A common problem in the IT Business is retaining skilled workers throughout the duration of a project or contract. Due to the global nature of the IT Business and the growing demand for skilled IT Business workers, a skilled IT business worker can often readily find higher paying positions with competitors, whether local or foreign. While we have not experienced retention problems due primarily to our focus on smaller, shorter term IT business projects and contracts, we may experience retention of skilled worker problems if we grow our IT Business and undertake longer term, more complex IT business projects for customers.  IT Business is often affected by general economic conditions. During periods of economic growth, customers tend to spend more for IT Business products and services. During periods of economic contraction or uncertainty, such spending is expected to decrease or to be deferred. As such, the prospective business for our IT Business is generally greater during periods of economic growth or stability in Hong Kong SAR or PRC and decreases during periods of economic decline or stagnant growth, or any economic uncertainty, in Hong Kong SAR and PRC.  The IT Business is global and there is a growing capability and infrastructure for companies in a foreign nation to provide IT Business to customers around the globe as a complement to growth in cloud computing. We have not seen any significant impact of cloud computing on our IT Business in fiscal year 2015 or 2016 to date, but we perceive that the expansion of cloud computing could allow foreign customers to provide IT Business products and services to its cloud computing customers in our Hong Kong SAR and PRC core markets. We may find it more difficult to compete for IT Business in Hong Kong SAR and PRC if customers of the IT Business elect to have cloud computing companies host, manage, repair and enhance IT Business products, software and systems. The growth of cloud computing coupled with IT Business products and services as an ancillary component of the cloud computing menu of products and services could adversely impact our IT Business in Hong Kong SAR and PRC markets.  The nature of our IT Business is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable from customers. Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either every two weeks or monthly. If the demand for our IT Business products and services increases, we may generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our workers on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable are outstanding for much longer than normal payment cycle, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our IT Business products and services declines, we may generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level. This results in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. Overall outcome will be an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be sustainable in the event that a local or global economic downturn continued for an extended period.  In order for us to remain successful in the near term, we must continue to maintain and grow our customer base, provide high-quality service and satisfaction to our existing clients, and take advantage of cross-selling opportunities within and between the IT Business and IP Business. In the current economic environment, we must offer our customers with services that are appropriately priced, satisfy their needs, and provide them with measurable business benefits. While we have recently experienced higher demand for our IT Business products and services, we believe that it is too early to determine if developments will translate into sustainable improvements in our pricing or margins for fiscal year 2016 and over the longer term.  The increasing need for cybersecurity products and technologies may be a future weakness of our current business plan. We currently do not have a cybersecurity product and service line beyond consultants engaged to provide cybersecurity consulting services. Cybersecurity companies may have an advantage over our business model in the future in that cybersecurity companies could leverage their cybersecurity offerings to also sell IT Business services and products that compete with our IT Business products and services.  Share Exchange  On January 1, 2014, we received 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of in VEI CHN in exchange for i) newly issued 12,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to the majority stockholder of VEI CHN; and ii) 166,667 shares of our Common Stock held by VEI CHN to be transferred to the majority stockholder of VEI CHN ("Share Exchange"). This transaction resulted in the owners of VEI CHN obtaining a majority voting interest in the Company. The merger of VEI CHN into the Company, which had nominal net assets, results in VEI CHN having control of the combined entity.  For financial reporting purposes, the transaction represents a "reverse merger" rather than a business combination and the Company is deemed to be the accounting acquiree in the transaction. The transaction is being accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization. The Company is the legal acquirer but accounting acquiree for financial reporting purposes and VEI CHN is the acquired company but accounting acquirer. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that will be reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the transaction will be those of VEI CHN and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of VEI CHN, and no goodwill will be recognized in this transaction. The consolidated financial statements after completion of the transaction will include the assets and liabilities of VEI CHN and the Company, and the historical operations of the Company and the combined operations of VEI CHN from the initial closing date of the transaction.  History of Value Exchange Int'l (China) Limited  VEI CHN was first established on November 16, 2001 in Hong Kong SAR with limited liability under the name of Triversity Hong Kong Limited and subsequently changed its name to Triversity (Asia Pacific) Limited on April 24, 2002 and then further changed its name to TAP Investments Group Limited on November 16, 2007.  VEI CHN is an investment holding company with two subsidiaries established in Hong Kong SAR, namely TAP Services (HK) Limited, which was incorporated on August 25, 2003 and acquired by VEI CHN on September 25, 2008, and subsequently changed to its current name as Value Exchange Int'l (Hong Kong) Limited ("VEI HKG") on May 13, 2013, and Ke Dao Solutions Limited ("KDSL"), which was incorporated on May 14, 2013. VEI CHN also set up a Wholly-owned Foreign Enterprise (WOFE) in Shanghai, PRC, in September 2, 2008 in the name of Value Exchange Int'l (Shanghai) Limited ("VEI SHG").  Principal business  The principal business of VEI CHN for more than 15 years is to provide the Information Technology Services and Solutions or the "IT Business" (consisting of select services and solutions in computer software programming and integration, and computer systems, Internet and information technology systems engineering, consulting, administration and maintenance, including e-commerce and payment processing) to the Retail Sector, primarily to leading retailers in Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR and PRC and as more fully described below. As is customary in the industry, such services and solutions are provided by both company employees, contractors and consultants. The primary services and products of the IT Business are:  a)  Systems maintenance and related service  VEI CHN Group provides development, customization of software and hardware, enhancements thereto and maintenance services for installed POS system. VEI CHN Group markets, sells and maintains its own brand of POS software - edgePOS as well as third party brands (e.g. NCR / Retalix, which is one of the leading POS software programs in the market). These software enhancements and programming can integrate with different IP systems.  Systems maintenance services consist of: i) software maintenance services, including software patches and software code revisions; ii) installing, testing and implementing software; iii) training of customer personnel for the use of software; and iv) technical support for software systems.  Other services include system installation and implementation, including i) project planning; ii) analysis of customer information and business needs from a IT perspective ("System Analysis"); iii) design of the entire system; iv) hardware and consumables selection advice and sales; and v) system hardware maintenance. These services typically consist of customer projects for New Store Opening ("NSO") and Install, Move, Add and Change ("IMAC") for retail, and ad-hoc custom system projects for other business sectors. Our primary market and focus is the retail sector in Hong Kong SAR and PRC.  b)  Systems development and integration  VEI CHN Group provides value-added software, which integrates with customer owned or licensed software, and ad-hoc software development projects for other business sectors. Besides the use of proprietary, custom software code, our services may from time to time license standard third party software programs.  With the completion of the Share Exchange and throughout fiscal year 2015 and 2016, we are focusing and will focus its business in IT Business, and seek to expand its services to commercial customers in PRC and Asia Pacific Region. This strategy is based upon our subjective business judgment that the IT Business presents more opportunities for potential customer orders in our core markets of Hong Kong SAR and PRC than the IP Business and presents an industry segment that better suits our current technical capabilities, marketing capabilities and financial resources.  With respect to the IP Business, the Company will seek to implement its IP Business and related credit card and debit card processing systems as part of and enhancement for the IT Business to the Retail Sector. There has been no significant integration of the businesses in fiscal year 2016 and there is no deadline for such integration, which will occur as and when the Company can afford to and deems it propitious to integrate operations.  Financial Performance Highlights  The following are some financial highlights for the third fiscal quarter of 2016:  �  Net revenue: Our net revenues were $942,693 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,687,441 for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $744,748 or 44.1%.  �  Gross profit: Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $222,335 or 23.6% of net revenues, as compared to $205,466 or 12.2% of net revenues, for the same period in 2015, an increase of $16,869 or 8.2%.  �  Loss from operations: Our loss from operations totaled $12,759 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to loss from operations totaled $8,752 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $4,007 or 45.8%.  �  Net loss: We had a net loss of $30,691 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net loss of $2,146 for the same period in 2015.  �  Basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.00 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 The following tables set forth key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues.

Net revenues were $942,693 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,687,441 for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $744,748 or 44.1%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in our revenue from i) systems development and integration with revenues decreasing from $73,018 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $23,211 for the three months ended September 30, 2016; ii) sales of hardware and consumables with revenue decreasing from $942,141 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $154,686 for the three months ended September 30, 2016; offset by an increase in our revenue from our systems maintenance with revenues increasing from $672,282 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $764,796 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Cost of services. Our cost of services is primarily comprised of our costs of technical staff, contracting fees to suppliers and overhead.

The decrease in cost of services was mainly attributable to the decrease in contracting fees to suppliers.  Gross profit. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $222,335 or 23.6% of net revenues, as compared to $205,466 or 12.2% of net revenues, for the same period in 2015, an increase of $16,869 or 8.2%. The increase of gross profit was largely due to the decrease in cost of services, offset by the decrease in net revenues in this period, as compared with the same period of 2015.

General and administrative expenses include the costs associated with staff and support personnel who manage our business activities, office rental expenses, depreciation charge for fixed assets, and professional fees paid to third parties.
