Michael D.  Shmerling






Managing Partner
	XMi High Growth Development Fund, LLC 
Michael D. Shmerling is a veteran entrepreneur who has established and grown profitable companies in a wide spectrum of industries. Mr. Shmerling began his career in 1977 with the Nashville office of Ernst & Ernst CPAs (now Ernst & Young). During this time he served on the audit staff in a variety of industries.
In 1980, following three years in the “Big Eight” accounting world, he co-founded the CPA firm Goldstein & Shmerling, CPAs. In 1987, Mr. Shmerling welcomed two new partners to form Shmerling, Faulkner & Mackie, CPAs. He left the firm in 1992 to pursue entrepreneurial ventures.
Following 15 years in public accounting, Mr. Shmerling’s entrepreneurial interests inspired him and several other local Tennesseans to found Transcor America, Inc. In establishing this company, Mr. Shmerling fostered the creation of a new industry dedicated to privatization and thereby improving the operations and logistics of nationwide prisoner transportation. The business, which Mr. Shmerling later sold to a New York Stock Exchange Company, was founded on the idea that the criminal justice system could save significant dollars by contracting with Transcor for moving prisoners from one jurisdiction to another.
Shortly thereafter, and concurrent with the growth of Transcor, Mr. Shmerling co-founded Corrections Partners, Inc., a prison management company. This enterprise was established to accommodate Transcor's growing demand for secure, transient space for prisoners in-route. Additionally, its goal was to capitalize on the overcrowded bed space in publicly managed facilities and provide economies of scale for the new facilities. Under his leadership, this company grew to include 9 facilities managed, contracted or under construction at the time of its sale in 1995. Notably, both Corrections Partners and Transcor still exist today under the Tennessee-based aegis of Corrections Corporation of America, Inc., and employ nearly 4,000 employees.
During this period, Mr. Shmerling was a friend – and mentor to Joe Freedman, a young energetic lawyer who had his own entrepreneur ideas. Mr. Freedman wanted to create a new business that enabled law firms to be served by temporary and short-term contract professionals, a relatively new and innovative concept at the time. Together they started Amicus Legal Staffing and through the team’s efforts the company grew until its ultimate sale to New York Stock Exchange Company - Accustaff, Inc. producing a strong return on the original investment.
Simultaneously, Mr. Shmerling refined a new business model based on then recent advances in internet technology. This model ultimately became Background America, Inc., soon to become a leader in the then nascent industry of employer-based background checks. The company grew quickly and in less than four years was sold to the NASDAQ traded security firm Kroll, Inc., which was subsequently sold to New York Stock Exchange Fortune 100 - Marsh, Inc. Mr. Shmerling was promoted to Executive Vice President, Board Member of Kroll, Inc. in 2001 while remaining Chairman and President of the Background Screening Group until its purchase by Marsh in July 2004.
At present, Mr. Shmerling serves as Chairman of XMi Holdings, Inc., a management and investment holding company. It is comprised of eight business units and employs approximately 40 people. In addition, he serves as the co-founder and Chairman of Choice Food Group, Inc. a Tennessee-based food manufacturing, distribution and retail company.
Mr. Shmerling is also active in the community, volunteering his time on a number of boards including:
	Current Board Service


		Nashville Area Chamber Of Commerce

		United Way of Metropolitan Nashville

		The Hermitage

		Abe’s Garden, Inc.

		Community Foundation of Nashville

	Past Board Service


		Fisk University

		Tennessee Performing Arts Center

		Nashville Public Library Foundation

		Tennessee Society of CPAs

		Renewal House

Mr. Shmerling received a Bachelor of Accountancy degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1977 and has been a licensed CPA (now inactive) for 32 years.

 Who is Abe?  






Abe's Garden was named after Abram C. "Abe" Shmerling, M.D., a caring physician who concerned himself with the health and well-being of others, particularly the underserved. Dr. Shmerling was deeply invested in the people and community he loved. As a doctor of internal medicine, Dr. Shmerling committed his 45-year career to his patients and was especially dedicated to the economically disadvantaged. In 1952, he established one of Nashville's first fully integrated medical clinics, Woodbine Clinic, in one of the poorest areas of Nashville. He also worked with Dr. Thomas Frist, Sr., the Metro Council and community leaders in the late 1970s to locate a site for Southern Hills Hospital, where he served as its first chairman of the board, as well as on its founding medical staff.
After a long medical career serving the people of South Nashville, Alzheimer's disease began to rob Dr. Shmerling of who he was. With each passing year, Alzheimer's took something from him, however small, day-by-day and week-by-week for 11 years until his passing on November 4, 2006 at age 79.
He is survived by his wife, Frances; and sons, Jim, Michael and Rob; daughter, Judy; and 10 grandchildren.
After witnessing his father's experience, Michael D. Shmerling, Abe's middle son, has taken on a mission to create Abe's Garden, a nurturing and innovative campus in Nashville for individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Use of the word “garden” is appropriate to describe this care community because many Alzheimer's residents like to wander, and Abe's Garden is being designed around a spacious, secure, well designed outdoor courtyard so residents may wander in their own special garden setting as Abe would have liked.

Did You Know?

For every person diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease there are 10 to 12 others – family, co-workers and neighbors – who are directly impacted.

Evidence-Based

Low resident-to-caregiver partner ratio with innovative, evidence-based, continual quality improvement, staff training, programming and staffing models.




I see Abe's Garden becoming the leading American center in Alzheimer's care and contributing to research into the causes of Alzheimer's and other dementias.  It will be a leader in what is becoming a major medical problem, and I'm just glad we can help in some way.

– Jim Daniell

            COMMENTEMAILMORENashville real estate investor Michael D. Shmerling and other family members are seeking a rezoning of nearly an acre at Pearl and Fisk streets with plans to build a pair of multifamily buildings with 50 one-bedroom residential units.With approval Wayne Enterprises — Shmerling's daughter Katie and her husband, Adam Wayne — could by year's end start construction of what the investor referred to as "affordable" apartments on the North Nashville site."There's definitely a need for more affordable housing in the neighborhood to compliment the high-end, which is the majority of residential units around there," Shmerling said, citing the Eleventh North luxury apartments at 11th and Charlotte as one example. "Our goal is for those to be half the price of the average facilities in the neighborhood, but they're small and they're modest, and they're not going to have swimming pools, tennis courts and wine cellars."The plan calls for monthly rents for the apartments to start at below $1,000, with about half of the units between $900 and $1,000, Shmerling added.Shmerling, chairman of XMi Holdings Inc., is no stranger to investing in real estate in the area where the land, which he owns, is located between Charlotte and Jo Johnston avenues. Nearly eight years ago, he bought the old Duck Head clothing manufacturing building on Charlotte Avenue and renovated it into an office and residential complex that's home to the Oasis Center, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Middle Tennessee and several other nonprofit organizations.XMi Property Management is expected to manage the apartments to be built on the site behind the parking lot for the Youth Opportunity Center complex, which those nonprofit groups occupy. The project site also sits across Pearl Street from Grace M. Eaton Childcare & Early Learning Center and is next to the Metro Development and Housing Agency's HOPE VI affordable housing.Shmerling is also one of Midtown Nashville's biggest property owners, even after selling off several holdings. Within the Church Street-Midtown corridor, he owns more than 300,000 square feet of multi-tenant office properties, plus several acres of land and standalone properties available for redevelopment.Reach Getahn Ward at 615-726-5968 and on Twitter @getahn.
