 Oracle E-Business Suite 12.2 Now Available


                                      
                                                                                     By: Steven Chan
| Senior Director
                                                                              
                                 
We are very pleased to announce that Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12.2 is generally available for download now:


Oracle Software Delivery Cloud



EBS 12.2 represents our most-groundbreaking release in years (Press Release).  It includes new product functionality, new Fusion Middleware and database components, and introduces new tools for installing, configuring, and maintaining E-Business Suite environments:
Hundreds of new features
Includes significant enhancements across the integrated suite of business applications spanning enterprise resource planning, human capital management, and supply chain management.  You can find the complete list here:

E-Business Suite 12.2 Release Content Document (Note 1302189.1)

Online Patching
Apply EBS patches while users are still entering transactions and using the E-Business Suite.  Online Patching uses the Oracle Database's Edition-Based Redefinition feature and other new technologies to allow the E-Business Suite to be updated while the system is still running. You can learn more about Online Patching via our official documentation and this technical webcast.
WebLogic Server
Uses Oracle WebLogic Server, which replaces the Oracle Containers for Java (OC4J) application server used in EBS 12.0 and 12.1.  You can learn more about how this improves the system administration experience via our official documentation and this technical webcast.
Streamlined installation

Option for installing EBS 12.2 on to existing database servers.
Capability of installation into existing Real Application Clusters environments.
Database deployment on Automatic Storage Management (ASM) and other file systems.


Upgrading to EBS 12.2

Is there a direct upgrade path from EBS 11i to 12.2?
Yes, there is a direct upgrade path from EBS 11.5.10.2 to EBS 12.2.  EBS 11.5.10.2 customers do not have to install an intermediary EBS 12 release (such as 12.1.3) before upgrading to EBS 12.2.  EBS 11.5.10.2 customers must have applied the minimum baseline patch requirements for Extended Support as described in Patch Requirements for Extended Support of Oracle E-Business Suite Release 11.5.10 (Document 883202.1). Customers on earlier EBS 11i releases (such as 11.5.7) need to be at the 11.5.10.2 level plus the minimum baseline patch requirements for Extended Support before they can upgrade to EBS 12.2.
Is there a direct upgrade path from EBS 12.0 to 12.2?
Yes, there is a direct upgrade path from EBS 12.0.4 and 12.0.6 to EBS 12.2.  EBS 12.0.4 or 12.0.6 customers do not have to install an intermediary EBS 12 release (such as 12.1.3) before upgrading to EBS 12.2.  Customers on earlier EBS 12.0 releases (such as 12.0.3) will need to be at the 12.0.4 or 12.0.6 level before they can upgrade to EBS 12.2.
Is there a direct upgrade path from EBS 12.1 to 12.2?
Yes, there is a direct upgrade path from EBS 12.1.1, 12.1.2, and 12.1.3 to EBS 12.2.

How can I prepare for EBS 12.2?

Hii Steven,Great sound hear about it. Hopefully minor bug if upgrade from 11.5.10.2 with database 11.2.0.1 to 12.2.0 :)Thanks StevenRegards,Adnan


Juan Alcocer Saturday, September 21, 2013
OMG... Right in the middle of our 11i - R12.1.3 upgrade..


MOTOTAKA YOSHIDA Saturday, September 21, 2013
Thanks so much,  Steven!Regards,Mototaka in Japan


Chris Saturday, September 21, 2013
I can't see any of the referenced documents on MOS.. did they get pulled?


Steven Chan Sunday, September 22, 2013
Hi, Chris,All of the Note numbers worked -- I just checked them again.  Did you log into My Oracle Support?  It can't hurt to log in first before clicking the links.Regards,Steven  


Bob Sunday, September 22, 2013
Hi Steven:Can you explain / clarify the licensing implications for E-Business Suite customers with full use of iAS EE?


Walt Monday, September 23, 2013
This is great, lots of great new features!  Is 12.2 certified with the 12c database yet?  It looks like the certifications on Metalink have not been updated yet for 12c database for 12.1.3 either.  If we are on 12.1.3+ with 11.2.0.3 database, would it be better to move to 12.2 applications before the 12c database upgrade, or vice versa?


Dhilip Ranganathan Monday, September 23, 2013
Hello Steven,Thanks for the update about 12.2, this is great news. I am really excited to test online patching. Now I need to get trained on WebLogic.Best Regards,Dhilip Ranganathan.


Steven Chan Tuesday, September 24, 2013
Hi, Bob,Licencing terms are covered in the EBS Price List Supplement; please refer to that for the authoritative list of licencing conditions or check with your Oracle account manager.  I am not a licencing specialist and cannot provide authoritative guidance on licencing.EBS 12.2 uses Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) instead of Oracle Containers for Java (OC4J).  Customers' existing E-Business Suite licences will cover these requirements.  Existing E-Business Suite licences include iAS EE, which in turn includes WLS Basic.  In other words, WLS Basic covers the use of WLS in EBS 12.2 for standard uncustomized EBS environments.  No additional licencing is required for EBS 12.2's use of WLS in uncustomized environments.  Regards,Steven  


guest Tuesday, September 24, 2013
Hi Steven,Great job as always! Thank you for the insight. Please advise the best answer for customers who are preparing for their upgrade to R12.1.3 and now asking whether they can go straight to R12.2?Thank you for your time,Lydia


Naim Tuesday, September 24, 2013
Hi StevenGreat news to hear the release of 12.2.We are in the process of implementing 12.2 (fin + Hr) for our customer and would like to know the known issues and how stable this release will be inorder to convince the customer .


Konka Kiran Kumar Tuesday, September 24, 2013
Dear Steven,Thanks for the update about 12.2, this is great news. It's been a long waiting for these new features & functionalities.Thanks,Konka Kiran Kumar

Chrystian Thursday, September 26, 2013
Hi Steven,What are the best practice for the use of Windows mobile devices like the Motorola MC9190 in a warehouse environment?I mean, to interact using telnet or web browsing?As you may know, in a warehouse the use of scanners for reading barcodes is almost always used.Regards,


guest Friday, September 27, 2013
Hi Steven, this is great, Is the 12.2 still using forms ?


Steven Chan Friday, September 27, 2013
Hello, Guest,EBS 12.2 may be installed as a fresh install.  You can upgrade to 12.2 from 11.5.10.2, 12.0.4, 12.0.6, and all patchsets in the 12.1 codeline.See the "12.2 Technical Planning Guide" (linked above) for more details.Regards,Steven  


Steven Chan Friday, September 27, 2013
Hi, Walt,We're still finalizing some details with our EBS 12.2 + Database 12.1.0.1 certification.  You can monitor this blog for updates.Our Certification database on My Oracle Support should reflect our 12.1.0.1 database certifications with the E-Business Suite by now.Your choice of upgrade ordering will depend upon your priorities.  I can't give you a date for our 12c Database + EBS 12.2 certification yet.  I would recommend upgrading your current environment to EBS 12.2 now, and applying the 12c (12.1.0.1) database upgrade later.Regards,Steven  


Steven Chan Friday, September 27, 2013
Naim,EBS 12.2 is fully certified for production environments for all E-Business Suite products.  This includes Financials and HRMS.  You need to apply some database interoperability patches; please review the installation documentation for details.Regards,Steven  


Steven Chan Friday, September 27, 2013
Hi, Lydia,You can upgrade to EBS 12.2 from EBS 11.5.10.2, 12.0.4, 12.0.6, and all of the 12.1 levels.Regards,Steven  


Steven Chan Friday, September 27, 2013
Hello, Guest,EBS 12.2 contains a mix of OA Framework (HTML/web-based) and Forms 10g-based content.Regards,Steven  


Steven Chan Friday, September 27, 2013
Hello, Chrystian,Our Warehouse Management products are certified with a variety of barcode scanners.  Sadly, I'm not a Warehouse Management specialist.  Your best bet would be to ask your Oracle account manager to provide you with a list of compatible devices.Regards,Steven  


guest Monday, September 30, 2013
Hi Steven,Thanks for the update. Since R12.2 has new Fusion Middleware, can we deploy the custom ADF pages in the same Weblogic server, which runs Oracle EBS R12.2?Thanks,Guna.


guest Monday, September 30, 2013
Steven,We would like to know what kind of upgrade path would be from 12.1.3 to 12.2. We are currently in 11.5.10.2 and is trying to decide to upgrade to 12.1.3 or 12.2. We would like to understand that the upgrade from 12.1.3 would be comparable to that of upgrading from 11.5.9 to 11.5.10. This would help us to understand the resources requirement moving from 12.1.3 to 12.2Thanks,Vasu


Navin Wednesday, October 2, 2013
do you know if Oracle Business Analytics Warehouse is certified yet with R12.2, if not how soon this can be expected.Thank you,


Steven Chan Thursday, October 3, 2013
Hi, Navin,I'm afraid that I don't.  I will inquire independently, but you might wish to log an Service Request against that product for an authoritative answer.Regards,Steven  


Simon Thursday, October 3, 2013
Hi StevenDo you know if there is a Oracle VM Template for EBS 12.2 in the pipeline ?  Always a great way to evaluate a new build !Regards,Simon


Steven Chan Thursday, October 3, 2013
Hi, Simon,I strongly agree!  We're working on them right now.  I'll post updates on this blog as soon as they're available.Regards,Steven  


zaheer Monday, October 7, 2013
Hi Steven,In R12.2 first installation screen its still listing oracle RDBMS version as 11.1.0.7.I believe it should be 11.2.0.3.thanks,Zaheer 


Steven Chan Thursday, October 10, 2013
Hi, Vasu,Upgrading from 12.1.3 to 12.2 will be relatively straightforward.Upgrading from 11.5.10.2 to either 12.1.3 or 12.2 will be a larger project.  There are a number of important functional enhancements in R12.x, including new support for multiple sets of books, subledger accounting, shared service centers, and more.  Getting the full benefit of these new functional enhancements will likely require involvement from your business end-users.  They may choose to redesign business processes to take advantage of new or streamlined steps in EBS, too.All of these activities may take some time and are needed regardless of whether your target is 12.1.3 or 12.2, so you should begin this work now.  All of this work for EBS 12.1.3 will carry over to EBS 12.2.Regards,Steven  


Max Arderius Thursday, October 10, 2013
Response to: "In R12.2 first installation screen its still listing oracle RDBMS version as 11.1.0.7."Zaheer,This is a known issue in startCD 12.2.0.46. This has been already reported in Bug:17194281 - TECHSTACK RDBMS VERSION DISPLAYED SHOWS 11.1.0.7. SHOULD B 11.2.0.3This only occurs when executing the startCD on a non oracle.com domain... and that's why it was probably not detected during the original QA cycle. 11.1.0.7 was the old release from 12.1. This version was hardcoded in the IntroPanel.java.The fix (IntroPanel.class v120.32) will be included in the next startCD 12.2.0.47. We don't have any estimates on when we will release it.Thanks much again for bringing this to our attention.Max


Steven Chan Friday, October 11, 2013
Hi, Navin,Yes, EBS 12.2 is certified with Oracle Business Analytics Warehouse.  You can log a Service Request against the Oracle Business Intelligence Applications (OBIA) product if you have questions about the various Infra+OBIA permutations that have been certified.Regards,Steven

Steven Chan Thursday, October 17, 2013
Hello, ILMW,I'm sorry to hear that you've encountered an issue with this.We can provide general conceptual guidance here, but I'm afraid that this blog isn't the best place to get technical support for specific issues like the one that you're working through.Your best bet would be to log a formal Service Request via My Oracle Support (formerly Metalink) to get one of our specialists engaged.  Please feel free to forward your Service Request number to me if it gets stuck in the support process for some reason.Regards,Steven


Steven Chan Wednesday, October 23, 2013
Hello, Guna,Sorry for the delay in responding to this.>can we deploy the custom ADF pages in the >same Weblogic server, which runs Oracle EBS R12.2We recommend against this.  In general, custom ADF applications should be deployed on a standalone server to ensure that technology stack updates for either stack remain independent.Regards,Steven  


guest Thursday, October 24, 2013
We are on 12.0.6 version. Shall we upgrade to 12.1.3 and then after few years upgrade to 12.2 or directly upgrade to 12.2 instead of 12.1.3.In India no one has upgraded to 12.2 so we are not aware about the stability of this product.I have IAS licenses for 12.0.6. Do i have to purchase Weblogic licenses for 12.2


Steven Chan Thursday, October 24, 2013
Hello, Guest,See:Should You Upgrade to E-Business Suite 12.1.3 or 12.2?https://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/12_1_3_or_12No additional WLS licences are required for EBS 12.2.Regards,Steven 


guest Sunday, October 27, 2013
Hi Steave,Non-Editioned objects can not reference editioned objects in 12.2, than how the views will changed when any col is added to the table.. during the OLP. R12.2 required double the space for the application(because of the RUN Edtion and Patch Edition) and lot of fragmentation will be happening in the DB because of the cleanup by the ADOP.. ? lot of CPU/Memory/Storage will be utilized to perform sync from Patch Edition to - > Run Edition -> patch Edition. Is there any way to avoid above and perform the patch directy to live DOWN system , if company is not working on 24*7. other than that patch objects will generate lot of Archive log right ? or no logging is enabled for such objects which will be cleaned up by ADOP during the last phase of the patch. Regards, Rochak  Puri 


guest Tuesday, October 29, 2013
Thanks Steven. We have done some customisation on report level.  Still we need not have to purchase WLS license if we plan to go for 12.2.We have license for IAS.


Steven Chan Tuesday, October 29, 2013
Hello, Guest,If you have purchased an iAS EE licence, you do not need to purchase any additional licences when upgrading to EBS 12.2.Regards,Steven  


Santiago Bastidas Wednesday, November 6, 2013
Hello Rochak,You are correct, non-editioned objects cannot reference editioned objects in R12.2. When a column is added to a table via a patch, the editioning view projecting the relevant columns in the table is updated, adding the new column. This change in the editioning view is isolated to the patch edition, hence only visible to that edition.R12.2, as you mentioned, requires double the amount of space, but only on the file system. On the database side, thanks to EBR, we perform a smart copy of the objects, only the objects patched are copied. Cleanup removes objects that have been replaced with new versions in the last patching cycle. We have not observed a significant performance degradation related to fragmentation on the system tablespace, but we do recommend that you perform an actualize_all operation periodically in order to keep the amount of editions low. Please review the Oracle E-Business Suite R12.2 Maintenance guide to learn more about the actualize_all operation.All patches in R12.2 are designed to work online. In environments that do not require 24x7 availability, you could apply your patches with the system offline, that will free up resources, you could take advantage of those resources by allocating more workers during the execution of the apply phase.The editioning operation comprises several DML operations that surely will be captured by the archive logging infrastructure in the database. The same applies to cleanup operations.Regards,Santiago


Omar Halaseh Tuesday, November 12, 2013
Dear Steven,Hope all is well.I just want to make sure what to recommend to new customers. Should we recommend 12.2 or 12.1.3? Looking at OOW Presentation, Oracle seems to be shy about it with their recommendations:Choose 12.2 if you:– Need the high availability provided by Online Patching– Want the functional enhancements that are in 12.2– Prefer to invest in a single project to upgrade directly to 12.2Choose 12.1 if you:– Prefer to target a release with thousands of live customers– Would like to stay on 12.1 for 3-5 years before upgrading to 12.2– Need to move from a release below 11.5.10 with no direct upgrade to 12.2If you give this recommendation to new customers, they will be nervous about 12.2 and will lean more towards 12.1 which has wider customer base.What do you recommend for new customers?Best Regards--Omar Halaseh


Steven Chan Tuesday, November 12, 2013
Hi, Omar,It's really up to customers to decide which release meets their needs better.  We've given detailed guidance for making that choice here:Should You Upgrade to E-Business Suite 12.1.3 or 12.2?https://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/12_1_3_or_12Regards,Steven  


Omar Halaseh Tuesday, November 12, 2013
Thanks Steven,That's understandable for upgrades, but does this guidance apply for new customers as well?Are there other recommendations/guidance for new customers to start with 12.1.3 versus 12.2, or just go ahead with the tip release?Best Regards--Omar


Steven Chan Tuesday, November 12, 2013
Omar, This guidance applies to all EBS customers.  Regards,Steven  


Wendell Monday, November 18, 2013
Hi, StevenCan you tell me when Oracle will provide training course for R12.2?Thanks,Wendell


Espen Barroso-Gomez Thursday, November 28, 2013
Hi, Steven! Thanks as always for all the crucial, right to the point, information and updates on all things EBS!There is one thing me and my colleagues are having problems discovering from the above and from MOS material - and that's how a direct upgrade path can exist from 11.5.10.2 to 12.2, when the former can only (certifiably - I know it can be tweaked) run on 32-bit, and the latter is only certified on 64-bit. The devil's in the detail, and I guess this detail is hidden in there somewhere - since no one else has asked this, I guess I am missing something very obvious (forgive me in that case). 


guest Thursday, November 28, 2013
Hi Steven,I would like to know if 12.2. is the same as RUP6 patch or is it different? 


Tom Andersen Monday, December 2, 2013
Hi Steven,I have a question on the use of Coherence in WLS.Is Coherence included in the default install and license for 12.2?If so, how is it used in 12.2, and what is the impact of using Coherence?Where do you see Coherence bringing better caching and thereby better performance experience to the application.ThanksTom


Steven Chan Monday, December 2, 2013
Hi, Espen,If you're on a 32-bit platform that doesn't have an equivalent certification on EBS 12.2, you must migrate to a platform that's certified with EBS 12.2.  After you've migrated your platform, then you can apply the 12.2 upgrade.If your EBS 11.5.10.2 environment is already on a 64-bit platform that's certified with EBS 12.2, then you can simply apply the 12.2 upgrade.Regards,Steven  


Steven Chan Monday, December 2, 2013
Hi, guest,No, EBS 12.2 is much bigger than a Release Update Pack.  It's a major new release with changes to all E-Business Suite products and the accompanying technology stack.Regards,Steven  


Steven Chan Monday, December 2, 2013
Hi, Tom,No, Coherence is not included in the EBS 12.2 technology stack. Coherence is not certified with any E-Business Suite release today.We have done some analysis on the performance benefits.  Given that the E-Business Suite is an OLTP system as opposed to a ROLAP/MOLAP system, the benefits appear to be relatively limited when compared to Coherence's memory requirements.Regards,Steven  


Tim Monday, December 23, 2013
Hi StevenParallel concurrent processing. Is there a clean way to stop just one node , say to allow the underlying host to be rebooted?


Steven Chan Monday, December 23, 2013
Hi, Tim,I confess that I know little about PCP, and most of my staff are on holiday right now.  Your best bet to get an answer immediately would be to log a Service Request against PCP.Regards,Steven  


Steven Chan Monday, December 23, 2013
Hello, Wendell,We're working with Oracle University to provide new courses for EBS 12.2 right now.  Watch this blog for updates, which I'll post as soon as they're available.Regards,Steven  


Anne Carlson Wednesday, December 25, 2013
Hi Wendell,We also provide "what's new" training for EBS 12.2 in "Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12.1 and 12.2 Transfer of Information (TOI) Online Training", MOS Note 807319.1


Ramesh Friday, January 3, 2014
Hi StevenWe are planning to install a new R12.2 EBS version in next few months.Currently Database 12c is not certified with R12.2Can we expect the certification soon for 12cregardsRamesh


Steven Chan Friday, January 3, 2014
Hi, Ramesh,Our certification of EBS 12.2 + Database 12c is still underway.  It's going well but will take a bit longer to complete.Oracle's Revenue Recognition rules prohibit us from discussing certification and release dates, but you're welcome to monitor or subscribe to this blog. I'll post updates here as soon as soon as they're available.    Regards,Steven

HI Steven,I need screen hots if available for upgrading EBS from 11.5.10.2 to 12.2and the database version from 10.2.0.4 to 11.2.0.3


guest Thursday, January 9, 2014
Steven,As always your blogs and post make a good reading. Thanks. My client has been informed by someone that western european characterset WE8ISO8859P1 is not supported in fresh implementations of 12.2 or 12.2 upgraded from 11i.I read thru the install notes, release notes, Rapid Install guide and NLS release notes for 12.2 but did not come across such mandate. Can you please confirm and many thanks in advance.


guest Thursday, January 9, 2014
WE8ISO8859P1 as well as other native/legacy character sets are still supported in E-Business Suite release 12.2 for both fresh install and upgrades.My advice, however, is to carefully consider your options here:a) what set of languages does your client support today?b) what set of languages does your client plan to support in the near and long term?In general, I strongly recommend customers to start fresh implementations with Unicode (AL32UTF8) character set as it's a universal character set which supports all live languages, all new software only supports it, such as Oracle Fusion Apps, and it simplifies interoperability with other software.WE8ISO8859P1 character set does not support the Euro symbol, so instead, I would suggest WE8ISO8859P15, if your client plans to support some of the Western European languages.Bear in mind that character set migration is a big project that entails data cleansing and remedying character expansion issues ...etc. It's important to carefully consider all of the above at implementation/ upgrade times.  


guest Tuesday, January 21, 2014
Hi Steven,Good Morning...We are upgrading our instance from 11i to 12.2.3. We have a Sev1 SR with oracle support where we have a requirement of migrating services from one node to another node and the options we getting from them: 1. You cant move services and we need to redo entire process right from RI till upgrade (Which no customer agrees)2. Clone it to a new instance by changing the SID and self clone is not supported which is a very painful process.The answer we are receiving for self clone not supported is: As its not mentioned in any document its not supported. We actually don't know the difference between self cloning and actual cloning when the cleanup procedure is same for the both the processes. Support again says that self clone is supported for 11i and 12.1 as they tested it.By the way we tried doing self clone and it failed with one run of preclone and successful with an earlier run of preclone. I feel this is a bug but I doubt support helps us saying this is not a bug as the procedure itself is not supported as they confirmed with Development.We actually don't know how does changing the Database SID changes the procedure.


guest Tuesday, January 21, 2014
Hi Steven,Also its getting a bit hard to get right help from support on 12.2 Weblogic and cloning stuff. Why I say this? 1.For simple cloning process they are asking us to do the entire upgrade process again right from RI.2. They say cloning to new SID and new host is supported but not on the same host(self clone) just bcz as they "don't know" whether they tested. But that is not correct as far as I know. Moreover they say that Development told them about this!!!


Steven Chan Tuesday, January 21, 2014
Hello, Guest,I'm sorry to hear that you've encountered an issue with this.We can provide general conceptual guidance here, but I'm afraid that this blog isn't the best place to get technical support for specific issues like the one that you're working through.If you provide your Service Request number, we can follow up directly with the Support team assigned to your SR.Regards,Steven


guest Tuesday, January 28, 2014
Hi Steven,Nice blog! I would like to know what benefit it can give to a company? Also, would like to know about new features in 12.2 in finance, purchasing, inventory modules. Thanks!


Robert Farrington Tuesday, January 28, 2014
Hi Guest,A number of resources are provided in the article. Your best starting point might be this My Oracle Support knowledge document:"Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12.2 Information Center" (Doc ID 1581299.1)The following knowledge document will then help you learn about new features in specific products:"R12.1 / R12.2: Oracle E-Business Suite Releases 12.1 and 12.2 Release Content Documents" (Doc ID 1302189.1)Regards,Robert.


guest Wednesday, January 29, 2014
Hi Steven,I'm currently installing EBS 12.2 for a customer on top of Grid Infra (therefore RAC component will be activated). That environment will be ultimately cloned afterwards. However, to my big surprise, The EBS 12.2 Setup guide clearly says that cloning a RAC-enabled system is not certified with Rapid Clone (Advanced CLoning options - Option 4).Is there another workaround to clone the database tier at this time, since most of the EBS production environments are RAC-based? Most of the MOS notes refer to 12.1.3 version, not 12.2. Does that mean a current EBS 12.2 RAC-based production is not clonable with Rapid CLone?Cheers.Oumar


Brian Tuesday, February 4, 2014
Hi Steven, we are currently in the process of upgrading an Oracle EBS instance from 11i to 12.2.  Once upgraded, we plan to run the R12.2 readiness reports.   Couple of questions, 1) Does this process validate and try to remedy custom forms and reports?  Since these are binary objects, was not sure how they would be handled.  2) We ran a preliminary readiness report prior to upgrading, and found they have many db users defined.  Some are for 3rd party applications, but the majority are end users which have access to their own set of views/tables for general queries.  All of these showed up as invalid schemas, and ofcourse are not registered within Oracle.  Can these just be ignored in the readiness report, assuming the queries used are in compliance?Thank you.


Max Arderius Friday, February 14, 2014
Oumar, That is correct. Rapid Clone is currently in the process of being certified with RAC in the dbTier. You can still use rapid clone to clone the appsTier. In 12.2, the database cloning portion is practically the same, so you can clone the database separately (ie with RMAN) and use adcfgclone to configure the Database Oracle Homes, as it was done in 12.1. Please follow up with Oracle Support in case you need additional guidance.


Krishna Kari Sunday, February 23, 2014
Nice to know that R12.2 is released and the tech stack has now weblogic.


guest Monday, March 3, 2014
we are in the midst of our upgrade from 12.1.3 to 12.2.3. But are having a hard time getting ample support for ADOP related issues. The SR route is taking ages and the patch community seems to address only 12.1.3 and below issues. Is there a dedicated community out there for 12.2 related issues?feeling lost at the moment


Terri Noyes Monday, March 3, 2014
I'd like to help you, but will need more information.  Please provide an SR number so that I can research your issue(s).


guest Thursday, March 6, 2014
Thanks for your offer Terri. We have finally upgraded our assessment instance from 12.1.3 to 12.2.3 but are now facing problems with cloning. The SR we have opened for this cloning issue is SR 3-8599674311. We also have another issue with 'FNDCPASS not functioning for SYSADMIN accounts' in 12.2.3 SR 3-8645394741. cheers,dennis


guest Thursday, March 6, 2014
Dennis, thank you for sharing these details.  If progress on these is holding up your project, please raise the severity and they will be prioritized accordingly.  I do believe that a fix for the second issue listed is imminent.  The first may be an environment issue... Please continue to work with the analyst on that one.Regards, Terri


guest Wednesday, March 12, 2014
Steve, We met briefly last year when you came to visit us in London at the Ministry of Justice. I am now working on a very large implementation for the UK government (over 150,000 end users and every e-BS module under the sun except Manufacturing), and still feel nervous about putting forward 12.2 in a large government shared service organsisation, until we have seen some large 12.2 reference sites. Should I be prudent and go with 12.1.3 for a planned go live at the end of 2014? Regards,Nic WoodPrincipal solution Architect (Steria UK)    


Steven Chan Wednesday, March 12, 2014
Hello, Nic,The later any customer is in the adoption cycle, the smoother the road.  If your customer wishes to deploy an EBS release that thousands of customers are already running, then go for EBS 12.1.3.Check out the whitepaper linked in this article:Should You Upgrade to E-Business Suite 12.1.3 or 12.2? https://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/12_1_3_or_12Regards,Steven  


guest Tuesday, March 18, 2014
Hello Brian,Regarding your questions about the Readiness Reports:1) The current compliance checker report does not check Forms and Report binaries. We are working to enhance the reports and include those two file types.2) Any custom schema, listed by the readiness reports, owns objects that have dependencies on E-Business Suite code objects. These objects will become invalid if the schema is not registered with the application.To learn more about the preparation process to get to R12.2, I would recommend the following documents:   Oracle E-Business Suite Technical Planning Guide R12.2. MOS Note 1585857.1   Oracle E-Business Suite Concepts Guide R12.2, part of our documentation library for Release R12.2Regards,Santiago

Steven, as you know, Office Depot is working on the upgrade from 11i to R12, and we have a question regarding de-registration and re-registration of OID/SSO as part of the post upgrade steps.  We're being told that you only need to de-register the SSO partner app and then re-register - there is no need to de-register OID which could take a lot longer depending upon the number of subscriptions in EBiz.Please let us know,ThanksTerry

Bala Tuesday, April 29, 2014
Hello Steven,I have a question regarding DMZ setup in 12.2.3. I would like to know that if this is achievable or how this can be achieved. The configuration setup is as below : Server A is fully configured single node Application of 12.2 environment. We have proposals to install/configure the new application tier for DMZ within the same physical server "A" but with a VIP and a virtual hostname. We would like to perform this to avoid the extra licensing cost on having Application running on new or other server. Question is : 1. Is this achievable and how ? We have followed the DMZ setup in 12.2 MOS document 1375670.1 and typically Figure F9 (Option 2.4: Using Reverse Proxy with no External Web Tier) is our topology. Appreciate your inputs on this. Thanks,Bala


Jon Friday, May 9, 2014
Bala, I am interested in hearing if a single node architecture with the additional DMZ application tier will work using VIP and virtual host name. Please let me know if you are able to make this architecture work. Thanks, Jon 


Noby Joseph Friday, May 9, 2014
Bala/Jon,The configuration you are describing is currently not supported with E-Business Suite 12.2 . Thanks,Noby


Jon Friday, May 9, 2014
Hi Noby / Steven,Thank you for the quick response. Our 11i to 12.2.3 upgrade is scheduled for July. Do you have any idea when the reverse proxy topography will be supported? We could add the additional server in the interim, but this has expensive licensing implications. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.Jon  (DMZ setup in 12.2 MOS document 1375670.1, Figure F9 (Option 2.4: Using Reverse Proxy with no External Web Tier) for our topology.)

Does anyone have an opinion of whether we should upgrade from 11.5.10 to 12.1.3 or to 12.2.3?  We are billion dollar company.Also, does anyone have a list of bugs for 12.2.3? Our consultants are saying that 12.2.3 is relatively unstable.Thanks.


Puneet Friday, May 30, 2014
Hello Steven,It is always useful to read your blogs.I need you help to understand something which is very confusing and difficult to decide.How difficult or easy or feasible is it if we have to create some thing in ADF which is to be used in EBS 12.1.3 or 12.2.We are currently on 12.1.3 and some body told out management that ADF is good to use for customization with 12.1.3.But as per my understanding, to implement ADF, we need infrstructure changes.Also, I have heard that Oracle Development is developing some features in ADF for 12.2 future releases, is that correct.Regards,Puneet Goyal


Sara Woodhull Monday, June 2, 2014
Hi Puneet,Our first recommendation is always to use Oracle Application Framework (OA Framework) if you are integrating with Oracle E-Business Suite.  This is our primary development platform for EBS, and we are actively enhancing it, especially in the user interface area.  We use OA Framework for nearly all of our desktop and tablet applications.We usually recommend other tools only for very specific use cases.  For example, for cases where you have need something specific that only ADF has, such as the hierarchy view feature, you might choose ADF.  In fact, the HCM organization chart feature uses the hierarchy viewer (in Release 12.1 HRMS RUP5) in a "hybrid page" (OA Framework page with an embedded ADF region).  Oracle Electronic Kanban is also built using ADF (on 12.1.3).There is a considerable amount of extra effort required for the integration of ADF with the EBS UI.  If you are using ADF as a totally separate application (for example, using EBS web services on the back end) without trying to integrate with the EBS UI or security, then you simply have a separate infrastructure.For EBS smart phone applications we are using ADF Mobile with REST services from EBS. That is a special use case for us, and it does not require integrating the UI with the EBS desktop UI (OA Framework).See the Webcasts & Training link on the side of this blog for a couple of presentations on the topic (#26 and #28).  However, if you are trying to create an extension to EBS that will be used by the same users who use EBS desktop (and tablet) applications, we _strongly_ recommend OA Framework.Hope this helps!Thanks,Sara


Steven Chan Monday, June 2, 2014
Hello, Dave,You might find the whitepaper listed here useful if you're deliberating between EBS 12.1.3 vs. 12.2:Should You Upgrade to E-Business Suite 12.1.3 or 12.2? https://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/12_1_3_or_12Several EBS customers have successfully deployed EBS 12.2 in production so far, and many more are in the pipeline.

startCD48 was put out on Tuesday Jun 3 for 12.2.2 and 12.2.3Can this be used to initiate a fresh install of 12.2.0 with the intention of upgrading to 12.2.2 or 12.2.3?Appears that all prior versions of Note 1596433.1 have been obsoleted. 


Steven Chan Thursday, June 5, 2014
Hi, Joseph,Yes. You're monitoring things very closely!  Here's our external announcement:New Rapid Install StartCD 12.2.0.48 for EBS 12.2 Now Available https://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/new_rapid_install_startcd_122Regards,Steven  


Joseph Mathew Monday, June 9, 2014
Steve:Yes - following things closely since we're 'under the gun' to get a new 12.2.3 instance up and running and we're running into so many issues. We're trying to install on SLES11-SP2 (x86_64) - and have an SR open for which there's not been much traction. SR number is 3-9105985629 : Fatal Error: TXK Install Service - Cannot patch 10.1.2 Tools.We're seeing weird file system paths in some of the log files that do NOT pertain to our install path. 


Steven Chan Monday, June 9, 2014
Hello, Joseph,I'm sorry to hear that you've encountered an issue with this.  I've followed up with the Support Engineer assigned to your Service Request.  Please monitor your SR for updates.I've also contacted your Oracle account reps to see whether there are any ways that we can help make McLane's experience with EBS 12.2.3 a bit smoother.  I hope that they will follow up with you soon.Regards,Steven  


Joseph Friday, June 13, 2014
Hello Steve:Thank you for your prompt response from Jun 9th, 2014. We were able to resolve our isuses with the 12.2 install after discovering that the issue was caused from within our IT team.We were also able to apply the AD and TXK delta4 packs. However, after applying these packs, the forms interface (which used to open after the initial 12.2 install) refused to open - most likely because of the lack of a appropriate certificate. I believe Note 1591073.1 will help me resolve this. Yesterday we started the 12.2.3 upgrade after following all post-install steps in 1320300.1, 1617461.1 and 1594274.1 but have encountered issues similar to what I encountered when upgrading from 12.1.2 to 12.1.3. I have an SR (3-9154369711) open for this. It appears that I am not alone in this process since there are multiple hits on these error messages. I would appreciate if you could help route this SR to the appropiate service engineer. Thank you again for all your help. Joseph


Steven Chan Friday, June 13, 2014
Hello, Joseph,It appears that your latest SR is being handled by the right Support team.  I've offered assistance from us in ATG Development if it's needed.  Please monitor your SR for updates.Regards,Steven  


dennis uy Tuesday, July 22, 2014
is there a dedicated community for 12.2 upgrades... I've been experiencing problems with 12.2 upgrade steps recently.... specifically after applying the merged patch 10124646 ... suddenly the UTLRP (compile objects utility) started acting up with CYCLE detected errors and never finishes and this basically stalls the upgrade to 12.2 .. This is my 5th upgrade run.... the previous 3 were successful...but these later runs has gotten  me and the SR support baffled...  I have opened an SR for this( SR 3-8725193308 ) ... but it has been months and no solution yet... 


Steven Chan Tuesday, July 22, 2014
Hi, Dennis,I'm sorry that you're encountering issues with this. There is a forum dedicated to R12 upgrades, but we're also in the process of reorganizing things to make these easier to find.Regardless, I am very concerned about the amount of time that your SR has been open.  I have escalated this to Support management and will ensure that a Development engineer works directly with your assigned Support engineer on this.  Please monitor your SR for updates.In the future, please feel free to escalate SRs to me if they get stuck in the pipeline like this.Regards,Steven
