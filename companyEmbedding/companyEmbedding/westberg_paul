Overview



At this point, Paul Westerberg has been plying his trade as a solo artist for far longer than he fronted the late, lamented Replacements, and this 20-song set provides an intriguing look at the rolling career path he's charted on his own. Fittingly, Besterberg resonates with an unmistakable restlessness, documenting its creator's desire to be seen as a mature singer-songwriter as well as a punk graduate with an unreconstructed love for messed-up rock 'n' roll. The former vibe is more evident in earlier offerings, like the wrenching mid-'90s ballad "Love Untold" and the previously unreleased lost-romance musing "All That I Had." On a similar note -- at least in terms of bummed-out mindset -- "Let the Bad Times Roll" evokes the defeatist tone of Westerberg's most introspective 'Mats material. He recalls that band's tenor more often, naturally, on rockers like the cautionary flame-out stomp "World Class Fad" as well as the raggedly raunchy -- and unabashedly joyful -- "C'mon, C'mon, C'mon," which makes its first appearance here. The set is peppered with hard-to-find ditties, some of which merit unearthing -- like his Singles soundtrack contribution "Dyslexic Heart" -- and some of which might've been best left buried, like a mordant cover of the Beatles' "Nowhere Man." As with any artist with a following as rabid as Westerberg's, there might be some quibbling over the track listing -- but Besterberg strikes a balance between standards and oddities that should prove pleasing to all but the most cynical.

Editorial Reviews


All Music Guide  - Stephen Thomas Erlewine
The Replacements were touted as the Next Big Thing for so long that when leader Paul Westerberg struck out for a solo career in 1992, that same sense of expectation carried over to the new phase of his career. Of course, 1992 was a very different time from 1984, when the 'Mats released their breakthrough Let It Be, or even 1989, when the heavily scrubbed and polished Don't Tell a Soul represented a last-ditch attempt for crossover success for the band. In 1992, the doors to commercial mass acceptance for alternative rock had finally been broken down -- the very thing that many critics and pundits predicted that the Replacements would do. Nirvana opened the floodgates with Nevermind, and the climate of rock music changed considerably, just around the time that Westerberg was turning away from the rowdy rock & roll that had made his reputation and turning toward classic singer/songwriter-styled material. In the thick of the post-Nirvana fallout, Westerberg released the light, incessantly catchy "Dyslexic Heart" as his first single -- a song that he calls "a bit too cutesy for me" in the liner notes to the 2005 retrospective Besterberg, but the damage had already been done, since the single, and its association with Cameron Crowe's Seattle-glorifying slacker romantic comedy Singles, pegged Westerberg as being a little bit too desperate for crossover success. He may have helped kick off the cultural zeitgeist of the '90s, but now that the tide had turned, he was left behind. His 1993 full-length debut, 14 Songs -- a collection of polite Stonesy rockers and sensitive balladeering that wasn't all that bad but certainly wasn't hip -- didn't help matters, even if it got a fair amount of MTV airplay and charitable reviews, and by his second album, Eventually, in 1996, Westerberg began a long, slow slide to the margins of pop culture. He still retained a cult, but it got smaller with each release, no matter if some were stronger (Stereo) than others (Suicaine Gratifaction). 
It was such a drop-off in quality, such a diminishment of his stature -- once poised to be the savior of rock, he was simply stumbling along like his idol, Alex Chilton -- that it's hard for a compilation not to reflect this shift. To its credit, Besterberg goes out of its way to disguise this decline, with nearly half of the 20-song disc dating prior to Eventually, which is also represented by two outtakes that are superior to most of what wound up on the finished disc (including the vaguely misogynistic "C'mon, C'mon, C'mon," which nevertheless ranks as one of the most spirited, engaging rockers he's done in his solo career). This is because Besterberg rounds up B-sides and soundtrack contributions, so it's halfway between an introduction and a rarities clearing-house. Rhino has done this before with other '90s alt-rockers, but the difference here is that Westerberg really did toss off some of his most appealing songs onto B-sides and soundtracks, so compiling "Seein' Her," "Man Without Ties" (originally titled "Men Without Ties"), "A Star Is Bored," and "Stain Yer Blood" not only makes this a better listen, but it has the unfortunate side effect of showing how rough the latter half of the '90s was for Westerberg. Still, this does take the two best songs from Suicaine and has good representations of Mono, Stereo, and Come Feel Me Tremble -- just enough to give a sense of how Westerberg boxed himself into a corner where he could occasionally write a good song but was more content to just roll along. There are some good songs missing here -- in his notes, Westerberg says "Blackeyed Susan," "Ain't Got Me," and "Good Day" are among those missing in action -- but Besterberg rounds up everything of note and tells a disillusioned Replacements fan everything he needs to know.

 At 2:48pm on May 4, 2014, Michael Clegg said…    
Hello Paul,  Sorry that I have not written sooner, our days are crazy. 
We just finished our 5 greenhouse (GH), difficult to do given our high seasonal winds.
Our entire facility is solar-powered, soon we shall erect our new 1000 watt wind turbine. We will need the additional power. Our house is a different solar system and we also power WWoofer Cove, this is our housing for seasonal workers/ students.

I believe that you have an interest in solar, aside from our background in Aquaponics, my wife and I use to have a solar company back in Quintana Roo, Mexico. All along the beach there are small to medium size hotels and no Federal Electric, so that is where solar and wind comes into play. We built alternative power and wind systems there for 6 years. Big wind turbines, 6000 watt models and lots of wind. For clarity, we left Mexico due the a problem with the Zeta Drug Cartel, so here we are, back in the states. It does requires us to adapt to a quite different climate, from hot and humid, to just plain HOT or as they say here "it may be hot, but it is a dry heat."  
We will soon finish our new nursery, we're always in some degree of construction.

Our approach to Aquaponics is a bit different than others. we have the fish house (tilapia) , another for nutrient conversion. Then there is the three GH's where we grow horizontally/vertical, confusing, no. On each side there are rows of 3-4" tubes that continue on to the end of the structure, there are 3 tubes in each row. Now this is where it gets interesting, there are 3 sets of rows that rise vertically. Nutrient is pumped up and flows downward and sent back to the fish tanks, it is a synergistic approach, growing more in a lesser space. 
This allows us to grow-out nearly 900 plants. Much of what we grow there is bouquet crops, Chilchapin (a extremely hot, flavorful pepper), basil, Cilantro and the like. Beyond the GH's are a series of raised beds where we grow Armenian Cucumbers, tomatoes, too many to list here. All of our produce is Organic and the product flavor is fantastic and we sell at our produce local Farmers Markets. Direct sales, no other better way to keep more of your profit. 
Come fall we will convert over to winter crops for the raised beds and diminish our output in the GH's, sticking to cash crops, but raising enough for our consumption.

As meantioned earlier, it is hot here in the Tucson area, makes me quite glad that we have a pool for after hours use.

I am currently trying to catch a bite to eat while I answer emails on one Mac and preparing this email for you on another Mac. That is how the days are here...hectic. I realize how hectic it gets when I find myself running around the property with a iPad in one hand an the other hand steering my golf cart.

Well, enough of that, I must get back to work, thank God the days are longer.

Michael at Synergy Aquaponics

P.D Well, I look forward to hearing about your GH adventures and what approach you pursue in Aquaponics.

Hi Paul!
Bummed I missed it - currently in Florida dieing from the heat and humidity. Definitely want to make the October meeting. Maybe I'll have my system running by then.

Hi Paul,
Thanks for the information, I would love to attend but not sure if I'm available that day. I was able to locate Lonny in the Members Section, sent him a friend request. Would love to make the next meeting.

Hey Paul, thanks for the thumbs up. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. 
 
It looks like you have a decent lil setup going there. Looks like your life is a blast. Responsible and free. What a wonderful concept...I'm glad someone is able to.
 
Cheers
