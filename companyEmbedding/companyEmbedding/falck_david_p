This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today announced the 
      appointment of David P. Falck as Executive Vice President, General 
      Counsel and Secretary of Pinnacle West and Arizona Public Service 
      Company.
    


      With more than 20 years of experience as a legal advisor to the energy 
      industry, Falck comes to Pinnacle West from New Jersey-based Public 
      Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PSEG), a diversified energy company that 
      owns one of the nation’s largest electric utilities. While at PSEG, 
      Falck held the position of Senior Vice President – Law, with 
      responsibilities for the Law Department and the Office of the Corporate 
      Secretary.
    

      Falck will succeed retiring Senior Vice President, General Counsel and 
      Secretary Nancy Loftin, who joined the company in 1985. The changes will 
      take effect late-July 2009.
    

      “Nancy has helped steer Pinnacle West and APS through a variety of 
      challenges for more than two decades, and I know I speak for everyone at 
      the Company and on the Board when I say she will be missed as a 
      professional, a peer, a counselor and a friend,” said Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer Don Brandt.
    

      Prior to joining the senior management team at PSEG, Falck was a partner 
      and member of the Managing Board of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, 
      New York, an 800-lawyer firm with offices in the U.S. and abroad. He 
      joined Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts, a predecessor firm, in 1978.
    

      “David brings experience from a diversified energy company that rivals 
      ours in setting benchmarks in many areas of performance,” said Brandt. 
      “Additionally, he has a well-earned reputation as a real expert in 
      energy and utility law developed over the course of decades of 
      intensive, first-tier practice.”
    

      Falck holds a Doctor of Laws degree from Washington & Lee University 
      School of Law in Virginia, and an undergraduate degree from Colgate 
      University in New York.
    

      Pinnacle West is a Phoenix-based company with consolidated assets of 
      about $11 billion. Through its subsidiaries, the Company generates, 
      sells and delivers electricity and sells energy-related products and
