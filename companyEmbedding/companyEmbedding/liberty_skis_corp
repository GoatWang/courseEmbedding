COMPANY


WHAT WE DO
Liberty makes high performance skis rooted in functional innovation and respect for the environment. Every material we use, and design we produce, is done with the ultimate goal of elevating your experience on skis. Liberty skis perform so well because they are designed and built without regard to marketing hype or the latest trend. We test all our designs and materials ourselves to see if they improve the way our skis ride in a variety of conditions. If they do not improve the ski experience, then they don’t go in our skis. A great example of functional innovation is our exclusive use of bamboo laminate cores in our skis. Liberty was the first and remains the ONLY ski company to use bamboo in all our skis. Bamboo is strong, light, eco friendly, and gives our skis a unique stability and liveliness not found with any other material. Bamboo helps you ski better. Combining unique designs and the best materials available, we hand build skis to exacting standards, allowing Liberty to offer the best warranty in the industry at 3 years. We hand select bamboo from southern China, edges from Germany, bases from France, adhesives from the US, high tech composites from Germany, topsheets from Austria and plastics from Japan to create the most fun and versatile skis available.
WHY WE DO IT
More than just our name, liberty is the reason we make skis and what we seek in the mountains. Snow is where we find freedom. If you find a better job, let us know.
WHERE WE ARE
The location of Liberty HQ high in the Colorado Rockies affords us the chance to test our skis in a wide variety of conditions over a long season. With access to an incredible diversity of terrain, from world-class parks to massive backcountry lines and everything in between, our designs flow directly from our surroundings. Liberty makes versatile, light and tough skis that work in powder, on hardpack, slung on a backpack for a long hike, in the park, setup for tele turns, or just our ripping around your local area.
WHO WE ARE
Liberty is a collection riders from every imaginable background. We have powder whores, racers, former snowboarders, tele purists, park rats, and a bunch of people who just go ski.

THE LIBERTY DIFFERENCE


Ethic
At Liberty, we make skis like our lives depend on them.  Every ski is designed and tested in the heart of the Colorado mountains.  We start with the best materials from around the world, hand-build each pair, and back them with the best warranty in the business.  Our goal is to make the best skis possible, treat our customers like our ski partners, and continue to do what we love. 
Design Philosophy

Liberty has won awards from every major ski publication over the last ten years, but more important, has won the trust of countless skiers across the globe.  We design skis based on the concept of functional innovation.  This simply means we don’t add materials or features to our skis unless they improve the ski experience on snow. Our innovations are not included for marketing purposes, but because they will help you ski better, longer and faster in real world conditions.  In ski design, simple, strong, and light leads to the best products.  
Materials

We use the best materials available from around the world, and we never stop looking for ways to improve our skis. Every component we use in our skis is there because we believe it is the best answer to a specific design challenge.  We use bamboo because it is the lightest, most durable, and most responsive core material available.  We use UHMW PE for our sidewalls because it absorbs impact better than ABS and leads to a smooth ride at higher speeds.  Our bases are P-Tex 2000, 4000, and 4000 Electra, because they are the highest quality, fastest bases made.  All edges are custom made in Germany with a wider profile, larger anchors, and 2 different hardness ratings to be the most durable for their intended purpose.  Liberty uses a unique quadaxial S-Glass for our glass fiber, adding another axis of torsional reinforcement compared to most materials.  Additional vibration reduction, and top edge durability is provided by a Durathane polyurethane layer not found in other skis.  We use Titanal and FRP mats for additional stiffness and binding screw retention because they are the best materials to use in those applications.  
Liberty skis feel different, because they are different.  We are not just another brand at some big factory.  Look at the materials in most skis, and you will find the same stuff the major brand that owns the factory uses.  There is no difference in design, or materials, from brand to brand.   We are free to experiment and use whatever works best, without regard to what others are doing.  
About Bamboo

Liberty is the market leader in bamboo technology, and we use this tough, eco-friendly material in all our skis.  Liberty has been designing skis around our resilient and light bamboo laminate cores for more than ten years, and even though many companies have followed our lead, we remain the bamboo experts.  
Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants on earth, and can be sustainably harvested without killing the entire organism.  The roots stay in the ground when the top is cut; they help control erosion, and then sprout again, to be harvested in 3-5 years.  This leaves the forest canopy intact, helps sequester carbon, and creates a sustainable cycle for our raw materials.  On top of the environmental benefits, bamboo also happens to make a great ski core.  Bamboo has a tensile strength that rivals that of steel, and a very high coefficient of restitution, meaning that it will snap back to its’ original shape time after time.  That is why our skis have such an energetic, lively feel.   
Partners

We work with our partners because they are the best at what they do.  It is that simple.  We believe we make the best skis on the planet, and want our customers to have the best accessories to match their Liberty skis.  
Tyrolia makes our bindings, and they are the largest binding brand in the world, with unsurpassed quality, safety, and performance.  They are great at what they do, and listened to our requests for a new freeride style A/T binding with low ramp angle, pole control mode adjustment, and high DIN.  The Adrenalin is the best freeride A/T binding you can buy.   
Komperdell makes some of the most innovative and highest tech ski poles in the world.  We partnered with them to produce our super light bamboo and carbon fiber pole and a new adjustable A/T pole.  We don’t just make standard aluminum tubes, but specially-designed poles that each answers a specific need for our customers.   
Graphics

You won’t find wizards or pistols or fanciful unicorns on our skis, just original artwork by people who actually live in the mountains.  We work with our artists to create images that are evocative of the alpine experience, and that are also nice to look at when they emerge from the powder.  We sublimate or direct print the images into the backside of the topsheet to ensure the artwork looks good, year after year.  
Final Word

We appreciate all the support over the past many years.  We have had a lot of fun, and learned some things along the way.  We hope to see you in the mountains soon, and we hope you will continue to trust us to make equipment for those epic days when we feel most alive.  At Liberty, we make skis like our lives depend on them, because they do.  Thanks.

OPPORTUNITY


Liberty Skis
 Have you ever dreamed of working in the action sports industry? Although it is a lot of hard work, it is the best way to earn a living we have found, and it is how we live our lives whether we are getting paid for it or not. We freeze our hands turning screws in the snow, we stay up for 36 hours getting ready for trade shows, drive long distances, and constantly strive to get better at what we do, making great skis. However, we also get to test new powder ski designs, go to great events, travel, ski, and meet many of the amazing people in this industry. If this sounds like you, maybe there is a place for you at Liberty Skis.
Liberty Skis was started by a small group of riders with a set of ideas about both twin-tip and single-tip skis that perform at the highest level, and that also tread lightly on the planet.  Liberty was the first (and is still the only) ski company to use bamboo cores in every ski, and we lead the way by being the first ski company to use 100% windpower for all of our electricity needs. All of this is nice, but wouldn’t mean anything if our skis didn’t rip. They do. Just pick up any ski magazine, or ask anyone who rides Liberty.  There is a reason that we are most award-winningest independent ski company.
Many of our interns go on to careers in the action sports world, or just have a great time and an experience they won’t forget. A few even impressed us so much that we found positions for them here at Liberty. If you are hard-working, have a good sense of humor and understand what it means to be a skier, keep reading.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Free Binding Mounting











 




&nbsp





Yep, We Mount Your Bindings

We are happy to say that binding mounting is included in your purchase of any ski and binding on our website.

What is Binding Mounting?

If this is your first time buying skis and bindings you might not know what we are talking about. Ski bindings are mounted by literally drilling holes in to the proper position on skis based on your boot size (this is why we ask for information after checkout). Plenty of other places you can buy skis and bindings online don't mount the bindings for you and you will be left looking for a local shop to do it. Anyway, we hope you appreciate the service and here is a little more detailed information.


For Purchases Without Boots in the Order

If you are getting just skis and bindings you will be prompted for your boot or shoe size, if you have adjustable bindings this information is not necessary but you can still provide it. The bindings will still need to be adjusted to your boots by someone locally who can test the release of the bindings based upon the actual boots being used. This is a quick and usually inexpensive process; the difficult and expensive part is the mounting of the bindings.

For Purchases With Boots

If you also are buying a pair of boots, a longer form asking for the skier height, weight, age and ability level. This information allows us to adjust the bindings for the skier so that you can take the gear from the box to the slopes. This FREE service saves both time and money and we strongly suggest you take a chance on the best boot fit we have for you. Foreign orders which are difficult and expensive to return, therefore you should not guess with boot sizing. You should only buy what you are certain will fit.


Remember this form will be available AFTER checkout is complete. When you complete the form a copy will be emailed to you to verify that you entered the information correctly. Sometimes you may choose a ski/boot/binding package that is incompatible. If your package is incompatible we will notify you of suggested changes. If they are obvious and there is no color or price difference we will sometimes just make the change.
