			Trustee, The Estate of James Campbell (an organization that administered the assets held in trust under the will of James Campbell) from 1992 through 2016 (Chairman 1998, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016). Mr. Churchill served as COO and CEO of The Estate of James Campbell prior to becoming one of its Trustees. He also served as Controller, Financial Vice President, and President of Gaspro, Inc. and three years as a management consultant with Touche Ross & Co. Mr. Churchill serves as Chairman of Pacific Aviation Museum at Pearl Harbor and Challenger Center Hawaii. He received his bachelor of science degree in business and his M.B.A. in management and finance from the University of Arizona. Mr. Churchill's long association with the Estate of James Campbell (now the James Campbell Company LLC), a nationally diversified real estate company and a major Hawaii landowner, has given him a broad perspective on business affairs in the Company's core market as well as a deep knowledge of an industry that represents a large portion of our customer base. That perspective as well as Mr. Churchill's background in financial accounting led the Board to appoint him to its Audit & Risk Committee, which he chairs. Along with all of the other independent directors, Mr. Churchill also serves on the Board's Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee.
