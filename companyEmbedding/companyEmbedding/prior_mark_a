Remington Arms Class Action Settlement










            Frequently Asked Questions
        


BASIC INFORMATION

What is a Class Action?

    In a class action, one or more plaintiffs called “class representatives” sue one or more defendants on behalf of other people who allege similar claims. A
    court decides whether any lawsuit may proceed as a class action, and this Court has not finally decided that the lawsuit may be certified as a class
    action. All of these people with claims, together, are the “Settlement Class” or “Settlement Class Members” if the Court approves this procedure. Then,
    that Court resolves the issues for all Settlement Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the Settlement Class.




What is this class action about?

    This class action lawsuit claims that trigger mechanisms with a component part known as a trigger connector are defectively designed and can result in
    accidental discharges without the trigger being pulled. Defendants deny Plaintiffs’ allegations that the design of the firearm is defective. The lawsuit
    further contends that the value and utility of these firearms have been diminished as a result of these alleged defects. Defendants deny Plaintiffs’
    allegations that the value and utility of these firearms have been diminished. The Parties agreed to resolve these matters before these issues were decided
    by the Court.
	

    The lawsuit further claims that from May 1, 2006 to April 9, 2014, the X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism assembly process created the potential for the
    application of an excess amount of bonding agent, which could cause Model 700 or Seven rifles containing such trigger mechanisms to discharge without a
    trigger pull under certain limited conditions. Remington has undertaken a voluntary Product Safety Recall, which has been ongoing for more than a year, to
    address this issue.
	

    This Settlement does not involve claims of personal injury or property damage.
	



What Court is in charge of this Class Action Settlement?

    The Court in charge of the Settlement is the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, Kansas City Division. The name of the
    lawsuit is Pollard v. Remington Arms Co., LLC, et al., Case No. 4:13-cv-00086-ODS (W.D. Mo.).
	



Why is the class action being settled?

    Both sides in the lawsuit agreed to a settlement so that the Settlement Class Members can get benefits, to avoid the cost and risk of further litigation,
    including a potential trial, and in exchange for releasing Defendants from liability. The settlement does not mean that Defendants broke any laws and/or
    did anything wrong, and the Court did not decide which side was right.
	

    The settlement here has been preliminarily approved by the Court. The Class Representatives and the lawyers representing them (called “Class Counsel”)
    believe that the settlement is in the best interests of all Class Members.
	



Why are these firearms being recalled?

Only Model 700 and Model Seven rifles with X-Mark Pro triggers manufactured from May 1, 2006, to April 9, 2014, have been recalled.
    Models 700, Seven, Sportsman 78, and 673 with a Remington Walker trigger mechanism that utilizes a trigger connector, and Models 710, 715, 770, 600, 660,
	XP-100, 721, 722, and 725 with a Remington trigger mechanism that utilizes a trigger connector have not been recalled. While Plaintiffs’ economic-loss
    claims related to those models are being settled through this class action settlement, those firearms are not being recalled.
	



What is the “XMP Product Safety Recall”?

    Remington has determined that some Model 700 and Model Seven rifles with X-Mark Pro triggers manufactured from May 1, 2006, to April 9, 2014, could, under
    certain circumstances, unintentionally discharge. A Remington investigation has determined that some X-Mark Pro triggers might have excess
    bonding agent used in the assembly process. While Remington has the utmost confidence in the design of the X-Mark Pro trigger, it is undertaking a Product
    Safety Recall in the interest of consumer safety to replace these triggers with new X-Mark Pro triggers.
	


WARNING:
        IF YOU HAVE A REMINGTON RIFLE THAT FITS THIS DESCRIPTION, STOP USING YOUR FIREARM. Any unintended discharge has the potential to cause injury
        or death. Immediately cease use of your firearm. DO NOT attempt to diagnose or repair your firearm.
    


    Please note that both this settlement and the Product Safety Recall entitle current owners of these firearms who have not already participated in the
    Product Safety Recall to have their old X-Mark Pro trigger retrofitted with a new X-Mark Pro trigger. However, the Product Safety Recall does not provide
    for any other benefit provided in the settlement. Current owners of rifles subject to the Product Safety Recall may still participate in this settlement.
    Visit http://xmprecall.remington.com for additional details about the Product Safety Recall.
	



Is my firearm unsafe? Do I need to stop using my firearm?

	Model 700 and Model Seven rifles with X-Mark Pro triggers manufactured from May 1, 2006, to April 9, 2014, could, under certain limited circumstances,    unintentionally discharge. A Remington investigation has determined that some X-Mark Pro triggers might have excess bonding agent used in
    the assembly process. While Remington has the utmost confidence in the design of the X-Mark Pro trigger, it has undertaken a Product Safety Recall in the
    interest of consumer safety to replace these triggers with new X-Mark Pro triggers.
	

WARNING:
        IF YOU HAVE A REMINGTON RIFLE THAT FITS THIS DESCRIPTION, STOP USING YOUR FIREARM. Any unintended discharge has the potential to cause injury
        or death. Immediately cease use of your firearm. DO NOT attempt to diagnose or repair your firearm.

    documents located under the “Important Documents” section of the website.

How are lawyers for Class members paid?

    The lawyers who represent the Settlement Classes will ask the Court for reimbursement of their out-of-pocket expenses and an award of attorneys’ fees and
    costs based on their work in this litigation in an amount not to exceed $12.5 million. The amount of attorneys’ fees to be awarded will be determined
    solely by the Court. The amount of the award will in large part be based on the amount of time spent by the lawyers litigating this case since 2012. The
    Court must approve any request for fees, expenses and costs. These payments of legal fees and expenses will not reduce the value of the Settlement benefits
    made available to Settlement Class Members. Defendants will also separately pay the costs to provide notice of and to administer the Settlement.
	



Will the Class representatives who have worked with the lawyers receive any extra payment?

    Yes. To compensate them for the work in this litigation, Class Counsel will ask the Court for an incentive award in the amount of $2,500 for each class
    representative. These payments will not reduce the value of the Settlement benefits made available to Settlement Class Members.
	



What if I do not want to participate in the Settlement?

    The only way NOT to be a settlement class member is to opt out of the Settlement. See the Class Notice on the home page of this website for further details
    about how to opt out and deadline for opting out of the settlement.
	



What if I do not like the Settlement, can I tell the Court I do not like the Settlement?

    Yes. If you are a Settlement Class Member, and you don’t exclude yourself from the Settlement Classes, you can object to the Settlement if you don’t like
    some part of it. You can give reasons why you think the Court should not approve it. The Court will consider your views but may approve the Settlement
    anyway. See the Class Notice on the home page of this website for further details about how to object and deadline for objecting.
	



What is the difference between opting out of (or excluding yourself from) the Settlement and objecting to the Settlement?

    Opting out or excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don’t want to be part of the Class. If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object
    because the Settlement no longer affects you. Objecting is telling the Court that you don’t like something about the Settlement. You can only object if you
    stay in a Settlement Class.
	

    If you are a Settlement Class Member and you do nothing, you will remain a Settlement Class Member and all of the Court’s orders will apply to you, you
    will be eligible for the Settlement benefits as long as you satisfy the conditions for receiving each benefit, and you will not be able to sue Defendants
    over the issues in the lawsuit.
	



When and where will the Court decide whether to approve or not approve the settlement?

    A fairness hearing seeking final approval will be held on December 14, 2015, at 1:00 pm. Central, in Courtroom 8C, Charles Evans Whittaker Courthouse, 400
    E. Ninth Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.
	



What if the Court rejects the settlement and final approval is never ordered by the court?

    Individuals with a Model 700 or Seven with an X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism manufactured from May 1, 2006 to April 9, 2014, are still entitled to a retrofit
    pursuant to the terms of the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall.
	

    All other relief (Model 770 connectorless retrofits, other X-Mark Pro retrofits, voucher relief, refunds for previous X-Mark Pro retrofits, safety DVDs)
    will not be provided. The website will be updated if the settlement is not approved. If you have submitted your claim before that time, you will be
    notified if final approval is not achieved.

THE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS—WHAT YOU GET AND HOW TO GET IT


What benefits are available to Settlement class members?

    If you are a Settlement Class Member, what you are eligible to receive depends on several factors, including the model and trigger mechanism of your

    under the new assembly process at no cost to the Settlement Class Member. Settlement Class Members can choose either to take their firearm to the RARC for
    the retrofit or to ship their firearm to the RARC for the retrofit. If they choose to ship their firearm, Remington will send the Settlement Class Member
    pre-paid shipping tags, boxes, and written instructions. A current list of Remington Authorized Repair Centers can be found on the Settlement Website or by

    Members will be provided with voucher codes redeemable for products at Remington’s online store. A voucher code for Remington products in the amount of
    $12.50 will be provided to Settlement Class Members who own a Model 600, 660, or XP-100, which were manufactured between 1962 and 1982. These voucher codes
    are transferable, may be combined with other Remington coupons or vouchers, and do not expire. Settlement Class Members are not required to return their
    firearm(s) to Remington in order to receive a voucher code. Settlement Class Members must first timely submit a Claim Form to be eligible for this benefit.
	
Current owners of Models 721, 722, and 725 with a Remington trigger mechanism that utilizes a trigger connector.
	
	
    These firearms were predominantly produced between 1948 and 1961 and cannot be readily retrofitted with a connectorless trigger mechanism. Settlement Class

    $10.00 will be provided to Settlement Class Members who own a Model 721, 722, or 725, which were manufactured from 1948 to 1961. These voucher codes are
    transferable, may be combined with other Remington coupons or vouchers, and do not expire. Settlement Class Members are not required to return their
    firearm(s) to Remington in order to receive a voucher code. Settlement Class Members must first timely submit a Claim Form to be eligible for this benefit.
	
Current owners of Models 700 and Seven containing an X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism manufactured from May 1, 2006 to April 9, 2014 that have not been
    repaired as part of the voluntary Product Safety Recall prior to April 14, 2015.
	
	
    A Remington Authorized Repair Center will remove the existing X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism and retrofit the firearm with an X-Mark Pro manufactured under
    the new assembly process at no cost to the Settlement Class Member. Settlement Class Members can choose either to take their firearm to the RARC for the
    retrofit or to ship their firearm to the RARC for the retrofit. If they choose to ship their firearm, Remington will send the Settlement Class Member
    pre-paid shipping tags, boxes, and written instructions. A current list of Remington Authorized Repair Centers can be found on the Settlement Website or by
    calling the Settlement Phone Number. Settlement Class Members must first submit a timely Claim Form to be eligible for this benefit.
	

NOTE:
    These models are the subject of a voluntary Product Safety Recall (see https:/. Both this Settlement and the Product Safety Recall entitle current owners
    of these firearms to have their old X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism retrofitted with a new X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism. However, the Product Safety Recall
    does not provide for any other benefit described herein. Current owners of rifles subject to the Product Safety Recall may still participate in this
    Settlement. Due to the ongoing Product Safety Recall, the trigger mechanism retrofit for these models is currently available to these Settlement Class
    Members, and Settlement Class Members do not need to wait until the Effective Date to receive this benefit.
	
Current and former owners of Model 700 and Seven rifles who replaced at their own cost their rifle’s original Walker trigger mechanism with an X-Mark
    Pro trigger mechanism manufactured from May 1, 2006 to April 9, 2014.
	
	
    In addition to the retrofit, current and former owners of Model 700 and Seven rifles who replaced their firearm’s original Walker trigger mechanism at
    their own cost with an X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism manufactured from May 1, 2006 to April 9, 2014, may also seek a refund of the amount of money they paid
    for the replacement. The Settlement Class Member must first fully and timely execute the Claim Form and any requested documentation. Refunds shall not
    exceed $119, which represents the most that Remington has ever charged for an X-Mark Pro installation in Model 700 or Model Seven rifles originally
    containing a Walker trigger mechanism. Refunds will be batch mailed four times per year.
	
All Settlement Firearms.
	
	
    In addition to the benefits described above, all Settlement Class Members who timely execute the Claim Form will be provided with an educational DVD
    regarding safe firearm handling practices.
	



How do I receive the settlement benefits?

    You must submit a Claim Form to receive benefits. If you do nothing, you will not receive benefits from the Settlement. If you do nothing, you will still

    Settlement benefits are only available for current residents or citizens of the United States and its territories. You must have a U.S. shipping address in
    order to mail your firearm to Remington for a retrofit.
	



Do I have to submit my claim form electronically?

    No. You may print a copy of the claim form attached here and submit it to the mailing address or e-mail address shown on the claim
    form.
	



May I submit a claim for more than one firearm?

    You may submit a claim for each qualifying firearm that you own. However, you must submit a separate claim form (electronically or in hard copy) for each
    firearm. Only one serial number is permitted per claim form.
	



How do I find my firearm's serial number?

    The firearm’s serial number is located where the barrel meets the receiver (for a right-handed rifle, the serial number is located on a user’s left, and
    for a left-handed rifle, the serial number is located on a user’s right).





 What if I am entitled to a retrofit pursuant to the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall, but I do not want to participate in the settlement? Instead, I
    only want to participate in the recall?

    You may visit xmprecall.remington.com to request a new X-Mark Pro trigger under the recall. However, the only way NOT to be a settlement class
    member is to opt out of the settlement. See the Notice for further details about how to opt out.
	



 What if I already had my firearm retrofitted with a new X-Mark Pro trigger as part of the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall?

    If you participated in the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall before April 14, 2015, you are not included in the settlement and are not entitled to any
    further benefits. If you participated in the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall after April 14, 2015, you are still a settlement class member unless you opt
    out.
	



 When can I get my firearm retrofitted?

    If you are part of the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall class, you are entitled to a retrofit as soon as your claim is filed and you receive your Ticket
    ID#. If you are not part of the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall class, you will not be able to receive a retrofit until after the court issues an order
    finally approving the settlement and any appeals are resolved in favor of the settlement. If you have submitted your claim before that time, you will be
    notified if final approval is achieved.
	



 What do I do with the Ticket ID# included on the e-mail I received after I submitted my claim?

    The Ticket ID# is how your claim will be identified in Remington’s system. If you call Angeion with a question, you will be asked for your Ticket ID#. If
    you wish to check the status of your retrofit on the settlement website, you will be asked to input your Ticket ID#. If you have chosen to take your
    firearm to a Remington Authorized Repair Center for a retrofit, please take your Ticket ID# with you. Note, however, the fact that
    you have a Ticket ID# does not mean you are entitled to a retrofit at this time. If you are part of the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall class, you are
    entitled to a retrofit as soon as your claim is filed and you receive your Ticket ID#. If you are not part of the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall class,
    you will not be able to receive a retrofit until after the court issues an order finally approving the settlement and any appeals are resolved in favor of
    the settlement. If you have submitted your claim before that time, you will be notified if final approval is achieved.
	



How do I check the status of the retrofit of my firearm?

    There is a link on the home page of this website that will enable you to check the status of your firearm online. Click on the page “Track Retrofit.”
	



 Besides the retrofit, how do I get the other relief I am entitled to under the settlement?

    Fill out your claim form and submit it. If final approval is ordered by the court, Angeion will distribute other relief (safety DVDs, voucher codes and/or
    refund checks) thereafter. If you have submitted your claim before the date of final approval, you will be notified if final approval is achieved.
	



I own a Model 710, 715 or 770. Why can I not have my firearm retrofitted at an RARC?

    The RARCs are not equipped to retrofit these firearms, which require a different type of retrofit. All of these firearms must be retrofitted at Remington’s
    factory in Ilion, New York.
	



I own a Model 600, 660, XP-100, 721, 722 or 725. Why can I not get my firearm retrofitted?

    These models are typically quite old and are not conducive to a retrofit. Instead, you are entitled to a voucher code for use on the Remington website.
	



I have chosen to take my firearm to a Remington Authorized Repair Center (“RARC”) to have it retrofitted. When can I take in my firearm?

    The notification you received after you filled out your claim form should tell you whether your benefits are available now or not until after final
    approval. If you are part of the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall class, you are entitled to a retrofit as soon as you file a claim and receive a Ticket
    ID# (which will be included in the e-mail you receive after your claim is submitted). If you are not part of the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall class,
    you will not be entitled to a retrofit until after the court issues an order finally approving the settlement, even though you will receive a Ticket ID# as
    soon as your claim is submitted. If you have submitted your claim before the date of final approval, you will be notified if final approval is achieved.
	



 I have chosen to take my firearm to a RARC, but I received instructions from Remington on how to mail in my firearm. Why?

    Remington’s system auto-generates shipping instructions for all firearms it will service at one of its facilities. If, when submitting your claim, you
    elected to walk your firearm into an RARC for service, you can ignore the shipping instructions automatically sent by Remington’s system. You may keep the
    box you received.
	



 When I take my firearm to the RARC, what do I need to take with me?

    Take your unloaded firearm as well as a copy of the e-mail notification you received after you submitted your claim. The e-mail notification will contain
    your Ticket ID#.
	



How can I figure out where the closest Remington Authorized Repair Center is to me?

    There is a list of Remington Authorized Repair Centers attached to the home page of this website. If, when filling out your claim form, you opted to take
    your firearm to the nearest RARC (instead of having your firearm shipped there), you may choose the RARC to which you want to take your firearm.
	



I have chosen to ship my firearm to Remington (for Models 710, 715 and 770) or to a Remington Authorized Repair Center (for Models 673, 700, Seven, and
    Sportsman 78). I have submitted my claim and received my Ticket ID#. Now what?

    If you are part of the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall class, after you submit your claim, Remington will automatically send you shipping materials and
    instructions. That will occur as quickly as possible. If you are not part of the X-Mark Pro Product Safety Recall class, after you submit your claim, you
    will receive an e-mail confirmation and a Ticket ID#. However, you will not be entitled to a retrofit until after the court issues an order finally
    approving the settlement. If you have submitted your claim before the date of final approval, you will be notified if final approval is achieved. After
    final approval, Remington will automatically send shipping materials and instructions to you—you need not do anything further to receive them. For Models
    673, 700, Seven, and Sportsman 78, Remington will choose the RARC to which your firearm is shipped.
	



I have been notified that Remington has deemed my firearm irreparably unsafe. What can I do?

    Your firearm cannot be retrofitted. If you disagree with Remington’s conclusion, you may appeal to a neutral third party who has been approved by the
    court. Please call Angeion at 1-800-876-5940 for further details.
	



I have been notified by Remington that my firearm requires further maintenance. What can I do?

    The notification you received from Remington will state what further maintenance it believes is required and what steps you may take to have such
    maintenance completed. If you disagree with Remington’s conclusion, you may appeal to a neutral third party who has been approved by the court. Please call
    Angeion at 1-800-876-5940 for further details.
	



 How do I get a refund of the money I previously paid to have my firearm’s original Walker fire control replaced with an X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism?

    You can make that request on your claim form. If you paid Remington for the replacement, no further documentation needs to be provided. If you paid a third
    party, you must print a copy of the “Refund Request Form,” complete it, and return it to Angeion with either a copy of your receipt showing the cost of the
    repair or a completed attestation signed by you and an individual qualified to make rifle repairs.
	



 I participated in the bolt-lock safety program. Can I get back the money I spent under that program?

    No. The costs associated with that program were for maintenance unrelated to the X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism. If an X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism happened
    to be installed during the course of that program, the customer was not charged for it.
	



What if my firearm contains an after-market trigger made by another company?

    Your firearm is not covered by the settlement. Only firearms containing a Remington Walker trigger mechanism, a Remington trigger mechanism with a trigger
    connector, or an X-Mark Pro trigger mechanism manufactured between May 1, 2006 and April 9, 2014, are covered by the settlement.
	


GETTING ADDITIONAL OR MORE INFORMATION


 Are more details about the Settlement and my rights under the Settlement available?

    This website summarizes the Settlement and your rights under the Settlement. It cannot tell you every right to which you may be entitled. To obtain further
    information or advice about your legal rights, you may contact Class Counsel or consult a lawyer at your own expense.
	

    More details about the terms of the Settlement are set forth in the Settlement Agreement. If you have questions or want to know more about the Settlement,
    you can contact the Claims Administrator or Class Counsel.

Automated Part Marking

With a team of mechanical, electrical and software engineers in-house, Pryor specialises in developing automated marking solutions.
Robotic control is integrated directly into Pryor software so that robot moves can be programmed as steps in the marking process. As no expert knowledge or PLC programming is necessary to implement a robotic system, it can be done faster and cheaper.
Conveyors, feed systems and fixturing can all be integrated into marking systems either using our own design capabilities or incorporating your existing systems. 

Marking controlled by vision

Pryor 's expertise in vision systems is unmatched in the marking industry. Our own range of vision products can now be used to guide robots and custom automated solutions. Thus, the markings are executed automatically at predefined locations.
Operator errors can be completely removed from the marking process by placing and verifying the location of the markings according to the characteristics of the components.
Our light covers, barcode scans and inputs identification (RFID ) can be used to trigger the marking process automatically. The marked data can be entered from databases, spreadsheets or vision systems, which ensures that the marking is performed quickly and without errors.

Printing On Metal - Plug and Play

Pryor's simplest marking machines are easy to set up and use for printing on metal. They feature a USB connection to your PC and an intuitive layout editor.
The dot marking machines can be operated like a printer for metal surfaces, ideal for printing metal labels, tags or small components with permanent marks.
The range includes a bench-top machine for smaller components and tags, and a hand-held machine for marking larger or harder to reach parts.
 

 Laser marking

If you need to mark other surfaces such as glass or plastic, a laser marking machine is suitable.
The laser marking can also provide a very fast and very contrasting mark for most metal surfaces.

Serial Number Marking

Putting a serial number onto a product is the most common application for permanent part marking. Whatever your product, the mark location or your budget, Pryor has an ideal solution.
Pryor's standard stand-alone embedded controller, available with all machines, features automatic serialisation. 
Serial numbers can be set for a specific mark layout, or globally across all marks made. The user can completely customise the length and format of the serial number, the increment and the frequency of the increment. For example, if the same serial number is to be marked on same part in 2 different places, the frequency of the increment would be every 2 marks.
Via the auto save feature, the serialisation will continue where it left off when the machine is turned off and on again.
Manual marking solutions provide a quick and easy way to apply a serial number. Numbering heads are designed specifically for the purpose and come in various versions to suit your application - manual increment, finger pawl for quick increment or powered for automatic increment.
Pryor Type and Punches can both be used as a simple way to mark numbers when marking infrequently or in small batches. 

Preventing duplication of serial numbers

The Pryor unique control software ensures that no two marked pieces can have the same serial number.
The serial numbers can easily be introduced into the labeling software from any source : analysis of a printed barcode, spreadsheet, database or complete PLC system.
The labeled serial numbers can be forwarded as a record of what has already been produced, then the associated manufacturing data for referencing.
The implementation of our multi- station network module can perform double checks on many machines, workstations and sites.

Trademarks: Frequently Asked Questions by 4Trademark.Com

















 FAQs
                (Frequently Asked Questions)



  What
                is a Trademark?

 Its
                a word, phrase, logo, symbol or design, or a combination of these
                elements, used to identify or distinguish the goods and services
                of one company or individual from others.

  What
                  does it mean "to Trademark"?

 When
                people say "you need to Trademark," they generally
                mean you need to file a Trademark application with the U.S. Patent
                and Trademark Office (USPTO). While mere use of the word or logo
                without registration is enough to create common law trademark
                ownership rights, those rights only extend to the geographical
                area where the mark is being used. A Federal Trademark registration
                is much stronger protection because it provides national protection.

  What
                  is a Service Mark?

 Legally,
                a Service Mark is a Trademark, however, Service Marks relate
                to services, while Trademarks can relate to either goods or services.

  When
                are the symbols "TM" , "SM" and "®" used?

 TM
                  SYMBOL: Parties
                  claiming rights to particular trademarks may use the symbol
                  TM next to their marks at any time - even prior to filing a
                  trademark application.
 SM
                    SYMBOL: A party claiming such right
                    to a Service Mark may similarly use either the TM or the
                    SM symbol. Registration is not necessary in order to use
                    these particular symbols.
 THE ® SYMBOL: The ® symbol
                indicates that the trademark is a valid U.S. federally registered
                trademark. It is generally not permissible to use the ® symbol
                in the U.S. unless you have a valid U.S. federally registered
                trademark. Additionally, merely filing a trademark application
                is not enough, one must wait until the trademark successfully
                completes the entire registration process before using the ® symbol.

  Do
                  I need an attorney to apply for registration of a Trademark?

 No.  You
                are not required to use an attorney to prepare your trademark
                application.  4Trademark.com processes hundreds of trademark
                applications per year.  We offer low cost, fixed fee professional
                services - our charge starts at $350.00 to prepare a single trademark
                application. Most attorneys charge an hourly fee and require
                a retainer.  Moreover, unless the attorney is experienced
                in this process, you may have to pay him/her to learn to how
                to register a trademark!

  How
                  long does it take to secure a Federal Trademark?

 It
                generally takes 10-16 months to secure a final registration certificate
                from the USPTO. However, assuming you eventually secure the registration
                for your trademark, your protection starts as of the date of
                filing, not the date of issue. Thus, you do not need to wait
                for a final registration certificate before you begin to use
                your trademark in interstate commerce.

 
  What
                  is the difference between State and Federal Trademarks?

 Trademarks
                  may be filed at either the state or federal level. State trademarks
                  protect your mark in a specific state while federal trademarks
                  normally protect your mark in all the states. State trademarks
                  generally provide far less legal protection than federal trademarks.
                  Businesses operating in only one state should trademark in
                  that state. However, businesses operating in interstate
                  commerce may file
                  for a federal trademark. Obviously, a business intent on expanding
                  nationally or internationally should conduct a trademark search
                  and file a federal trademark as soon as possible.

  What
                  is Interstate Commerce?

 To
                secure a federal trademark you must be conducting business in
                Interstate Commerce. This means you must be (i) conducting business
                across state lines which means doing business in two or more
                states; or, (ii) conducting business internationally which means
                between at least one U.S. state and one foreign country. Additionally,
                simply having a web site is not generally considered "conducting
                business." More appropriately, "conducting business" should
                be interpreted to mean making an actual sale of your good or
                service.
 Businesses
                such as local businesses who are not conducting business in Interstate
                Commerce should file for a state trademark because they are not
                yet eligible for a federal trademark. The one exception to this
                if you intend to conduct business in Interstate Commerce in the
                near future. In such instance, it may be appropriate to file
                an Intent to Use federal trademark application.  Federal
                Intent to Use applications are effectively name reservations
                pending future use.

  Do
                  I have to be currently using a trademark in order to file?

 No.
                If you are using the Trademark in interstate commerce you can
                file an "Actual Use" application and provide the date
                of first use. Such use must be actual, and not merely the advertisement
                or promotion of the mark prior to the availability of the product
                or service for which the mark is being used.
 If
                you have a bona fide "intent to use" the mark in interstate
                commerce but have not yet begun to use the mark then you can
                file and "Intent to Use" application. While the costs
                associated with these filing these two types of trademark applications
                are identical, the "intent to use" applicant must later
                file a Statement of Use together with an additional filing fee
                of $100 per Class. This statement of use will notify the USPTO
                and the world of your actual date of first use when and if you
                use the mark in interstate commerce.

  What
                  is a common law trademark?

 Mere
                use of a trademark in interstate commerce is enough to create
                a common law trademark if the trademark is distinctive and has
                created a "secondary meaning." Common law trademarks
                should used with either the TM or SM symbol to notify the world
                of the owner's intent to protect his or her trademark rights
                in a particular mark. Please note that while the common law does
                afford the trademark owner some minimum level of trademark protection
                it should not be considered a valid alternative to the federally
                registered trademark which offers the greatest protection.

  Should
                  I file a federal trademark if I have common law rights?

 Yes.
                A federal trademark establishes a presumption of ownership in
                a court of law. Owners of common law trademarks have to prove
                they use and own the trademark - sometimes on a county-by-county
                basis. This can be expensive and time consuming to prove in court.
                Financially, the only one who benefits would be the lawyers.

  Who
                May File an Application to Register a Trademark?

 Any
                person, corporation or partnership may apply. You shorten the
                procedure by using 4Trademark.com to guide you through the process:
                the many kinds of marks you can use, what is available at a state
                and federal level, and what may be best for your particular business.

  What
                is the benefit of a trademark search?

 It
                is important to know the full extent of the use of your mark
                prior to filing. Our Comprehensive Search includes a search of
                the federal database, the state databases, the common law database
                as well as the Internet Domain Name database. Click here for
                specific information regarding trademark searches.
 Note,
                  if your trademark has already been federally registered then
                  you will not be able to register your trademark federally for
                  the same or similar goods and services. If your mark is already
                  being used in interstate
                  commerce (i.e., a
                  common law mark) you must determine the full extent of the
                  use - especially if you want unrestricted national trademark
                  protection. Your rights only extend to "after-users." If
                  someone used it before you, then your rights are limited to
                  the extent they have already used it.

  What
                if some other company is  already using my trademark?

 If
                both companies offer the same or similar goods and services,
                and the other company has already registered the trademark federally,
                then you are likely out of luck. It may be best to find another
                name to trademark. If they have not trademarked, but they used
                the name first and they use the name nationally and pervasively,
                then you are probably still out of luck depending on the scope
                of their use. However, if they only use the trademark on a local
                basis, then you may be able to register the trademark federally
                and use it in those areas where they do not and have not used
                it before.
 Example: Lets
                assume they have a trademark in California and have only ever
                done business in California. You can still register the trademark
                at the federal level and use it nationally. However, you cannot
                use it in the State of California.

  If
                  my trademark search shows a valid registered trademark but
                  the owner of the trademark is no longer using the mark, can
                  I still file?

 Not
                if the owner has assigned or sold the trademark to another party
                or if the trademark is only not being used on a temporary basis.
                However, if the company is no longer using the trademark and
                has not been using the trademark for a substantial period of
                time (generally 2-3 years) then you may be able to successfully
                challenge their mark in court. Because of this they may be interested
                in selling the trademark to you inexpensively. But be warned,
                the minute you contact them they may immediately start using
                the mark!

  Can
                  I register a trademark in the U.S. if I live outside
                  the U.S.?

 Yes.
                However, if an applicant does not reside in U.S., a representative
                in the U.S. must be designated to receive documents and correspondence.
                We can act as your Domestic Representative at no charge through
                the date of registration.

 
 How
              do I file for an International trademark?

 Normally,
                trademarks are filed and registered on a country-by-country basis.
                Clearly, this can be very expensive. The good news is that recently
                some common filings, i.e., one filing protects you in multiple
                countries, are now available and will likely save you both in
                terms of time and money. While this is a great benefit to you
                from a cost standpoint there are some risks as well. You need
                to consult a professional regarding the risks of these common
                filings. One such common filing is in Europe. It is now possible
                to register one trademark with many of the countries in the European
                Union and secure protection throughout the majority of Europe.
                Additionally, you can now also file pursuant to the Madrid Agreement.
                The Madrid Protocol is the largest worldwide common filing allowing
                U.S. Registrants to register their trademark in more than 50
                different countries throughout the world. For more information
                on filing internationally please contact Richard Morris at Richard@4trademark.com.

 If
                  I register a specific name as a trademark, will I be able to
                  prevent its use by everyone else in the world?

 No.
                If you own a registered trademark you can prevent others from
                using the same or similar trademark only for those goods and/or
                services you sell. For example, if you sell T-shirts using a
                registered trademark you have the right to prevent others from
                selling T-shirts using a trademark which is the same or similar
                to your trademark. Also, others may use your trademark to sell
                unrelated goods - like car tires or bottled water. You would
                only be protected for T-shirts.
 Additionally,
                federal trademark protection only extends to companies selling
                goods or services in the U.S. or between a foreign country and
                the U.S. Your competitors may still have the right to sell the
                same or similar goods or services between 2 or more foreign countries.
                For this reason, many companies register their trademarks internationally
                as well.

  Can
                  I trademark my name and logo together in one application?

 No.
                Each trademark must be trademarked separately if you intend to
                use them separately. Your name, slogan, logo, Domain name and
                design are all separate trademarks. Moreover, your business name
                and your logo are separate trademarks even if your business name
                is incorporated within the logo. Additionally, each application
                will incur its own fees and costs.

  Can
                  I trademark my Domain name?

 Yes,
                however, your Domain name must be used to identify or distinguish
                your goods and services from others. Using it as simply your
                Domain Address is not usually not enough. Using your Domain name
                as your business name, for example, will make registration easier.

  Do
                  I pay annual fees to maintain my trademark?

 No
                additional filings or fees are due within the first five years
                of ownership. The first renewal is due between the fifth and

  Can
                I register a descriptive word as my trademark?

 Yes,
                if you use it as a trademark (i.e., as a business name or product
                name) and you do not use it in a generic sense.  Here are
                some rules for using your somewhat descriptive trademark:
 1.
                Use the trademark as a proper adjective.

2.
                    Stylize the trademark when used in text (e.g. bold face,
                    initial capital letters, italics, colors).

3.
                    Use the trademark with appropriate warnings such as the "TM" symbol
                    or language which says "This mark is a trademark registered
                    in Texas."

4.
                    Never alter a trademark - use it a single way exactly as
                    it is trademarked.  Do not use it as a verb.  Do
                    not pluralize a trademark that was trademarked in the singular.

5.
                    Manage the use of your trademark by other market participants.  Require
                    your clients, licensees and competitors to say "Registered
                    trademark of ABC, Inc." if they wish to use your trademark.

6.
                    Enforce your trademark.  Quickly react to the improper
                    use of a trademark by sending "cease and desist letters" or
                    by explaining the proper use of your mark.

Innovations in mobility and communication, notably Internet sales and online mobile applications, afford manufacturers and merchants novel ways to launch new trademarks. Companies are no longer limited to affixing a mark directly on a product or its packaging to support a finding of trademark use in commerce. Moreover, the use of trademarks on the Internet in association with the sale of products and the provision of services has extended traditional concepts of trademark use beyond geographic boundaries. In jurisdictions that maintain strong trademark use requirements, such as the United States and Canada, it is, therefore, important for foreign applicants to ensure that the manner in which their marks are used will support a finding of use in commerce with their goods and/or services. 

United States 
Trademark rights in the United States stem from use, rather than registration. Indeed, since a federal trademark registration does not generally issue without showing real use of the mark in the ordinary course of trade, questions concerning how a trademark applicant can establish use are important. 15 USC § 1127. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and U.S. courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly, so as to encompass various genuine, but less traditional, trademark uses. 

Test Markets and Sample Sales 
It is becoming more and more common for a manufacturer or merchant to promote the sale of its product or service well before even a “beta” version is available to the public. In the United States, a trademark applicant may not file a trademark application claiming actual use of the mark if the use was merely pre-sale advertising or promotion of the goods or services. Era Corp. v. Electronic Realty Associates, Inc., 211 U.S.P.Q. 734, 745 (T.T.A.B. 1981), cited in Cake Divas v. Charmaine Jones, Opposition No. 91177301 (T.T.A.B. Feb. 23, 2010) (not precedential). 

The rules change, however, where two parties dispute which has priority. In the United States, “use analogous to trademark use,” including advertising campaigns to announce the launch of a new product, or taking orders for a product that will soon be on the market, can sometimes be “tacked” onto actual use for the purposes of establishing priority. The key is that the trademark owner must show this kind of prior use created an association in the minds of the purchasing public between the mark and the goods. T.A.B. Systems v. PacTel Teletrac, 77 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1996). 

The issue is more complex with the promotion of a service mark. In Aycock Engineering, Inc. v. Airflite, Inc., 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the use in commerce requirement is not met when an applicant uses a service mark in the preparatory stages of a service’s development but never offers the service to the public. The court observed that the Trademark Act “makes plain that advertisement and actual use of the mark in commerce are required; mere preparations to use a mark in commerce are insufficient to constitute use in commerce. Rather, the mark must be actually used in conjunction with the services described in the application for the mark.” The court thus held that the application was void ab initio. 

Pharmaceutical trademarks, however, present the classic example of special circumstances, given the market realities within the pharmaceutical industry. A pharmaceutical product cannot be sold commercially without approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; however, before the drug is put on the market, it will undergo clinical trials and testing that are very much a part of ordinary business. 

Indeed, the House Judiciary Committee noted that 

… “the ordinary course of trade” varies from industry to industry. Thus…a pharmaceutical company that markets a drug to treat a rare disease will make...a few sales in the ordinary course of its trade; the company’s shipment to clinical investigators during the Federal approval process will also be in its ordinary course of trade…. 

H.R. Rep. No. 1028, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1988). Thus, U.S. courts have indicated that shipping a drug to a clinical investigator for use in clinical trials during the Food and Drug Administration approval process can constitute use sufficient to file a trademark application with the USPTO. See G.D. Searle & Co. v. Nutrapharm, Inc., No. 98-6890 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 29, 1999). 

This understanding has been consistently upheld by U.S. courts. In Automedx, Inc. v. Artivent Corp., 95 U.S.P.Q.2d 1976 (T.T.A.B. 2010), the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board held that the sale of medical ventilators for testing, and before the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the ventilators for human use, was a bona fide sale for a legitimate commercial purpose. 

Unlawful Use 
Although the Board in Automedx held that use of a mark in association with the sale of a medical device, before the FDA approved it for commercial sale, was trademark “use,” trademark applicants should tread lightly in grounding trademark rights on sales of products and services that have not yet crossed all legal hurdles. As a general rule, use of a mark must be legal use to establish trademark rights. This principle would clearly apply, for instance, if the goods or services were themselves illegal—such as an application to register a mark for use on illicit drugs. In such cases, U.S. courts will generally apply the unlawful use doctrine preventing a trademark owner from securing trademark rights from unlawful sales of goods or services. 

A recent case involving the unlawful use doctrine is ZAO Gruppa Predpriyatij Ost v. Vosk International Co. (Opposition No. 91168423 (T.T.A.B. Aug. 9, 2011)). The defendant in that case alleged that the opposer’s use of its trademark on soft drinks was unlawful because its labels violated FDA regulations. The Board, however, maintained a narrow application of the doctrine. Trademark use would be considered unlawful under a regulatory act only if the issue of compliance was previously determined by a court or government agency having competent jurisdiction under the statute involved. ZAO Gruppa has recently been appealed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. 

Trademark “Use” and the Internet 
Use of trademarks on the Internet can raise questions concerning whether “use” has actually occurred at all and, if so, the territorial reach of the trademark rights. While mere advertising or promotion of a trademark on a web page is not “use in commerce,” a website page that displays the trademark, the product and a means to buy the product is considered to be “use in commerce.” See In re Sones, 590 F.3d 1282, 93 U.S.P.Q.2d 1118 (Fed. Cir. 2009). There must be a means of ordering the goods directly from the web page, such as a telephone number for placing orders or a pull-down menu for online ordering. In re Quantum Foods, Inc., 94 U.S.P.Q.2d 1375, 1380 (T.T.A.B. 2010). 

The question of a trademark’s territorial reach based on Internet use was recently considered in the case of Dudley v. HealthSource Chiropractic, Inc., No. 6:07-cv-6631 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 7, 2012). In this case, a federal court declined to grant a broad territorial reach based on common-law trademark use over the Internet. While the court was satisfied that the plaintiff was the senior user of the common-law trademark HEALTHSOURCE CHIROPRACTIC for chiropractic services, the plaintiff’s rights were limited to his use in the greater Rochester, New York, area. The judge reasoned, “The rights of concurrent users would be substantially harmed if one user were able to monopolize the internet to the exclusion of other lawful users of the same mark. If, as the Plaintiff suggests, a senior common law user could claim exclusive use on the internet, then it would undermine the benefits and security provided by federal registration.” 

Canada 
In Canada, the concept of trademark “use,” and therefore what constitutes “use,” is an important consideration when filing applications, when opposing another trader’s application and when seeking to maintain registrations once issued. However, the issue of what constitutes actual trademark “use” in Canada is not always clear, and there are some “gray” areas that can lead to difficult judgment calls. 

Test Markets and Sample Sales 
Generally, test shipments or sample sales do not constitute trademark “use” in Canada in the “ordinary course of trade,” and would not likely support a use-based application or an opposition claiming prior use, or provide a defense to a non-use attack. However, Canadian courts have, in some instances, acknowledged that sample shipments or test-marketing sales of products could constitute trademark use in the normal course of trade if it appears that test marketing is part of the normal business practice of the trademark owner and is done in advance of, or to further, sales in the normal course of trade. BFE, Inc. v. Broadcast Designs Ltd. (1993), 48 C.P.R. (3d) 240 (T.M.O.B.); Thomas J. Lipton Inc. v. Dial Corp. (1995), 61 C.P.R. (3d) 123 (T.M.O.B.); Fetherstonhaugh & Co. v. ConAgra Inc. (2002), 23 C.P.R. (4th) 49 (F.C.T.D.). 

The jurisprudence in this area is fairly fact- and industry-specific, and accordingly, trademark owners should exercise caution when relying on pre-market activities to support trademark use in Canada in the ordinary course of trade. For example, it is not clear whether use of a mark in clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry would constitute trademark use in the ordinary course of trade. While there are strong arguments in favor of this interpretation, relying on such use to support an application or registration is not without risk. 

Unlawful Use 
It is generally accepted that trademark use in Canada, whether to support a use-based application, to maintain a registration, or as a ground of opposition, must be a lawful use. McCabe v. Yamamoto & Co. (America) Inc. (1989), 23 C.P.R. (3d) 498 (F.C.T.D.). The Opposition Board has held, in several instances, that an application for registration of a trademark in Canada can be successfully opposed where the opponent has established a prima facie case that the applicant’s use of the mark was in violation of a federal statute. E. Remy Martin & Co., S.A. v. Magnet Trading Corp. (HK) Ltd. (1988), 23 C.P.R. (3d) 242 (T.M.O.B.); Co-operative Union of Canada v. Tele-Direct (Publications) Inc. (1991), 38 C.P.R. (3d) 263 (T.M.O.B.). 

Absent such prima facie evidence, however, an applicant is presumed to act legally. Hence, in Cadbury Confectionery Canada Inc. v. Valliant-Saunders ((2002), 22 C.P.R. (4th) 388 (T.M.O.B.)), use of the trademark CANNABIS CRUNCH was not prohibited in association with chocolate bars containing cannabis seeds, as it was established that certain types of cannabis seeds were legal and it was reasonable to assume that the applicant would comply with the law. 

Trademark Use and the Internet 
Use of trademarks on the Internet in cross-border and international commerce has had a significant impact on the concept of trademark use in Canada in the ordinary course of trade. Canadian courts increasingly have moved away from traditional notions of territoriality and trademark rights and have found various ancillary activities, many conducted via the Internet, to support a finding of trademark use in Canada. Doctor’s Associates Inc. v. American Multi-Cinema, Inc. (2012), 101 C.P.R. (4th) 253 (T.M.O.B.). 

Canadian courts have held that if a company responds to Canadian inquiries via its website, and/or displays the mark in its catalogues from which Canadian customers can order products, and/or are shipped products from the United States, such activity would constitute trademark “use” with “retail services” in Canada even without a “bricks and mortar” retail store in Canada, provided that there is at least some level of “interactivity” with potential customers in Canada. Lapointe Rosenstein LLP v. The West Seal, Inc., 2012 TMOB 114 (T.M.H.O.) (unreported); Saks & Co. v. Canada (Registrar of Trade Marks) (1989), 24 C.P.R. (3d) 49 (F.C.T.D.); McCarthy Tetrault v. Autozone Parts Inc. (2011), 93 C.P.R. (4th) 322 (T.M.O.B.). 

Similarly, “railway passenger services” was understood to include “train reservation and ticketing services,” without the actual operation of a train in Canada (Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, Inc. v. Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français SNCF (2000), 9 C.P.R. (4th) 443 (F.C.T.D.), aff’g (1995), 64 C.P.R. (3d) 87 (T.M.H.O.)), and use of a trademark for “reservation services” in Canada was held to support use of the mark for “automobile rental and leasing services” in Canada, even though the actual automobile rentals were not provided in Canada (Advantage Car & Truck Rentals v. Advantage Rent-A-Car Inc. (2003), 27 C.P.R. (4th) 342 (T.M.O.B.)). 

In the hotel industry, however, use of a mark in association with various ancillary services such as reservation services will not necessarily support trademark use with actual hotel accommodation services. In a 2006 decision of the Opposition Board, the concept of “hotel services” was interpreted broadly and the Board found that there was trademark “use” with “hotel services” based on the provision of reservation services, even without the presence of a hotel facility in Canada. Borden Ladner Gervais LLP v. WestCoast Hotels, Inc. (2006), 53 C.P.R. (4th) 361 (T.M.H.O.). However, in a November 2012 decision of the Opposition Board, the Hearing Officer distinguished the facts of the WestCoast decision and held that use of a mark merely with hotel reservation services did not constitute trademark “use” with hotel accommodation services. The decision may yet be appealed, which would clarify the issue in the hotel industry. Georgio Stamatis Maillis o/a Bellagio Limousines Against Registration Nos. TMA540,882 and TMA355,865 for the Trade-mark BELLAGIO in the Name of Mirage Resorts, Incorporated, 2012 TMOB 220. 

Summary 
With new ways of going to market and the increasing importance of the Internet in manufacturers’ marketing plans, traditional concepts of trademark “use” in commerce are being tested by courts in both Canada and the United States, often with surprisingly novel and flexible outcomes. Where there is a sufficient nexus between the trademark and the local consumer, use of the mark in other countries and via the Internet may support a claim to trademark use in Canada or the United States without an actual physical presence there. However, this very flexibility is leading to uncertainty in many industries as to what, exactly, constitutes “use” of a mark in commerce. It is increasingly important for foreign applicants to carefully evaluate the manner in which their marks are used, to ensure that such use will support a finding of actual trademark use.
