Today in funding: BuildDirect, Versant Venture Capital, Gallop Labs








 

More big financing news in Canada, with a big dose of cash foreshadowing future healthcare investment. Here’s the latest on who raised how much, from whom.
BuildDirect raises $50 million
Vancouver-based BuildDirect announced that it has raised $50 million in financing from Mohr Davidow Ventures, BDC Capital, Difference Capital Financial, OMERS Ventures, BMO Asset Management, and Scotia Institutional Asset Management, amongst others.
The company says it will use the money to rapidly expand and scale its Home Marketplace service, designed to connect home buyers and sellers.
“This financing underscores the speed at which old-world industries are breaking down and platform companies that leverage cutting-edge technology and data analytics, like BuildDirect, are putting the power in the hands of both the supply and demand side,” said Katherine Barr, General Partner, Mohr Davidow Ventures. “Home improvement is a half-trillion dollar industry and is severely fragmented and inefficient. BuildDirect is disrupting the existing supply chain in this industry and building a completely new, highly efficient and smart system that suppliers and consumers alike will benefit from tremendously in terms of manufacturing and distribution efficiencies for suppliers, and lower cost for high quality products and a much improved user experience for consumers.”
Versant Venture Capital V L.P. closes at $305M
Versant Venture Captial closed its Versant Venture Capital V L.P. at $305 million USD, with significant support from Canadian investors such as the Business Development Bank of Canada, Fonds de solidarité FTQ, Northleaf Venture Catalyst Fund, and Teralys Capital. The Versant V L.P. exceeded the V.C.’s target size by over $50 million.
Versant has indicated that the V portfolio will feature investments across the healthcare sector, with a specific focus on Canadian opportunities.
“We are witnessing significant changes in the way innovative products are developed and financed,” said Brad Bolzon, Versant’s Managing Director. “Versant’s investment strategy in Canada will involve more collaborative models that unite entrepreneurs, investors and industry partners to advance important therapies. As one of our first investments from the new fund, Northern Biologics exemplifies this approach.”
Gallop Labs raises $2 million
Toronto-based Gallop Labs announced an impressive $2 million seed round, led by Golden Venture Partners and Mantella Venture Partners, with Allen Lau, CEO of Wattpad, Albert Lai, CEO of Big Viking Games, Jennifer Lum, Founder of Adelphic Mobile, and other angel investors participating.

Versant Ventures has raised $305 million for its fifth venture fund, beating its initial $250 million target. The pool will focus on healthcare firms in all stages of development.
PRESS RELEASE
SAN FRANCISCO – December 10, 2014 – Versant Ventures, a global healthcare investment firm, today announced the close of Versant Venture Capital V L.P. at $305 million and in excess of the initial fund target of $250 million. Since its inception, Versant has raised $1.9 billion to invest in innovative biopharmaceutical, medical device, and healthcare services/HCIT companies. The firm invests from offices in North America and Europe, and it has assembled a team with deep investment, operating, and scientific expertise that enables a hands-on approach to company building.
The Versant V portfolio will be diversified with investments made across the healthcare sector and at all stages of company development. Consistent with recent strategy, a primary focus will be the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. Many of these companies will be launched by Versant and will enter into “build-to-buy” structured acquisitions with strategic partners at the outset. Key to that strategy are the firm’s company creation engines, Inception Sciences and Blueline Bioscience, which in recent years have collectively spawned seven companies and executed almost as many strategic partnerships. The remainder of the fund will be devoted to high potential companies in other healthcare sectors that are in need of growth capital to develop or commercialize their products. Investments out of Versant V began earlier this year and a number of commitments have already been made, including to Northern Biologics, a company launched by Blueline Bioscience that will develop novel therapeutic antibodies in a strategic partnership with Celgene.
“We are grateful for the support of our limited partners, who allow us to pursue our mission of helping exceptional entrepreneurs build the next generation of great healthcare companies,” said Brad Bolzon, Managing Director. “It’s an exciting time to be launching Versant V, and we look forward to working with talented teams, co-investors, and industry partners to advance important therapies and technologies that have the potential to substantially impact the industry.”
About Versant Ventures
Versant Ventures is a leading healthcare investment firm committed to helping exceptional entrepreneurs build the next generation of great healthcare companies. The firm invests across the healthcare sector and at all stages of company development, with an emphasis on the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. With $1.9 billion under management and offices in North America and Europe, Versant has built a team with deep investment, operating, and scientific expertise that enables a hands-on approach to company building. Since the firm’s founding in 1999, nearly 40 Versant companies have achieved successful acquisitions or IPOs. For more information, please visit www.versantventures.com.

Venture capital firm to catalyze healthcare investment activities across the country with significant support from leading Canadian investors
VANCOUVER, Dec. 10, 2014 /CNW/ - Versant Ventures, a global healthcare investment firm, today announced the close of Versant Venture Capital V L.P., at $305 million US, exceeding its target size of $250 million and including significant support from Business Development Bank of Canada, Fonds de solidarité FTQ, Northleaf Venture Catalyst Fund and Teralys Capital.
"We are grateful for the support of all our limited partners, who allow us to pursue the mission of helping exceptional entrepreneurs build the next generation of healthcare companies," said Brad Bolzon, Versant's Managing Director. "We are encouraged to see such strong support from Canadian investors who understand the value of supporting medical innovation occurring in institutions across the country."

Consistent with Versant's recent strategy, a key focus will be the discovery and development of novel therapeutics.

Many of these investments will be driven by Versant's own company creation engines which have collectively spawned seven new companies and consummated almost as many strategic pharmaceutical partnerships.

"We entered Canada with the idea that we could identify untapped healthcare investment opportunities," says Versant Partner Jerel Davis who oversees Canadian investment activities. Over the last 18 months, Versant has launched multiple enterprises throughout Canada including Inception Sciences research sites in Vancouver and Montreal and formed Blueline Bioscience, a biotechnology incubator in Toronto. Versant will take a pan-Canadian outlook to identify breakthroughs from world class research centers, capitalize on available life sciences talent and deploy its unique investment model. "Our vision is already becoming a reality based on the companies we have seen launch in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto. We believe that this approach to incubating and supporting early stage companies fits the Canadian environment extremely well," noted Davis. Since its inception, Versant has raised $1.9 billion US to invest in innovative biopharmaceutical, medical device, and healthcare services/HCIT companies.
