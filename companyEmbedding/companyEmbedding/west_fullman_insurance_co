My office serves the Silicon Valley Area, from Fremont to San Mateo, and Monterey through the South Bay. We can help insure your home and auto as well as your motorcycle, boat, and RV.
The San Jose agents are here to help.
We understand the great diversity of the San Francisco Bay Area and the South Bay. At the San Jose local GEICO office, we have agents who speak Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Hindi.

About Brent Fulk, your San Jose insurance agent.
Hi, my name is Brent Fulk. I have been an insurance agent with GEICO since 2003 and your local San Jose insurance agent since 2007. My office serves the Silicon Valley Area, from Fremont to San Mateo, and Monterey through the South Bay. We can help insure your home and auto as well as your motorcycle, boat, and RV.
The San Jose agents are here to help.
We understand the great diversity of the San Francisco Bay Area and the South Bay. At the San Jose local GEICO office, we have agents who speak Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Hindi. When you get a quote through our office, we'll make sure all your eligible discounts are applied. We make doing business with GEICO easy for you.
Spot Brent and his team in the community.
I'm a member of the Campbell Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Silicon Valley, and the Silicon Valley Capital Club. I also coach in the Almaden Little League.
Look for our San Jose insurance agents at local events such as the San Jose Sharks Street Rally or at San Jose State University football games. My office is also a drop-off site during the holidays for the Harvest Food Bank and for the USMC Toys for Tots. Stop by and say "hello!"
Find Your Way To The San Jose Location
We are just 2 miles south of downtown San Jose in the Plant Shopping Center. From Highway 87, take the Curtner Avenue exit heading north and we'll be on the left.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in New Mexico:













Does Fullman Company carry a valid contracting license?



Any residential or commercial construction work in the state of New Mexico requires a licensed contractor. This includes general construction work, electrical, mechanical and plumbing and LP gas. New Mexico issues contractor licenses in approxamitly 100 seperate categories.
Fullman Company currently holds license 51003 (Mechanical), which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in New Mexico?



Licensed contractors are required to either pass a business & law exam or complete a business & law course. In addition, depending on the trade, 2-4 years of work experience is required to obtain a license.











Your liability risk when hiring Fullman Company



Licensed contractors in New Mexico are required to carry an active workers' compensation insurance policy. State law does require contractors to carry general liability insurance, but hiring contractors who do have an active policy is highly recommended. Request a copy of each insurance certificate before any work begins.











Financial recourse when hiring Fullman Company



Licensed contractors in New Mexico must obtain a surety bond to before performing any residential work. Homeowners can file a claim against this bond in the event of faulty workmanship, breach of contract, or damages to their property during the contracted construction.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in New Mexico, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
