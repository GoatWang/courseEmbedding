Product Description
Charles C.Zhang – Make YourSelf a Millionaire

 
From the Back Cover
A Step-by-Step Plan that Will Meet All of Your Family’s Financial Needs–Both Today and Down the Road
Make Yourself a Millionaire is unlike any personal finance book you’ve ever read. Instead of enticing you with can’t-miss tricks for doubling your money overnight, tricks that usually only cost you money, it provides you with commonsense guidance for taking charge of every crucial financial aspect of your life–from saving and investing to life insurance, college tuition, taxes, and more.
Charles Zhang, one of today’s most honored and successful financial advisors, reveals keys to improving your money smarts across the board, keys that include:

Investing strategies for shrewdly building solid and long-lasting wealth in the stock market, with surprisingly little effort
In-depth descriptions of every major type of life insurance, with the pros and cons of each
Methods for getting the most from Social Security, whether you plan on retiring tomorrow or in 30 years

Praise for Make Yourself a Millionaire:
“Charles Zhang is a true American success story. His hard work and dedication to providing highquality financial advice is legendary within American Express. This book is a great roadmap for those who want to reach their dreams. It is a must read.”–Ken Chenault, Chairman and CEO, American Express
Deep down, millions of Americans suspect they should have a sensible, comprehensive financial plan. Yet even as barriers to achieving financial security increase by the day, such a plan–one that covers everything from investing to insurance to education costs to retirement–continues to remain far more the exception than the rule.
Make Yourself a Millionaire is today’s most straightforward guidebook for ensuring that all of your family’s financial needs are met. Award-winning financial advisor Charles Zhang–who became one of today’s most successful financial advisors by stressing sane and sensible investing strategies over dubious, get-rich-quick tricks and schemes–draws on his years of experience to outline a clear and rational program guaranteed to organize and plan every aspect of your financial life.
How can you gain the huge benefits of stock market investing while minimizing the risks? What type of life insurance should you have–and how much is too much? Zhang answers these questions and more as he discusses:

Guidelines for choosing a financial advisor that is right for you–and your situation
Facts you need to know about stocks, mutual funds, bonds, annuities, REITs, and more
Asset allocation strategies for cushioning against sudden market downturns
When good investing goes bad–actual case studies of investors trying shortcuts to beat the market, and losing
All about college savings plans, and how the popular 529 plan can afford you completely tax-free asset growth
Estate planning techniques designed to save your heirs thousands of dollars in estate taxes

Everyone who has a stake in the financial markets–and, today, that pretty much means everyone–should have a fundamental grasp of what they are investing in and why. Using real-life examples, plain-English explanations, helpful worksheets, and more, Make Yourself a Millionaire provides you with a wall-to-wall understanding of what you currently own versus what you need to own, and how to make them one and the same. Combining their textbook knowledge of financial planning with the unflinching honesty and empathy that have made them two of today’s most sought-after financial planners, Charles Zhang joins with wife and fellow planning professional Lynn L. Chen-Zhang to give you the knowledge you need to live a rewarding life today, while assuring yourself a long and financially comfortable retirement.

Fee-Only & Fiduciary

The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is the country's leading association of fee-only and fiduciary financial planners.










What is Fee-Only Financial Planning and Why Does it Matter when Choosing an Advisor?
Every financial advisor gets paid for doing their job, however they don't all get paid the same way. A fee-only financial planner (all NAPFA advisors are fee-only) is paid directly by the client on a transparent and pre-arranged payment plan.  This can be an hourly or project rate, monthly retainer, or percentage of the investments managed.
Other financial advisors are paid through other sources including by the companies they recommend. For example, if the planner sells you a specific investment, mutual fund, insurance or other products, they receive a commission or partial commission directly from the company.
When working with a NAPFA Registered Financial Advisor, there are no hidden fees, commissions, third-party payments, or product sales.
If you are not sure how your financial advisor gets paid, just ask them. It is not something that is easy to tell.
How a planner is paid is quite important because it can affect the advice that they offer to their clients. Professional financial planners need to make a living like everyone else, and they are likely to be most loyal to the person who pays them. If that person is you, the client, then pleasing you will bring them long-term business. They will consistently offer you the best financial advice that they have. A commission-based financial planner may be focusing on the companies they work for before the client's best interest. That situation may not be beneficial for all of their clients.
Ultimately, you want to pick a planner who will be loyal to you and your interests. That planner is the fee-only planner.

Fee-Only & Fiduciary

The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is the country's leading association of fee-only and fiduciary financial planners.










What is Fee-Only Financial Planning and Why Does it Matter when Choosing an Advisor?
Every financial advisor gets paid for doing their job, however they don't all get paid the same way. A fee-only financial planner (all NAPFA advisors are fee-only) is paid directly by the client on a transparent and pre-arranged payment plan.  This can be an hourly or project rate, monthly retainer, or percentage of the investments managed.
Other financial advisors are paid through other sources including by the companies they recommend. For example, if the planner sells you a specific investment, mutual fund, insurance or other products, they receive a commission or partial commission directly from the company.
When working with a NAPFA Registered Financial Advisor, there are no hidden fees, commissions, third-party payments, or product sales.
If you are not sure how your financial advisor gets paid, just ask them. It is not something that is easy to tell.
How a planner is paid is quite important because it can affect the advice that they offer to their clients. Professional financial planners need to make a living like everyone else, and they are likely to be most loyal to the person who pays them. If that person is you, the client, then pleasing you will bring them long-term business. They will consistently offer you the best financial advice that they have. A commission-based financial planner may be focusing on the companies they work for before the client's best interest. That situation may not be beneficial for all of their clients.
Ultimately, you want to pick a planner who will be loyal to you and your interests. That planner is the fee-only planner.
