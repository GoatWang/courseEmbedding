How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Compared to Amazon, Even Netflix Looks Like a Bargain
              
              Amazon.com Inc. has always been the ultimate long-term play for shareholders, given that the company has prioritized expansion at the expense of immediate profit. But even by those standards, it's a pricey bet.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL, INTEREST INCOME TO THE TRUSTS AND TO                 
UNIT HOLDERS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, IS EXEMPT UNDER EXISTING                 
LAW FROM ALL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. IN ADDITION, THE INTEREST INCOME             
TO THE TRUSTS IS, IN THE OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL, EXEMPT TO                  
THE EXTENT INDICATED FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES WHEN HELD BY RESIDENTS          
OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE ISSUERS OF THE BONDS IN SUCH TRUST ARE                
LOCATED. CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ARE SUBJECT TO TAX.                             

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES 211 consists of the underlying                  
separate unit investment trusts set forth above. The various trusts             
are collectively referred to herein as the "Trusts" while all                   
Trusts that are not designated as "The First Trust Advantage"                   
are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Insured                   
Trusts" and a Trust with the name designation of "The First Trust               
of Insured Municipal Bonds, Discount Trust" or "The First Trust                 
Advantage: Discount Trust" is sometimes referred to herein as                   
a "Discount Trust." Each Trust consists of a portfolio of interest-bearing      
obligations (including delivery statements relating to contracts                
for the purchase of certain such obligations and an irrevocable                 
letter of credit), issued by or on behalf of states and territories             
of the United States, and political subdivisions and authorities                
thereof, the interest on which is, in the opinion of recognized                 
bond counsel to the issuing governmental authorities, exempt from               
all Federal income taxes under existing law, although interest                  
on certain Bonds in the Kansas Insured Trust will be a preference               
item for purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax. In addition,                  
the interest income of each Trust is, in the opinion of Special                 
Counsel, exempt to the extent indicated from state and local income             
taxes when held by residents of the state in which the issuers                  
of the Bonds in such Trust are located. The Sponsor has a limited               
right to substitute other bonds in each Trust portfolio in the                  
event of a failed contract. The securities in a Discount Trust                  
are acquired at prices which result in a Discount Trust portfolio,              
as a whole, being purchased at a deep discount from the aggregate               
par value of such Securities.                                                   

INSURANCE GUARANTEEING THE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND                  
INTEREST ON ALL BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO OF EACH INSURED TRUST HAS                
BEEN OBTAINED FROM FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY AND/OR                  
AMBAC INDEMNITY CORPORATION BY THE INSURED TRUSTS OR WAS DIRECTLY               
OBTAINED BY THE BOND ISSUER, THE UNDERWRITERS, THE SPONSOR OR                   
OTHERS PRIOR TO THE DATE OF DEPOSIT FROM FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE           
COMPANY, AMBAC INDEMNITY CORPORATION, OR OTHER INSURERS (THE "PREINSURED        
BONDS"). INSURANCE OBTAINED BY AN INSURED TRUST APPLIES ONLY WHILE              
BONDS ARE RETAINED IN SUCH TRUST, WHILE INSURANCE ON PREINSURED                 
BONDS IS EFFECTIVE SO LONG AS SUCH BONDS ARE OUTSTANDING. PURSUANT              
TO AN IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT OF FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY,           
AND/OR AMBAC INDEMNITY CORPORATION IN THE EVENT OF A SALE OF A                  
BOND INSURED UNDER AN INSURANCE POLICY OBTAINED BY AN INSURED                   
TRUST, THE TRUSTEE HAS THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN PERMANENT INSURANCE                  
FOR SUCH BOND UPON THE PAYMENT OF A SINGLE PREDETERMINED INSURANCE              
PREMIUM FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF SUCH BOND. THE INSURANCE,              
IN EITHER CASE, RELATES ONLY TO THE BONDS IN THE INSURED TRUSTS                 
AND NOT TO THE UNITS OFFERED HEREBY. AS A RESULT OF SUCH INSURANCE,             
THE UNITS OF EACH INSURED TRUST HAVE RECEIVED A RATING OF "AAA" 
BY STANDARD & POOR'S CORPORATION. SEE "WHY AND HOW ARE THE INSURED 
TRUSTS INSURED?" ON PAGE 13. NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO ANY                
INSURER'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS COMMITMENTS.                                      
THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE                   
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION           
NOR HAS THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY STATE SECURITIES          
COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS.             
ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.                       

The date of this Prospectus is February 17, 1994                

Page 1                                                                          

For convenience the Prospectus is divided into sections which                   
give general information about the Fund and specific information                
such as the public offering price, distributions and tax status                 
for each Trust.                                                                 

The Objectives of the Fund are conservation of capital through                  
investment in portfolios of tax-exempt bonds and income exempt                  
from Federal and applicable state and local income taxes although               
interest on certain Bonds in the Kansas Insured Trust will be                   
a preference item for purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax.                  
ACCORDINGLY, THE KANSAS INSURED TRUST MAY BE APPROPRIATE ONLY                   
FOR INVESTORS WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX                
The payment of interest and the preservation of principal are,                  
of course, dependent upon the continuing ability of the issuers,                
obligors and/or insurers to meet their respective obligations.                  

Distributions to Unit holders may be reinvested as described herein.            
See "How Can Distributions to Unit Holders be Reinvested?"                      

The Sponsor, although not obligated to do so, intends to maintain               
a market for the Units at prices based upon the aggregate bid                   
price of the Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust. In the absence               
of such a market, a Unit holder will nonetheless be able to dispose             
of the Units through redemption at prices based upon the bid prices             
of the underlying Bonds. See "How May Units be Redeemed?" With                  
respect to each Insured Trust, neither the bid nor offering prices              
of the underlying Bonds or of the Units, absent situations in                   
which Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest                  
or in significant risk of such default, include value attributable              
to the portfolio insurance obtained by such Trust. See "Why and
How are the Insured Trusts Insured?"

[FN]                                                                            

(1)     Many unit investment trusts comprised of municipal securities           
issue a number of Units such that each Unit represents approximately            
$1,000 principal amount of underlying securities. The Sponsor,                  
on the other hand, in determining the number of Units for each                  
Trust, other than Discount Trusts, has elected not to follow this               
format but rather to provide that number of Units which will establish          
as close as possible as of the opening of business on the Date                  
of Deposit a Public Offering Price per Unit of $1,000.                          

(2)     Sales charges for the Trusts, expressed as a percentage of              
the Public Offering Price per Unit and in parenthesis as a percentage           
of the Aggregate Offering Price Evaluation per Unit, are as follows:            
4.9% (5.152%) for a National Trust, California Trust and a Kansas               
Trust, 5.5% (5.820%) for other State Trusts and 3.9% (4.058%)                   
for an Intermediate Trust.                                                      

(3)     Anyone ordering Units for settlement after the First Settlement         
Date will pay accrued interest from such date to the date of settlement         
(normally five business days after order) less distributions from               
the Interest Account subsequent to the First Settlement Date.                   
For purchases settling on the First Settlement Date, no accrued                 
interest will be added to the Public Offering Price. After the                  
initial offering period, the Sponsor's Repurchase Price per Unit                
will be determined as described under the caption "Will There
Be a Secondary Market?"                                                         

(4)     See "How May Units be Redeemed?"                                        

(5)     A Trust may be terminated if the value thereof is less than             
20% of the original principal amount of Bonds deposited in a Trust.

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES               

What is the First Trust Combined Series?                                        

The First Trust Combined Series 211 is one of a series of investment            
companies created by the Sponsor under the name of The First Trust              
Combined Series, all of which are generally similar but each of                 
which is separate and is designated by a different series number.               
This Series consists of underlying separate unit investment trusts              
designated as: The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-Multi-State:          
California Trust, Series 8 and Kansas Trust, Series 26 (such Trusts             
being collectively referred to herein as the "Fund"). This Series               
was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to                 
a Trust Agreement (the "Indenture"), dated the Date of Deposit,                 
with Nike Securities L.P., as Sponsor, United States Trust Company              
of New York, as Trustee, Securities Evaluation Service, Inc.,                   
as Evaluator and First Trust Advisors L.P., as Portfolio Supervisor.            
On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee                  
interest-bearing obligations, including delivery statements relating            
to contracts for the purchase of certain such obligations and                   
an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a financial institution               
in the amount required for such purchases (the "Bonds"). The Trustee            
thereafter credited the account of the Sponsor for Units of each                
Trust representing the entire ownership of the Fund which Units                 
are being offered hereby.                                                       

The objectives of the Fund are Federal tax-exempt income and state              
and local tax-exempt income and conservation of capital through                 
investment in portfolios of interest-bearing obligations issued                 
by or on behalf of the state for which such Trust is named (collectively,       
the "State Trusts"), and counties, municipalities, authorities                  
and political subdivisions thereof, the Commonwealth of Puerto                  
Rico and other territories or municipalities of the United States,              
or authorities or political subdivisions thereof, the interest                  
on which obligations is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel              
to the issuing governmental authorities, exempt from all Federal                
income tax and, where applicable, state and local taxes under                   
existing law although interest on certain Bonds in the Kansas                   
Insured Trust will be a preference item for purposes of the Alternative         
Minimum Tax. The current market value of certain of the obligations             
in a Discount Trust are significantly below face value when the                 
obligations are acquired by such Trust. The prices at which the                 
obligations are acquired result in a Discount Trust's portfolio,                
as a whole, being purchased at a deep discount from the aggregate               
par value of such Securities. Insurance guaranteeing the scheduled              
payment of all principal and interest on Bonds in the Trusts with               
the name designation of "The First Trust of Insured Municipal                   
Bonds", "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-Intermediate"               
or "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-Multi-State" (the                
"Insured Trusts") has been obtained by such Trusts from Financial               
Guaranty Insurance Company ("Financial Guaranty") and/or AMBAC                  
Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity") or was obtained directly              
by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others prior               
to the Date of Deposit from Financial Guaranty, AMBAC Indemnity,                
or other insurers (the "Preinsured Bonds"). NO PORTFOLIO INSURANCE              
POLICY HAS BEEN OBTAINED BY THE TRUSTS WITH THE NAME DESIGNATION                
OF "THE FIRST TRUST ADVANTAGE" (THE "ADVANTAGE TRUSTS").  The                   
portfolio insurance obtained by the Insured Trusts is effective                 
only while the Bonds thus insured are held in such Trusts, while                
insurance on Preinsured Bonds is effective so long as such Bonds                
are outstanding. See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?"
THERE IS, OF COURSE, NO GUARANTEE THAT THE FUND'S OBJECTIVES WILL               
BE ACHIEVED. AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND SHOULD BE MADE WITH AN                   
UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS WHICH AN INVESTMENT IN FIXED RATE LONG-TERM          
DEBT OBLIGATIONS MAY ENTAIL, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT THE VALUE                  
OF THE UNITS WILL DECLINE WITH INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES.                     

Neither the Public Offering Price of the Units of an Insured Trust              
nor any evaluation of such Units for purposes of repurchases or                 
redemptions reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained            
by such Trust unless Bonds are in default in payment of principal               
or interest or in significant risk of such default. See "Public
Offering-How is the Public Offering Price Determined?" On the                   
other hand, the value of insurance obtained by the Bond issuer,                 
the underwriters, the Sponsor or others is reflected and included               
in the market value of such Bonds.                                              

Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust or by the Bond issuer,                   
the underwriters, the Sponsor or others is not a substitute for                 
the basic credit of an issuer, but supplements the existing credit              
and provides additional security                                                

Page 4                                                                          

therefor. If an issue is accepted for insurance, a noncancellable               
policy for the scheduled payment of interest and principal on                   
the Bonds is issued by the insurer. A single premium is paid by                 
the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others for Preinsured         
Bonds and a monthly premium is paid by each Insured Trust for                   
the insurance obtained by such Trust except for Bonds in such                   
Trust which are insured by the Bond issuer, the underwriters,                   
the Sponsor or others in which case no premiums for insurance                   
are paid by such Trust. Upon the sale of a Bond insured under                   
the insurance policy obtained by an Insured Trust, the Trustee                  
has the right to obtain permanent insurance from Financial Guaranty             
and/or AMBAC Indemnity with respect to such Bond upon the payment               
of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds                   
of the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in an Insured                   
Trust of the Fund is eligible to be sold on an insured basis.                   
Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.               
have rated the claims-paying ability of Financial Guaranty and                  
AMBAC Indemnity "AAA" and "Aaa," respectively. See "Why and How
are the Insured Trusts Insured?"                                                

In selecting Bonds, the following facts, among others, were considered:         
(i) the Standard & Poor's Corporation rating of the Bonds was                   
in no case less than "BBB" in the case of an Insured Trust and                  
"A-" in the case of an Advantage Trust, or the Moody's Investors                
Service, Inc. rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "Baa"                
in the case of an Insured Trust and "A" in the case of an Advantage             
Trust, including provisional or conditional ratings, respectively,              
or, if not rated, the Bonds had, in the opinion of the Sponsor,                 
credit characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics       
of interest-bearing tax-exempt obligations that were so rated                   
as to be acceptable for acquisition by the Fund (see "Description               
of Bond Ratings"); (ii) the prices of the Bonds relative to other               
bonds of comparable quality and maturity; (iii) with respect to                 
the Insured Trusts, the availability and cost of insurance of                   
the principal and interest on the Bonds and (iv) the diversification            
of Bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer. Subsequent              
to the Date of Deposit, a Bond may cease to be rated or its rating              
may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit.            
Neither event requires elimination of such Bond from the portfolio,             
but may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether              
or not to direct the Trustee to dispose of the Bond. See "Rights                
of Unit Holders-How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?"                        

Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may have been acquired at a                   
market discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest                 
rates on the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and                 
deposited in the Trust were lower than the current market interest              
rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type. If                  
such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase,                 
the market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater,             
and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline,           
the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced,                 
other things being equal. Investors should also note that the                   
value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in                  
value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest               
rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the value               
of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than               
bonds purchased at a market premium. In addition, if interest                   
rates rise, the prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium bonds               
and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds                   
will be reduced. A discount bond held to maturity will have a                   
larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income                
and capital gain and less in the form of tax-exempt interest income             
than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates. See                
"What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?" Market discount               
attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market             
confidence in the issue. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall              
be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any                  
of the Bonds.                                                                   

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be original issue discount               
bonds. Under current law, the original issue discount, which is                 
the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity                  
and the issue price of the Bonds, is deemed to accrue on a daily                
basis and the accrued portion is treated as tax-exempt interest                 
income for Federal income tax purposes. On sale or redemption,                  
any gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original           
issue discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain                  
is attributable to market discount in which case the accretion                  
of market discount is taxable as ordinary income. See "What is
the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?" The current value of                   
an original issue discount bond reflects the present value                      

Page 5                                                                          

of its stated redemption price at maturity. The market value tends              
to increase in greater increments as the Bonds approach maturity.               

Certain of the original issue discount bonds may be Zero Coupon                 
Bonds (including bonds known as multiplier bonds, money multiplier              
bonds, capital appreciation bonds, capital accumulator bonds,                   
compound interest bonds and money discount maturity payment bonds).             
Zero Coupon Bonds do not provide for the payment of any current                 
interest and generally provide for payment at maturity at face                  
value unless sooner sold or redeemed. Zero Coupon Bonds may be                  
subject to more price volatility than conventional bonds. While                 
some types of Zero Coupon Bonds, such as multipliers and capital                
appreciation bonds, define par as the initial offering price rather             
than the maturity value, they share the basic Zero Coupon Bond                  
features of (1) not paying interest on a semi-annual basis and                  
(2) providing for the reinvestment of the bond's semi-annual earnings           
at the bond's stated yield to maturity. While Zero Coupon Bonds                 
are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate of                   
return minimizes reinvestment risk, this benefit can be negated                 
in large part by weak call protection, i.e., a bond's provision                 
for redemption at only a modest premium over the accreted value                 
of the bond.                                                                    

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may have been acquired at a                  
market premium from par value at maturity. The coupon interest                  
rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased and                  
deposited in the Trusts were higher than the current market interest            
rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type. If                  
such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable                   
bonds decrease, the market premium of previously issued bonds                   
will be increased, and if such interest rates for newly issued                  
comparable bonds increase, the market premium of previously issued              
bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. The current returns            
of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than                  
the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued                
at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend               
to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the                  
face amount becomes payable. Because part of the purchase price                 
is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments,           
early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments                  
of principal will result in a reduction in yield. Redemption pursuant           
to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant to                   
sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed                   
Bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium                
over par or for original issue discount Bonds a premium over the                
accreted value. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in                  
the Fund at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed,           
this will represent a loss of capital when compared to the original             
Public Offering Price of the Units. Because premium bonds generally             
pay a higher rate of interest than bonds priced at or below par,                
the effect of the redemption of premium bonds would be to reduce                
Estimated Net Annual Unit Income by a greater percentage than                   
the par amount of such bonds bears to the total par amount of                   
Bonds in the Trust. Although the actual impact of any such redemptions          
that may occur will depend upon the specific Bonds that are redeemed,           
it can be anticipated that the Estimated Net Annual Unit Income                 
will be significantly reduced after the dates on which such Bonds               
are eligible for redemption. The Trust may be required to sell                  
Zero Coupon Bonds prior to maturity (at their current market price              
which is likely to be less than their par value) in the event                   
that all the Bonds in the portfolio other than the Zero Coupon                  
Bonds are called or redeemed in order to pay expenses of the Trust              
or in case the Trust is terminated. See "Rights of Unit Holders:                
How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?" and "Other Information:                
How May the Indenture be Amended or Terminated?" See "Portfolio"                
for each Trust for the earliest scheduled call date and the initial             
redemption price for each Bond.                                                 

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be general obligations                   
of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of                 
such entity. All other Bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds payable            
from the income of a specific project or authority and are not                  
supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes. General obligation               
bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge of its faith, credit                   
and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest. Revenue             
bonds, on the other hand, are payable only from the revenues derived            
from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in some                   
cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific              
revenue source. There are, of course, variations in the security                
of the different Bonds in the Fund, both within a particular classification     
and between classifications, depending on numerous factors.                     

Page 6                                                                          

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be health care revenue                   
bonds. Ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are                   
sometimes based on feasibility studies that contain projections                 
of occupancy levels, revenues and expenses. A facility's gross                  
receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected              
by future events and conditions including among other things,                   
demand for services, the ability of the facility to provide the                 
services required, physicians' confidence in the facility, management           
capabilities, competition with other hospitals, efforts by insurers             
and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing              
state rate-setting agencies, expenses, government regulation,                   
the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance                   
and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance,        
including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar             
third party payor programs. Pursuant to recent Federal legislation,             
Medicare reimbursements are currently calculated on a prospective               
basis utilizing a single nationwide schedule of rates. Prior to                 
such legislation Medicare reimbursements were based on the actual               
costs incurred by the health facility. The current legislation                  
may adversely affect reimbursements to hospitals and other facilities           
for services provided under the Medicare program.                               

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be single family mortgage                
revenue bonds, which are issued for the purpose of acquiring from               
originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages                   
on residences located within the issuer's boundaries and owned                  
by persons of low or moderate income. Mortgage loans are generally              
partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities                 
as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises,                   
default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because these Bonds are                 
subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part               
from such prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion                  
of such Bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled                
maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates. The redemption           
price of such issues may be more or less than the offering price                
of such Bonds. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium               
could also result from the failure of the originating financial                 
institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within                
a specified time period or, in some cases, from the sale by the                 
Bond issuer of the mortgage loans. Failure of the originating                   
financial institutions to make mortgage loans would be due principally          
to the interest rates on mortgage loans funded from other sources               
becoming competitive with the interest rates on the mortgage loans              
funded with the proceeds of the single family mortgage revenue                  
bonds. Additionally, unusually high rates of default on the underlying          
mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of                 
principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds. Single                 
family mortgage revenue bonds issued after December 31, 1980 were               
issued under Section 103A of the Internal Revenue Code, which                   
Section contains certain ongoing requirements relating to the                   
use of the proceeds of such Bonds in order for the interest on                  
such Bonds to retain its tax-exempt status. In each case, the                   
issuer of the Bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable ongoing            
requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion              
that the interest on the Bonds is exempt from Federal income tax                
under existing laws and regulations. There can be no assurances                 
that the ongoing requirements will be met. The failure to meet                  
these requirements could cause the interest on the Bonds to become              
taxable, possibly retroactively from the date of issuance.                      

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers                
whose revenues are primarily derived from mortgage loans to housing             
projects for low to moderate income families. The ability of such               
issuers to make debt service payments will be affected by events                
and conditions affecting financed projects, including, among other              
things, the achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy                 
levels and adequate rental income, increases in taxes, employment               
and income conditions prevailing in local labor markets, utility                
costs and other operating expenses, the managerial ability of                   
project managers, changes in laws and governmental regulations,                 
the appropriation of subsidies and social and economic trends                   
affecting the localities in which the projects are located. The                 
occupancy of housing projects may be adversely affected by high                 
rent levels and income limitations imposed under Federal and state              
programs. Like single family mortgage revenue bonds, multi-family               
mortgage revenue bonds are subject to redemption and call features,             
including extraordinary mandatory redemption features, upon prepayment,         
sale or non-origination of mortgage loans as well as upon the                   
occurrence of other events. Certain issuers of single or multi-family           
housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they                 
have issued prior to the stated first redemption                                

Page 7                                                                          

dates for such bonds. In one situation the New York City Housing                
Development Corporation, in reliance on its interpretation of                   
certain language in the indenture under which one of its bond                   
issues was created, redeemed all of such issue at par in spite                  
of the fact that such indenture provided that the first optional                
redemption was to include a premium over par and could not occur                
prior to 1992. In connection with the housing Bonds held by a                   
Trust, the Sponsor has not had any direct communications with                   
any of the issuers thereof, but at the Date of Deposit it is not                
aware that any of the respective issuers of such Bonds are actively             
considering the redemption of such Bonds prior to their respective              
stated initial call dates. However, there can be no assurance                   
that an issuer of a Bond in a Trust will not attempt to so redeem               
a Bond in a Trust.                                                              

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers                
whose revenues are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage               
services. Water and sewerage bonds are generally payable from                   
user fees. Problems faced by such issuers include the ability                   
to obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline                
resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing                   
large construction programs, the limitations on operations and                  
increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations,        
the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies              
of fresh water, the effect of conservation programs and the impact              
of "no-growth" zoning ordinances. All of such issuers have been                 
experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees.                      

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers                
whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of electric                  
energy. Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation                 
by state utility commissions which, among other things, establish               
the rates which may be charged and the appropriate rate of return               
on an approved asset base. The problems faced by such issuers                   
include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate            
rate increases from the governing public utility commission, the                
difficulty in financing large construction programs, the limitations            
on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental      
considerations, increased competition, recent reductions in estimates           
of future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country,               
the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt,                 
the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the                   
effect of energy conservation. All of such issuers have been experiencing       
certain of these problems in varying degrees. In addition, Federal,             
state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to                   
time review existing and impose additional regulations governing                
the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants,              
which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of such                   
Bonds to make payments of principal and/or interest on such Bonds.              

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be lease obligations issued              
for the most part by governmental authorities that have no taxing               
power or other means of directly raising revenues. Rather, the                  
governmental authorities are financing vehicles created solely                  
for the construction of buildings (schools, administrative offices,             
convention centers and prisons, for example) or the purchase of                 
equipment (police cars and computer systems, for example) that                  
will be used by a state or local government (the "lessee"). Thus,               
these obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of                 
the lessee government to meet its lease rental payments which                   
include debt service on the obligations. Lease obligations are                  
subject, in almost all cases, to the annual appropriation risk,                 
i.e., the lessee government is not legally obligated to budget                  
and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the current fiscal               
year. These obligations are also subject to construction and abatement          
risk in many states - rental obligations cease in the event that                
delays in building, damage, destruction or condemnation of the                  
project prevents its use by the lessee. In these cases, insurance               
provisions designed to alleviate this risk become important credit              
factors. In the event of default by the lessee government, there                
may be significant legal and/or practical difficulties involved                 
in the re-letting or sale of the project. Some of these issues,                 
particularly those for equipment purchase, contain the so-called                
"substitution safeguard", which bars the lessee government, in                  
the event it defaults on its rental payments, from the purchase                 
or use of similar equipment for a certain period of time. This                  
safeguard is designed to insure that the lessee government will                 
appropriate, even though it is not legally obligated to do so,                  
but its legality remains untested in most, if not all, states.                  

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be industrial revenue bonds              
("IRBs"), including pollution control revenue bonds, which are                  
tax-exempt securities issued by states, municipalities, public                  
authorities or similar                                                          

Page 8                                                                          

entities to finance the cost of acquiring, constructing or improving            
various industrial projects. These projects are usually operated                
by corporate entities. Issuers are obligated only to pay amounts                
due on the IRBs to the extent that funds are available from the                 
unexpended proceeds of the IRBs or receipts or revenues of the                  
issuer under an arrangement between the issuer and the corporate                
operator of a project. The arrangement may be in the form of a                  
lease, installment sale agreement, conditional sale agreement                   
or loan agreement, but in each case the payments to the issuer                  
are designed to be sufficient to meet the payments of amounts                   
due on the IRBs. Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs                   
is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate                  
operator of the project or corporate guarantor. Corporate operators             
or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an                 
adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company                  
or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and earnings,                
regulatory and environmental restrictions, litigation resulting                 
from accidents or environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive                   
competition and financial deterioration resulting from a complete               
restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buy-out, takeover or otherwise.           
Such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming           
highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's creditworthiness,          
which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or                 
market value of such Bonds. Further, the possibility of such a                  
restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and                  
consequently the value of such Bonds, even though no actual takeover            
or other action is ever contemplated or affected. The IRBs in                   
a Trust may be subject to special or extraordinary redemption                   
provisions which may provide for redemption at par or, with respect             
to original issue discount bonds, at issue price plus the amount                
of original issue discount accreted to the redemption date plus,                
if applicable, a premium. The Sponsor cannot predict the causes                 
or likelihood of the redemption of IRBs or other Bonds in the                   
Trusts prior to the stated maturity of such Bonds.                              

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations which are                 
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership                 
and operation of facilities such as airports, bridges, turnpikes,               
port authorities, convention centers and arenas. The major portion              
of an airport's gross operating income is generally derived from                
fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements                
which consist of annual payments for leases, occupancy of certain               
terminal space and service fees. Airport operating income may                   
therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their              
obligations under the use agreements. The air transport industry                
is experiencing significant variations in earnings and traffic,                 
due to increased competition, excess capacity, increased costs,                 
deregulation, traffic constraints and other factors, and several                
airlines are experiencing severe financial difficulties. The Sponsor            
cannot predict what effect these industry conditions may have                   
on airport revenues which are dependent for payment on the financial            
condition of the airlines and their usage of the particular airport             
facility. Similarly, payment on Bonds related to other facilities               
is dependent on revenues from the projects, such as user fees                   
from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings.            
Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues           
due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance, decreased                 
use of a facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation,           
scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents.                                

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers                
which are, or which govern the operation of, schools, colleges                  
and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad                  
valorem taxes, or for higher education systems, from tuition,                   
dormitory revenues, grants and endowments. General problems relating            
to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality       
of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes, thereby            
creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools                  
in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas. Litigation or legislation           
on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the                 
payment of school bonds in the Trusts. General problems relating                
to college and university obligations would include the prospect                
of a declining percentage of the population consisting of "college"             
age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees                  
sufficiently to cover increased operating costs, the uncertainty                
of continued receipt of Federal grants and state funding and new                
government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect                
the revenues or costs of such issuers. All of such issuers have                 
been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees.                 

Page 9                                                                          

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations which are                 
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation                 
of resource recovery facilities. Resource recovery facilities                   
are designed to process solid waste, generate steam and convert                 
steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds may be subject to                 
extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of                 
certain circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction                
or condemnation of a project; contracts relating to a project                   
becoming void, unenforceable or impossible to perform; changes                  
in the economic availability of raw materials, operating supplies               
or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological         
or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation                  
of a project; administrative or judicial actions which render                   
contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or impossible            
to perform; or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities.            
The Sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption           
of resource recovery bonds in the Trusts prior to the stated maturity           
of the Bonds.                                                                   

Investors should be aware that many of the Bonds in the Trusts                  
are subject to continuing requirements such as the actual use                   
of Bond proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed                 
from Bond proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on                 
such Bonds from Federal income taxation. Although at the time                   
of issuance of each of the Bonds in the Trusts an opinion of bond               
counsel was rendered as to the exemption of interest on such obligations        
from Federal income taxation, there can be no assurance that the                
respective issuers or other obligors on such obligations will                   
fulfill the various continuing requirements established upon issuance           
of the Bonds. A failure to comply with such requirements may cause              
a determination that interest on such obligations is subject to                 
Federal income taxation, perhaps even retroactively from the date               
of issuance of such Bonds, thereby reducing the value of the Bonds              
and subjecting Unit holders to unanticipated tax liabilities.                   

Because certain of the Bonds may from time to time under certain                
circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance                  
with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will                 
be distributed to Unit holders and will not be reinvested, no                   
assurance can be given that a Trust will retain for any length                  
of time its present size and composition. Neither the Sponsor                   
nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure             
or defect in any Bond. Certain of the Bonds contained in the Trusts             
may be subject to being called or redeemed in whole or in part                  
prior to their stated maturities pursuant to optional redemption                
provisions, sinking fund provisions, special or extraordinary                   
redemption provisions or otherwise. See "Portfolio" for each Trust.             
A bond subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption           
or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A                   
refunding is a method by which a bond issue is redeemed, at or                  
before maturity, by the proceeds of a new bond issue. A bond subject            
to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial                   
call from time to time at par or, in the case of a zero coupon                  
bond, at the accreted value from a fund accumulated for the scheduled           
retirement of a portion of an issue prior to maturity. Special                  
or extraordinary redemption provisions may provide for redemption               
at par (or for original issue discount bonds at issue price plus                
the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date               
plus, if applicable, some premium) of all or a portion of an issue              
upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Generally, events                 
that may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of Bonds                  
or may require mandatory redemption of Bonds include, among others:             
a final determination that the interest on the Bonds is taxable;                
the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty                 
of the project for which the proceeds of the Bonds were used;                   
an exercise by a local, state or Federal governmental unit of                   
its power of eminent domain to take all or substantially all of                 
the project for which the proceeds of the Bonds were used; changes              
in the economic availability of raw materials, operating supplies               
or facilities or technological or other changes which render the                
operation of the project, for which the proceeds of the Bonds                   
were used, uneconomic; changes in law or an administrative or                   
judicial decree which renders the performance of the agreement                  
under which the proceeds of the Bonds were made available to finance            
the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or                 
which imposes excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not imposed                 
on the date the Bonds are issued on the issuer of the Bonds or                  
the user of the proceeds of the Bonds; an administrative or judicial            
decree which requires the cessation of a substantial part of the                
operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the Bonds;              
an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with                 
the proceeds of the Bonds resulting in excess                                   

Page 10                                                                         

proceeds of the Bonds which may be applied to redeem Bonds; or                  
an underestimate of a source of funds securing the Bonds resulting              
in excess funds which may be applied to redeem Bonds. See also                  
the discussion of single family mortgage and multi-family mortgage              
revenue bonds above for more information on the call provisions                 
of such bonds. The exercise of redemption or call provisions will               
(except to the extent the proceeds of the called Bonds are used                 
to pay for Unit redemptions) result in the distribution of principal            
and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest              
distributions; it may also affect the long-term return and the                  
current return on Units of each Trust. Redemption pursuant to                   
call provisions is more likely to occur, and redemption pursuant                
to sinking fund provisions may occur, when the Bonds have an offering           
side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original              
issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value. Unit holders            
may recognize capital gain or loss upon any redemption or call.                 

The contracts to purchase Bonds delivered to the Trustee represent              
an obligation by issuers or dealers to deliver Bonds to the Sponsor             
for deposit in each Trust. Contracts are typically settled and                  
the Bonds delivered within a few business days subsequent to the                
Date of Deposit. The percentage of the aggregate principal amount               
of the Bonds of each Trust relating to "when, as and if issued"                 
Bonds or other Bonds with delivery dates after the date of settlement           
for a purchase made on the Date of Deposit, if any, is indicated                
in the section for each Trust entitled "Portfolio." Interest on                 
"when, as and if issued" and delayed delivery Bonds begins accruing             
to the benefit of Unit holders on their dates of delivery. Because              
"when, as and if issued" Bonds have not yet been issued, as of                  
the Date of Deposit each Trust is subject to the risk that the                  
issuers thereof might decide not to proceed with the offering                   
of such Bonds or that the delivery of such Bonds or the delayed                 
delivery Bonds may be delayed. If such Bonds, or replacement bonds              
described below, are not acquired by a Trust or if their delivery               
is delayed, the Estimated Long-Term Return and the Estimated Current            
Return (if applicable) shown in the "Special Trust Information"                 
for that Trust may be reduced.                                                  

In the event of a failure to deliver any Bond that has been purchased           
for a Trust under a contract, including those Bonds purchased                   
on a "when, as and if issued" basis ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor               
is authorized under the Indenture to direct the Trustee to acquire              
other specified bonds ("New Bonds") to make up the original corpus              
of such Trust. The New Bonds must be purchased within twenty days               
after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and the purchase            
price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount                 
of funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The New                 
Bonds (i) must satisfy the criteria previously described for Bonds              
originally included in the Trust, (ii) must have a fixed maturity               
date of at least ten years or, in the case of a shorter term Trust,             
within the range of maturities of the Bonds initially deposited                 
in such Trust, but not exceeding the maturity date of the Failed                
Bonds, (iii) must be purchased at a price that results in a yield               
to maturity and in a current return, in each case as of the Date                
of Deposit, at least equal to that of the Failed Bonds, (iv) shall              
not be "when, as and if issued" bonds, (v) with respect to an                   
Insured Trust, when acquired by such Insured Trust must be insured              
by Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity under the insurance                
policy obtained by such Insured Trust or must be insured under                  
an insurance policy obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters,              
the Sponsor or others and (vi) shall have the benefit of exemption              
from state taxation on interest to an equal or greater extent                   
than the Failed Bonds they replace. Whenever a New Bond has been                
acquired for a Trust, the Trustee shall, within five days thereafter,           
notify all Unit holders of such Trust of the acquisition of the                 
New Bond and shall, on the next monthly distribution date which                 
is more than 30 days thereafter, make a pro rata distribution                   
of the amount, if any, by which the cost to such Trust of the                   
Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the New Bond plus accrued interest.            
Once the original corpus of a Trust is acquired, the Trustee will               
have no power to vary the investment of such Trust, i.e., the                   
Trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market               
variations to improve a Unit holder's investment.                               

If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding                 
paragraph shall not be utilized to acquire New Bonds in the event               
of a failed contract, the Sponsor shall refund the sales charge                 
and the Purchased Interest attributable to such failed contract                 
to all Unit holders of the affected Trust, and the principal and                
accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the relevant Bond to the                
date the Sponsor is notified of the failure) attributable                       

Page 11                                                                         

to such failed contract shall be distributed not more than thirty               
days after the determination of such failure or at such earlier                 
time as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems to be in the                   
interest of the Unit holders of the affected Trust. Unit holders                
should be aware that at the time of the receipt of such refunded                
principal they may not be able to reinvest such principal in other              
securities at a yield equal to or in excess of the yield which                  
such principal would have earned to Unit holders had the Failed                 
Bond been delivered to the Trust. The portion of such interest                  
paid to a Unit holder which accrued after the expected date of                  
settlement for purchase of his Units will be paid by the Sponsor                
and accordingly will not be treated as tax-exempt income.                       

To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending            
as of the Date of Deposit in respect of any Bonds which might                   
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon                   
the Trusts. At any time after the Date of Deposit, litigation                   
may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to Bonds                  
in a Trust. Such litigation, as for example suits challenging                   
the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental             
protection statutes, may affect the validity of such Bonds or                   
the tax-free nature of the interest thereon. While the outcome                  
of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted,                   
the Fund has received opinions of bond counsel to the issuing                   
authority of each Bond on the date of issuance to the effect that               
such Bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon               
is exempt from Federal income taxes and state and local taxes.                  
In addition, other factors may arise from time to time which potentially        
may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken                
with respect to the Bonds.                                                      

Each Unit initially offered represents that fractional undivided                
interest in such Trust as is set forth in the "Summary of Essential
Information" for each Trust. To the extent that any Units of a                  
Trust are redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest            
in such Trust represented by each unredeemed Unit will increase,                
although the actual interest in such Trust represented by such                  
fraction will remain substantially unchanged. Units will remain                 
outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the Trustee by any Unit               
holder, which may include the Sponsor, or until the termination                 
of the Trust Agreement.                                                         

What are Estimated Long-Term Return and Estimated Current Return?               

At the opening of business on the Date of Deposit, the Estimated                
Current Return (if applicable) and the Estimated Long-Term Return               
are as set forth in "Special Trust Information" for each Trust.                 
Estimated Current Return is computed by dividing the Estimated                  
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public Offering Price.               
Any change in either the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income                   
per Unit or the Public Offering Price will result in a change                   
in the Estimated Current Return. For each Trust, the Public Offering            
Price will vary in accordance with fluctuations in the prices                   
of the underlying Bonds and the Net Annual Interest Income per                  
Unit will change as Bonds are redeemed, paid, sold or exchanged                 
in certain refundings or as the expenses of each Trust change.                  
Therefore, there is no assurance that the Estimated Current Return              
(if applicable) indicated in the "Special Trust Information" for                
each Trust will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term                  
Return is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration         
and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market             
values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums           
and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of all                
of the Bonds in the Trust; (2) takes into account the expenses                  
and sales charge associated with each Unit of a Trust; and (3)                  
takes into effect the tax-adjusted yield from potential capital                 
gains at the Date of Deposit. Since the market values and estimated             
retirements of the Bonds and the expenses of the Trust will change,             
there is no assurance that the Estimated Long-Term Return indicated             
in the "Special Trust Information" for each Trust will be realized              
in the future. Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term                 
Return are expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated              
Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal            
returned while Estimated Current Return calculations include only               
Net Annual Interest Income and Public Offering Price as of the                  
Date of Deposit.  Neither rate reflects the true return to Unit                 
holders, which is lower, because neither includes the effect of                 
certain delays in distributions to Unit holders.                                

In order to acquire certain of the Bonds contracted for by the                  
Sponsor for deposit in a Trust, it may be necessary to pay on                   
the settlement dates for delivery of such Bonds amounts covering                
accrued interest on such Bonds which exceed the amounts furnished               
by the Sponsor. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts                   

Page 12                                                                         

necessary to cover any such excess and will be reimbursed therefor,             
without interest, when funds become available from interest payments            
on the particular Bonds with respect to which such payments have                
been made. Also, since interest on the Bonds in a Trust does not                
begin accruing as tax-exempt interest income to the benefit of                  
Unit holders until their respective dates of delivery, the Trustee              
will, in order to obtain for the Unit holders the estimated net                 
annual interest income during the first year of each Trust's operations         
as is indicated in the "Special Trust Information" for each Trust,              
reduce its fee and, to the extent necessary, pay expenses of each               
Trust in an amount equal to all or a portion of the amount of                   
interest that would have so accrued on such Bonds between the                   
settlement date of units purchased on the Date of Deposit and                   
such dates of delivery. If none of the Bonds in a portfolio has                 
a delivery date after the settlement date of Units purchased on                 
the Date of Deposit, the Trustee will neither reduce its fee nor                
pay expenses of a Trust as described above.                                     

Record Dates for distributions of interest are the fifteenth day                
of each month. The Distribution Dates for distributions of interest             
is the last day of each month in which the related Record Date                  
occurs. Unit holders will receive such distributions, if any,                   
from the Principal Account as are made as of the Record Dates                   
for monthly distributions.                                                      

How is Accrued Interest Treated?                                                

Accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond               
from the last day on which interest thereon was paid. Interest                  
on Bonds generally is paid semi-annually, although the Trust accrues            
such interest daily. Because of this, the Trust always has an                   
amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee.                 
For this reason, with respect to sales settling subsequent to                   
the First Settlement Date, the Public Offering Price of Units                   
will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest               
to the date of settlement. Unit holders will receive on the next                
distribution date of the Trust the amount, if any, of accrued                   
interest paid on their Units.                                                   

In an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would               
otherwise have to be paid in addition to the Public Offering Price              
in the sale of Units to the public, the Trustee will advance the                
amount of accrued interest as of the First Settlement Date and                  
the same will be distributed to the Sponsor as the Unit holder                  
of record as of the First Settlement Date. Consequently, the amount             
of accrued interest to be added to the Public Offering Price of                 
Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement              
Date to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the                 
Interest Account subsequent to the First Settlement Date. See                   
"Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest and Principal Distributed?"            

Because of the varying interest payment dates of the Bonds, accrued             
interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount                   
of interest actually received by the Trust and distributed to                   
Unit holders. Therefore, there will always remain an item of accrued            
interest that is added to the value of the Units. If a Unit holder              
sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he will be entitled             
to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from                 
the purchaser of his Units. Since the Trustee has the use of the                
funds held in the Interest Account for distributions to Unit holders            
and since such Account is non-interest-bearing to Unit holders,                 
the Trustee benefits thereby.                                                   

Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO THE INSURED TRUSTS.              
THE BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO OF AN ADVANTAGE TRUST ARE NOT INSURED                
BY INSURANCE OBTAINED BY THE FUND.                                              

All Bonds in the portfolio of an Insured Trust are insured as                   
to the scheduled payment of interest and principal by policies                  
obtained by each Insured Trust from Financial Guaranty Insurance                
Company ("Financial Guaranty" or "FGIC"), a New York stock insurance            
company, or AMBAC Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity" or                   
"AMBAC"), a Wisconsin-domiciled stock insurance company, or obtained            
by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others prior               
to the Date of Deposit directly from Financial Guaranty, AMBAC                  
Indemnity or other insurers (the "Preinsured Bonds"). The insurance             
policy obtained by each Insured Trust is noncancellable and will                
continue in force for such Trust so long as such Trust is in existence          
and the Bonds described in the policy continue to be held by such               
Trust (see "Portfolio" for each Insured Trust). Nonpayment of                   
premiums on the policy obtained by each Insured Trust will not                  
result in the cancellation                                                      

Page 13                                                                         

of insurance, but will permit Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC                   
Indemnity to take action against the Trustee to recover premium                 
payments due it. Premium rates for each issue of Bonds protected                
by the policy obtained by each Insured Trust are fixed for the                  
life of such Trust. The premium for any Preinsured Bonds has been               
paid in advance by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor               
or others and any such policy or policies are noncancellable and                
will continue in force so long as the Bonds so insured are outstanding          
and the insurer and/or insurers thereof remain in business. If                  
the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable                 
to meet its obligations under such policy, or if the rating assigned            
to the claims-paying ability of such insurer deteriorates, Financial            
Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity has no obligation to insure any                 
issue adversely affected by either of the above described events.               
A monthly premium is paid by each Insured Trust for the insurance               
obtained by such Trust, which is payable from the interest income               
received by such Trust. In the case of Preinsured Bonds, no premiums            
for insurance are paid by the Insured Trust.                                    

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. Under the provisions of                   
the aforementioned portfolio insurance issued by Financial Guaranty,            
Financial Guaranty unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay                
to Citibank, N.A., or its successor, as its agent (the "Fiscal                  
Agent"), that portion of the principal of and interest on the                   
Bonds covered by the policy which shall become due for payment                  
but shall be unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer of the                
Bonds. The term "due for payment" means, when referring to the                  
principal of a Bond, its stated maturity date or the date on which              
it shall have been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption                 
and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due                  
by reason of call for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking               
fund redemption), acceleration or other advancement of maturity                 
and means, when referring to interest on a Bond, the stated date                
for payment of interest, except that when the interest on a Bond                
shall have been determined, as provided in the underlying documentation         
relating to such Bond, to be subject to Federal income taxation,                
"due for payment" also means, when referring to the principal                   
of such Bond, the date on which such Bond has been called for                   
mandatory redemption as a result of such determination of taxability,           
and when referring to interest on such Bond, the accrued interest               
at the rate provided in such documentation to the date on which                 
such Bond has been called for such mandatory redemption, together               
with any applicable redemption premium. The term "due for payment"              
will not include, when referring to either the principal of a                   
Bond or the interest on a Bond, any acceleration of payment unless              
such acceleration is at the sole option of Financial Guaranty.                  

Financial Guaranty will make such payments to the Fiscal Agent                  
on the date such principal or interest becomes due for payment                  
or on the business day next following the day on which Financial                
Guaranty shall have received notice of nonpayment, whichever is                 
later. The Fiscal Agent will disburse to the Trustee the face                   
amount of principal and interest which is then due for payment                  
but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer but only upon               
receipt by the Fiscal Agent of (i) evidence of the Trustee's right              
to receive payment of the principal or interest due for payment                 
and (ii) evidence, including any appropriate instruments of assignment,         
that all of the rights to payment of such principal or interest                 
due for payment shall thereupon vest in Financial Guaranty. Upon                
such disbursement, Financial Guaranty shall become the owner of                 
the Bond, appurtenant coupon or right to payment of principal                   
or interest on such Bond and shall be fully subrogated to all                   
of the Trustee's rights thereunder, including the right to payment              
thereof.                                                                        

Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of Financial Guaranty, the                
Trustee, upon the sale of a Bond covered under a policy obtained                
by an Insured Trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance                 
with respect to such Bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the                   
Bonds regardless of the identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent         
Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance                
premium from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond. Accordingly,                
any Bond in an Insured Trust is eligible to be sold on an insured               
basis. It is expected that the Trustee will exercise the right                  
to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such exercise the Insured            
Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of Bond proceeds less the                
insurance premium attributable to the Permanent Insurance) from                 
such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such Bonds were sold                
on an uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to each               
Bond eligible for Permanent Insurance is determined                             

Page 14                                                                         

based upon the insurability of each Bond as of the Date of Deposit              
and will not be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness   
of such Bond.                                                                   

Financial Guaranty is a wholly owned subsidiary of FGIC Corporation

The information relating to Financial Guaranty contained above                  
has been furnished by such corporation. The financial information               
contained herein with respect to such corporation is unaudited                  
but appears in reports or other materials filed with state insurance            
regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review by such               
authorities. No representation is made herein as to the accuracy                
or adequacy of such information or as to the absence of material

AMBAC Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity"). The Insurance                  
Policy of AMBAC Indemnity obtained by an Insured Trust is noncancellable        
and will continue in force for so long as the Bonds described                   
in the Insurance Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly                 
premium is paid by an Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained           
by it. The Trustee will pay, when due, successively, the full                   
amount of each installment of the insurance premium. Pursuant                   
to a binding agreement with AMBAC Indemnity, in the event of a                  
sale of a Bond covered by the AMBAC Indemnity Insurance Policy,                 
the Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance for such                
Bond upon payment of a single predetermined premium from the proceeds           
of the sale of such Bond.                                                       

Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, AMBAC Indemnity agrees                 
to pay to the Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest             
on the Bonds insured by AMBAC Indemnity which shall become due                  
for payment but shall be unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the                  
issuer of the Bonds. The term "due for payment" means, when referring           
to the principal of a Bond so insured, its stated maturity date                 
or the date on which it shall have been called for mandatory sinking            
fund redemption and does not refer to any earlier date on which                 
payment is due by reason of call for redemption (other than by                  
mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration or other advancement           
of maturity and means, when referring to interest on a Bond, the                
stated date for payment of interest.                                            

AMBAC Indemnity will make payment to the Trustee not later than                 
thirty days after notice from the Trustee is received by AMBAC                  
Indemnity that a nonpayment of principal or of interest on a Bond               
has occurred, but not earlier than the date on which the Bonds                  
are due for payment. AMBAC Indemnity will disburse to the Trustee               
the face amount of principal and interest which is then due for                 
payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer in                  
exchange for delivery of Bonds, not less in face amount than the                
amount of the payment in bearer form, free and clear of all liens               
and encumbrances and uncancelled. In cases where Bonds are issuable             
only in a form whereby principal is payable to registered holders               
or their assigns, AMBAC Indemnity shall pay principal only upon                 
presentation and surrender of the unpaid Bonds uncancelled and                  
free of any adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment            
in satisfactory form, so as to permit ownership of such Bonds                   
to be registered in the name of AMBAC Indemnity or its nominee.                 
In cases where Bonds are issuable only in a form whereby interest               
is payable to registered holders or their assigns, AMBAC Indemnity              
shall pay interest only upon presentation of proof that the claimant            
is the person entitled to the payment of interest on the Bonds                  
and delivery of an instrument of assignment, in satisfactory form,              
transferring

to AMBAC Indemnity all right under such Bonds to receive the interest           
in respect of which the insurance payment was made.

The information relating to AMBAC Indemnity contained above has                 
been furnished by AMBAC Indemnity. No representation is made herein             
as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the                
existence of any adverse changes in such information, subsequent                
to the date hereof.                                                             

In determining whether to insure bonds, Financial Guaranty and/or               
AMBAC Indemnity has applied its own standards which are not necessarily         
the same as the criteria used in regard to the selection of bonds               
by the Sponsor. This decision is made prior to the Date of Deposit,             
as bonds not covered by such insurance are not deposited in an                  
Insured Trust, unless such bonds are Preinsured Bonds. The insurance            
obtained by an Insured Trust covers Bonds deposited in such Trust               
and physically delivered to the Trustee in the case of bearer                   
bonds or registered in the name of the Trustee or its nominee                   
or delivered along with an assignment in the case of registered                 
bonds or registered in the name of the Trustee or its nominee                   
in the case of Bonds held in book-entry form. Contracts to purchase             
Bonds are not covered by the insurance obtained by an Insured                   
Trust although Bonds underlying such contracts are covered by                   
insurance upon physical delivery to the Trustee.                                

Insurance obtained by each Insured Trust or by the Bond issuer,                 
the underwriters, the Sponsor or others does not guarantee the                  
market value of the Bonds or the value of the Units of such Trust.              
The insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is effective only as                 
to Bonds owned by and held in such Trust. In the event of a sale                
of any such Bond by the Trustee, the insurance terminates as to                 
such Bond on the date of sale. In the event of a sale of a Bond                 
insured by an Insured Trust, the Trustee has the right to obtain                
Permanent Insurance upon the payment of an insurance premium from               
the proceeds of the sale of such Bond. Except as indicated below,               
insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no effect on the price               
or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of the                
Evaluator to attribute a value to such insurance obtained by an                 
Insured Trust (including the right to obtain Permanent Insurance)               
for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of                   
Units only if the Bonds covered by such insurance are in default                
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion,               
in significant risk of such default. The value of the insurance                 
will be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of                 
a Bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest                  
or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of                 
the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premium             
attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii)                   
the market value of such Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance.              
See "Public Offering-How is the Public Offering Price Determined?"              
herein for a more complete description of the Evaluator's method                
of valuing defaulted Bonds and Bonds which have a significant                   
risk of default. Insurance on a Preinsured Bond is effective as                 
long as such Bond is outstanding. Therefore, any such insurance                 
may be considered to represent an element of market value in regard             
to the Bonds thus insured, but the exact effect, if any, of this                
insurance on such market value cannot be predicted.                             

A contract of insurance obtained by an Insured Trust and the negotiations       
in respect thereof represent the only relationship between Financial            
Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity and the Fund. Otherwise neither                 

Page 16                                                                         

Financial Guaranty nor its parent, FGIC Corporation, or any affiliate           
thereof, nor AMBAC Indemnity nor its parent, AMBAC, Inc., or any                
affiliate thereof has any significant relationship, direct or                   
indirect, with the Fund or the Sponsor, except that the Sponsor                 
has in the past and may from time to time in the future, in the                 
normal course of its business, participate as sole underwriter                  
or as manager or as a member of underwriting syndicates in the                  
distribution of new issues of municipal bonds in which the investors            
or the affiliates of FGIC Corporation and/or AMBAC Inc. have or                 
will be participants or for which a policy of insurance guaranteeing            
the scheduled payment of interest and principal has been obtained               
from Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity. Neither the Fund                
nor the Units of a Trust nor the portfolio of such Trust is insured             
directly or indirectly by FGIC Corporation and/or AMBAC Inc.

by such rating agencies.                                                        

CapMAC is wholly owned by CapMAC Holdings Inc. ("Holdings"), a                  
company that is owned by a group of institutional and other investors,          
including CapMAC's management and employees. CapMAC commenced                   
operations on December 24, 1987 as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary         
of Citibank (New York State), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citicorp.            
On June 25, 1992, Citibank (New York State) sold CapMAC to Holdings             
(the "Sale").                                                                   

Neither Holdings nor any of its stockholders is obligated to pay                
any claims under any surety bond issued by CapMAC or any debts                  
of CapMAC or to make additional capital contributions.                          

CapMAC is regulated by the Superintendent of Insurance of the                   
State of New York. In addition, CapMAC is subject to regulation                 
by the insurance departments of the other jurisdictions in which                
it is licensed. CapMAC is subject to periodic regulatory examinations           
by the same regulatory authorities.                                             

CapMAC is bound by insurance laws and regulations regarding capital             
transfers, limitations upon dividends, investment of assets, changes            
in control, transactions with affiliates and consolidations and                 
acquisitions. The amount of exposure per risk that CapMAC may                   
retain, after giving effect to reinsurance, collateral or other                 
securities, is also regulated. Statutory and regulatory accounting              
practices may prescribe appropriate rates at which premiums are                 
earned and the levels of reserves required. In addition, various                
insurance laws restrict the incurrence of debt, regulate permissible            
investments of reserves, capital and surplus, and govern the form               
of surety bonds.                                                                

CapMAC's obligations under the Surety Bond(s) may be reinsured.                 
Such reinsurance does not relieve CapMAC of any of its obligations              
under the Surety Bond(s).                                                       

THE SURETY BONDS ARE NOT COVERED BY THE PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE             
SECURITY FUND SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 76 OF THE NEW YORK INSURANCE                 
LAW.                                                                            

In connection with the Sale, Holdings and CapMAC entered into                   
an Ownership Policy Agreement (the "Ownership Policy Agreement"),               
which sets forth Holdings' intent with respect to its ownership                 
and control of CapMAC and provides for certain policies and agreements          
with respect to Holdings' exercise of its control of CapMAC. In                 
the Ownership Policy Agreement, Holdings has agreed that, during                
the term of the Ownership Policy Agreement, it will not and will                
not permit any stockholder of Holdings to enter into any transaction            
the result of which would be a change of control (as defined in                 
the Ownership Policy Agreement) of CapMAC, unless the long-term                 
debt obligations or claims-paying ability of the person which                   
would control CapMAC after such transaction or its direct or indirect           
parent are rated in a high investment grade category, unless Holdings           
or CapMAC has confirmed that CapMAC's claims-paying ability rating              
by Moody's (the "Rating") in effect immediately prior to any such               
change of control will not be downgraded by Moody's upon such                   
change of control or unless such change of control occurs as a                  
result of a public offering of Holdings' capital stock.                         

In addition, the Ownership Policy Agreement includes agreements                 
(i) not to change the "zero-loss" underwriting standards or policies            
and procedures of CapMAC in a manner that would materially and                  
adversely affect the risk profile of CapMAC's book of business,                 
(ii) that CapMAC will adhere to the aggregate leverage limitations              
and maintain capitalization levels considered by Moody's from                   
time to time as consistent with maintaining CapMAC's Rating and                 
(iii) that until CapMAC's statutory capital surplus and contingency             
reserve ("qualified statutory capital") equal $250 million, CapMAC              
will maintain a specified amount of qualified statutory capital                 
in excess of the amount of qualified statutory capital that CapMAC              
is required at such time to maintain under the aggregate leverage               
limitations set forth in Article 69 of the New York Insurance                   
Law.                                                                            

Page 18                                                                         

The Ownership Policy Agreement will terminate on the earlier of                 
the date on which a change of control of CapMAC occurs and the                  
date on which CapMAC and Holdings agree in writing to terminate                 
the Ownership Policy Agreement; provided that, CapMAC or Holdings               
has confirmed that CapMAC's Rating in effect immediately prior                  
to any such termination will not be downgraded upon such termination.           

As of December 31, 1992 and 1991, CapMAC had statutory capital                  
and surplus of approximately $148 million and $232 million, respectively,       
and had not incurred any debt obligations. On June 26, 1992, CapMAC             
made a special distribution (the "Distribution") to Holdings in                 
connection with the Sale in an aggregate amount that caused the                 
total of CapMAC's statutory capital and surplus to decline to                   
approximately $150 million. Holdings applied substantially all                  
of the proceeds of the Distribution to repay debt owed to Citicorp              
that was incurred in connection with the capitalization of CapMAC.              
As of June 30, 1992, CapMAC had statutory capital and surplus                   
of approximately $150 million and had not incurred any debt obligations.        
In addition, on December 31, 1992 CapMAC had a statutory contingency            
reserve of approximately $15 million, which is also available                   
to cover claims under surety bonds issued by CapMAC. Article 69                 
of the New York State Insurance Law requires that CapMAC establishes            
and maintains the contingency reserve.                                          

In addition to its capital (including contingency reserve) and                  
other reinsurance available to pay claims under its surety bonds,               
on June 25, 1992, CapMAC entered into a Stop Loss Reinsurance                   
Agreement (the "Stop Loss Agreement") with Winterthur Swiss Insurance           
Company (the "Reinsurer"), which is rated AAA by Standard & Poor's              
and Aaa by Moody's, pursuant to which the Reinsurer will be required            
to pay any losses incurred by CapMAC during the term of the Stop                
Loss Agreement on the surety bonds covered under the Stop Loss                  
Agreement in excess of a specified amount of losses incurred by                 
CapMAC under such surety bonds (such specified amount initially                 
being $100 million and increasing annually by an amount equal                   
to 66 2/3% of the increase in CapMAC's statutory capital and surplus)           
up to an aggregate limit payable under the Stop Loss Agreement                  
of $50 million. The Stop Loss Agreement has an initial term of                  
seven years, is extendable for one-year periods and is subject                  
to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events.                     

CapMAC also has available a $100,000,000 standby corporate liquidity            
facility (the "Liquidity Facility") provided by a syndicate of                  
banks rated A1+/P1 by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively,              
having a term of 360 days. Under the Liquidity Facility CapMAC                  
will be able, subject to satisfying certain conditions, to borrow               
funds from time to time in order to enable it to fund any claim                 
payments or payments made in settlement or mitigation of claims                 
payments under its surety bonds, including the Surety Bond(s).                  

Copies of CapMAC's financial statements prepared in accordance                  
with statutory accounting standards, which differ from generally                
accepted accounting principles, and filed with the Insurance Department         
of the State of New York are available upon request. CapMAC is

Financial Security Assurance. Financial Security Assurance ("Financial          
Security") is a monoline insurance company incorporated on March                
16, 1984 under the laws of the State of New York. The operations                
of Financial Security commenced on July 25, 1985, and Financial                 
Security received its New York State insurance license on September             
23, 1985. Financial Security and its two wholly owned subsidiaries              
are licensed to engage in the financial guaranty insurance business             
in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.                         

Financial Security and its subsidiaries are engaged exclusively                 
in the business of writing financial guaranty insurance, principally            
in respect of asset-backed and other collateralized securities                  
offered in domestic and foreign markets. Financial Security and                 
its subsidiaries also write financial guaranty insurance in respect             
of municipal and other obligations and reinsure financial guaranty              
insurance policies written by other leading insurance companies.                
In general, financial guaranty insurance consists of the issuance               
of a guaranty of scheduled payments of an issuer's securities,                  
thereby enhancing the credit rating of those securities, in consideration       
for payment of a premium to the insurer.                                        

Financial Security is approximately 91.6% owned by US West, Inc.                
and 8.4% owned by The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.                 
("Tokio Marine"). US West, Inc. operates businesses involved in                 
communications, data solutions, marketing services and capital                  
assets, including the provision of telephone services                           

Page 19                                                                         

in 14 states in the western and mid-western United States. Tokio                
Marine is the largest property and casualty insurance company                   
in Japan. No shareholder of Financial Security is obligated to                  
pay any debt of Financial Security or any claim under any insurance             
policy issued by Financial Security or to make any additional                   
contribution to the capital of Financial Security.                              

As of March 31, 1993, the total policyholders' surplus and contingency          
reserves and the total unearned premium reserve, respectively,                  
of Financial Security and its consolidated subsidiaries were,                   
in accordance with statutory accounting principles, approximately               
$479,110,000 (unaudited) and $220,078,000 (unaudited), and the                  
total shareholders' equity and the unearned premium reserve, respectively,      
of Financial Security and its consolidated subsidiaries were,                   
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, approximately      
$628,119,000 (unaudited), and $202,493,000 (unaudited). Copies                  
of Financial Security's financial statements may be obtained by                 
writing to Financial Security at 350 Park Avenue, New York, New                 
York, 10022, Attention Communications Department. Financial Security's          
telephone number is (212) 826-0100.                                             

Pursuant to an intercompany agreement, liabilities on financial                 
guaranty insurance written by Financial Security or either of                   
its subsidiaries are reinsured among such companies on an agreed-upon           
percentage substantially proportional to their respective capital,              
surplus and reserves, subject to applicable statutory risk limitations.         
In addition, Financial Security reinsures a portion of its liabilities          
under certain of its financial guaranty insurance policies with                 
unaffiliated reinsurers under various quota share treaties and                  
on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Such reinsurance is utilized             
by Financial Security as a risk management device and to comply                 
with certain statutory and rating agency requirements; it does                  
not alter or limit Financial Security's obligations under any                   
financial guaranty insurance policy.                                            

Financial Security's claims-paying ability is rated "Aaa" by Moody's            
Investors Service, Inc, and "AAA" by Standard & Poor's Corporation,             
Nippon Investors Service Inc., Duff & Phelps Inc. and Australian                
Ratings Pty. Ltd. Such ratings reflect only the views of the respective         
rating agencies, are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold                   
securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time                
by such rating agencies.                                                        

Because the Bonds in each Insured Trust are insured as to the                   
scheduled payment of principal and interest and on the basis of                 
the financial condition of the insurance companies referred to                  
above, Standard & Poor's Corporation has assigned to units of                   
each Insured Trust its "AAA" investment rating. This is the highest             
rating assigned to securities by Standard & Poor's Corporation.                 
See "Description of Bond Ratings." The obtaining of this rating                 
by each Insured Trust should not be construed as an approval of                 
the offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's Corporation or                   
as a guarantee of the market value of each Insured Trust or the                 
Units of such Trust. Standard & Poor's Corporation has indicated                
that this rating is not a recommendation to buy, hold or sell                   
Units nor does it take into account the extent to which expenses                
of each Trust or sales by each Trust of Bonds for less than the                 
purchase price paid by such Trust will reduce payment to Unit                   
holders of the interest and principal required to be paid on such               
Bonds. There is no guarantee that the "AAA" investment rating                   
with respect to the Units of an Insured Trust will be maintained.               

An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by such Insured Trust              
is to obtain a higher yield on the Bonds in the portfolio of such               
Trust than would be available if all the Bonds in such portfolio                
had the Standard & Poor's Corporation "AAA" and/or Moody's Investors            
Service, Inc. "Aaa" rating(s) and at the same time to have the                  
protection of insurance of scheduled payment of interest and principal          
on the Bonds. There is, of course, no certainty that this result                
will be achieved. Bonds in a Trust for which insurance has been                 
obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or                   
others (all of which were rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's Corporation          
and/or "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.) may or may not                 
have a higher yield than uninsured bonds rated "AAA" by Standard                
& Poor's Corporation or "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.                
In selecting Bonds for the portfolio of each Insured Trust, the                 
Sponsor has applied the criteria herein before described.                       

Chapman and Cutler, Counsel for the Sponsor, has given an opinion               
(if applicable) to the effect that the payment of insurance proceeds            
representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal obligations               
paid by Financial Guaranty or another insurer would be excludable               
from Federal gross income if, and to the same extent                            

Page 20                                                                         

as, such interest would have been so excludable if paid by the                  
issuer of the defaulted obligations. See "What is the Federal
Tax Status of Unit Holders?"

What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?                                 

At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating             
to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon                
from Federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the                  
respective issuing authorities. Neither the Sponsor, Chapman and                
Cutler, nor any of the Special Counsel to the Fund for State tax                
matters have made any special review for the Fund of the proceedings            
relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for such                  
opinions. Gain realized on the sale or redemption of the Bonds                  
by the Trustee or of a Unit by a Unit holder is, however, includable            
in gross income for Federal income tax purposes. (It should be                  
noted in this connection that such gain does not include any amounts            
received in respect of accrued interest or accrued original issue               
discount, if any.) It should be noted that under provisions of                  
the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the "Tax Act") described                
below that subject accretion of market discount on tax-exempt                   
bonds to taxation as ordinary income, gain realized on the sale                 
or redemption of Bonds by the Trustee or of Units by a Unit holder              
that would have been treated as capital gain under prior law is                 
treated as ordinary income to the extent it is attributable to                  
accretion of market discount. Market discount can arise based                   
on the price a Trust pays for Bonds or the price a Unit holder                  
pays for his Units.                                                             

In the opinion of Chapman and Cutler, Counsel for the Sponsor,                  
under existing law:                                                             

(1)     the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for             
Federal income tax purposes. Tax-exempt interest received by each               
of the Trusts on Bonds deposited therein will retain its status                 
as tax-exempt interest, for Federal income tax purposes, when                   
distributed to a Unit holder except that (i) interest income on                 
certain Bonds in the Kansas Insured Trust will be included as                   
an item of tax preference in calculating the Alternative Minimum                
Tax applicable to both individuals and corporations and (ii) the                
alternative minimum tax and the environmental tax (the "Superfund               
Tax") applicable to corporate Unit holders may, in certain circumstances,       
include in the amount on which such tax is calculated, 75% of                   
the interest income received by the Trust. See "Certain Tax Matters
Applicable to Corporate Unit Holders;"                                          

(2)     exemption of interest and accrued original issue discount               
on any Bonds for Federal income tax purposes does not necessarily               
result in tax exemption under the laws of the several states as                 
such laws vary with respect to the taxation of such securities                  
and in many states all or a part of such interest and accrued                   
original issue discount may be subject to tax;                                  

(3)     each Unit holder of a Trust is considered to be the owner               
of a pro rata portion of such Trust under subpart E, subchapter                 
J of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (hereinafter                
the "Code") and will have a taxable event when the Trust disposes               
of a Bond, or when the Unit holder redeems or sells his Units.                  
Unit holders must reduce the tax basis of their Units for their                 
share of accrued interest received, if any, on Bonds delivered                  
after the date the Unit holders pay for their Units and, consequently,          
such Unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction             
in capital loss upon the disposition of such Units. Gain or loss                
upon the sale or redemption of Units is measured by comparing                   
the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis                 
of the Units. If the Trustee disposes of Bonds (whether by sale,                
payment on maturity, redemption or otherwise), gain or loss is                  
recognized to the Unit holder. The amount of any such gain or                   
loss is measured by comparing the Unit holder's pro rata share                  
of the total proceeds from such disposition with his basis for                  
his fractional interest in the asset disposed of. In the case                   
of a Unit holder who purchases his Units, such basis is determined              
by apportioning the tax basis for the Units among each of the                   
Trust assets ratably according to value as of the date of acquisition           
of the Units. The basis of each Unit and of each Bond which was                 
issued with original issue discount must be increased by the amount             
of accrued original issue discount and the basis of each Unit                   
and of each Bond which was purchased by a Trust at a premium must               
be reduced by the annual amortization of Bond premium. The tax                  
cost reduction requirements                                                     

Page 21                                                                         

of said Code relating to amortization of bond premium may, under                
some circumstances, result in the Unit holder realizing a taxable               
gain when his Units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to                 
or less than his original cost; and                                             

(4)     any insurance proceeds which represent maturing interest                
on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will be excludable                 
from Federal gross income if, and to the same extent as, such                   
interest would have been so excludable if paid by the issuer of                 
the defaulted obligations.                                                      

Sections 1288 and 1272 of the Code provide a complex set of rules               
governing the accrual of original issue discount. These rules                   
provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis                
of a constant compounded interest rate or ratably over the term                 
of the Bond, depending on the date the Bond was issued. In addition,            
special rules apply if the purchase price of a Bond exceeds the                 
original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount                 
which would have accrued to prior owners. The application of these              
rules will also vary depending on the value of the Bond on the                  
date a Unit holder acquires his Unit, and the price the Unit holder             
pays for his Unit. Because of the complexity of these rules relating            
to the accrual of original issue discount, Unit holders should                  
consult their tax advisers as to how these rules apply. See "Portfolio"         
for information relating to Bonds, if any, issued at an original                
issue discount.                                                                 

The Tax Act subjects tax-exempt bonds to the market discount rules              
of the Code effective for bonds purchased after April 30, 1993.                 
In general, market discount is the amount (if any) by which the                 
stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investor's purchase              
price (except to the extent that such difference, if any, is attributable       
to original issue discount not yet accrued). Under the Tax Act,                 
accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income; under               
prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain. Market                
discount that accretes while a Trust holds a Bond would be recognized           
as ordinary income by the Unit holders when principal payments                  
are received on the Bond, upon sale or at redemption (including                 
early redemption) or upon the sale or redemption of the Units,                  
unless a Unit holder elects to include market discount in taxable               
income as it accrues. The market discount rules are complex and                 
Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these                  
rules and their application.                                                    

Counsel for the Sponsor has also advised that under Section 265                 
of the Code, interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to                  
purchase or carry Units of a Trust is not deductible for Federal                
income tax purposes. The Internal Revenue Service has taken the                 
position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable                  
to the purchase or carrying of Units (however, these rules generally            
do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase              
or improve a personal residence). Under Section 265 of the Code,                
certain financial institutions that acquire Units generally would               
not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable                  
to ownership of Units. Investors with questions regarding these                 
issues should consult with their tax advisers.                                  

In the case of certain of the Bonds in a Trust, the opinions of                 
bond counsel indicate that interest on such securities received                 
by a "substantial user" of the facilities being financed with                   
the proceeds of these securities, or persons related thereto,                   
for periods while such securities are held by such a user or related            
person, will not be excludable from Federal gross income, although              
interest on such securities received by others would be excludable              
from Federal gross income. "Substantial user" and "related person"              
are defined under U.S. Treasury Regulations. Any person who believes            
he or she may be a substantial user or related person as so defined             
should contact his tax adviser.                                                 

In general, Section 86 of the Code provides that Social Security                
benefits are includible in gross income in an amount equal to                   
the lesser of (1) 50% of the Social Security benefits received                  
or (2) 50% of the excess of "modified adjusted gross income" plus               
50% of the Social Security benefits received over the appropriate               
"base amount." The base amount is $25,000 for unmarried taxpayers,              
$32,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for                
married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the                 
taxable year and who file separate returns. Modified adjusted                   
gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard                 
to certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from                   
gross income and by including tax-exempt interest. To the extent                
that Social Security benefits are includible in gross income,                   
they will be treated as any other item of gross income.                         

Page 22                                                                         

In addition, under the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after               
December 31, 1993, up to 85% of Social Security benefits are includible         
in gross income to the extent that the sum of "modified adjusted                
gross income" plus 50% of Social Security benefits received exceeds             
an "adjusted base amount." The adjusted base amount is $34,000                  
for unmarried taxpayers, $44,000 for married taxpayers filing                   
a joint return, and zero for married taxpayers who do not live                  
apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate                
returns.                                                                        

Although tax-exempt interest is included in modified adjusted                   
gross income solely for the purpose of determining what portion,                
if any, of Social Security benefits will be included in gross                   
income, no tax-exempt interest, including that received from a                  
Trust, will be subject to tax. A taxpayer whose adjusted gross                  
income already exceeds the base amount or the adjusted base amount              
must include 50% or 85%, respectively, of his Social Security                   
benefits in gross income whether or not he receives any tax-exempt              
interest. A taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income (after                
inclusion of tax-exempt interest) does not exceed the base amount               
need not include any Social Security benefits in gross income.                  

For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals           
and corporations and the Superfund Tax for corporations, interest               
on certain private activity bonds (which includes most industrial               
and housing revenue bonds) issued on or after August 8, 1986 is                 
included as an item of tax preference. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN            
BONDS IN THE KANSAS INSURED TRUST, THE TRUSTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY                
SUCH PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS ISSUED ON OR AFTER THAT DATE.                       

For taxpayers other than corporations, net capital gains are presently          
subject to a maximum stated marginal tax rate of 28 percent. However,           
it should be noted that legislative proposals are introduced from               
time to time that affect tax rates and could affect relative differences        
at which ordinary income and capital gains are taxed. All taxpayers             
are presently required to disclose to the Internal Revenue Service              
the amount of tax-exempt interest earned during the year.                       

Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit Holders. Present               
Federal income tax law also provides for an alternative minimum                 
tax for corporations levied at a rate of 20% of alternative minimum             
taxable income. The alternative minimum tax and the environmental               
tax (the "Superfund Tax") depend upon the corporation's alternative             
minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is the corporation's taxable             
income with certain adjustments. One of the adjustment items used               
in computing AMTI of a corporation (excluding an S Corporation,                 
Regulated Investment Company, Real Estate Investment Trust, or                  
REMIC) is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such corporation's            
"adjusted current earnings" over an amount equal to its AMTI (before            
such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss                 
deduction). Although tax-exempt interest received by the Trusts                 
on Bonds deposited therein will not be included in the gross income             
of corporations for Federal income tax purposes, "adjusted current              
earnings" includes all tax-exempt interest, including interest                  
on all Bonds in the Trusts.                                                     

Unit holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers with                   
respect to the particular tax consequences to them, including                   
the corporate alternative minimum tax, the Superfund Tax and the                
branch profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the Code.                          

In the opinion of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, Special Counsel to                 
the Fund for New York tax matters, under the existing income tax                
laws of the State and City of New York, each Trust will not constitute          
an association taxable as a corporation under New York law, and                 
accordingly will not be subject to the New York State franchise                 
tax or the New York City general corporation tax. Under the income              
tax laws of the State and City of New York, the income of each                  
Trust will be considered the income of the holders of the Units.                

For information with respect to exemption from state or other                   
local taxes, see the sections in the Prospectus pertaining to                   
each Trust.                                                                     

All statements in the Prospectus concerning exemption from Federal,             
state or other local taxes are the opinions of Counsel and are                  
to be so construed.                                                             

What are the Expenses and Charges?                                              

At no cost to the Trusts, the Sponsor has borne all the expenses                
of creating and establishing the Fund, including the cost of the                
initial preparation, printing and execution of the Indenture and                
the certificates for the Units, legal and accounting expenses,                  
expenses of the Trustee and other out-of-pocket expenses. The                   
Sponsor                                                                         

Page 23                                                                         

will not receive any fees in connection with its activities relating            
to the Trust. However, First Trust Advisors L.P., an affiliate                  
of the Sponsor, will receive an annual supervisory fee, which                   
is not to exceed the amount set forth under "Summary of Essential
Information," for providing portfolio supervisory services for                  
the Trust. Such fee is based on the number of Units outstanding                 
in each Trust on January 1 of each year except for Trusts which                 
were established subsequent to the last January 1, in which case                
the fee will be based on the number of Units outstanding in such                
Trusts as of the respective Dates of Deposit. The fee may exceed                
the actual costs of providing such supervisory services for this                
Fund, but at no time will the total amount received for portfolio               
supervisory services rendered to unit investment trusts of which                
Nike Securities L.P. is the Sponsor in any calendar year exceed                 
the aggregate cost to First Trust Advisors L.P. of supplying such               
services in such year.                                                          

For each valuation of the Bonds in a Trust after the initial public             
offering period, the Evaluator will receive a fee as indicated                  
in the "Summary of Essential Information." The Trustee pays certain             
expenses of the Trusts for which it is reimbursed by the Trust                  
or Trusts. After the first year the Trustee will receive for its                
ordinary recurring services to a Trust a fee as indicated in the                
"Special Trust Information" for each Trust. During the first year               
the Trustee has agreed to lower its fee and, to the extent necessary,           
pay expenses of the Trust in the amount, if any, stated under                   
"Special Trust Information" for each Trust. For a discussion of                 
the services performed by the Trustee pursuant to its obligations               
under the Indenture, reference is made to the material set forth                
under "Rights of Unit Holders." Bankers Trust Company issued the                
irrevocable letter of credit for the Fund and provides a line                   
of credit which the Sponsor may utilize to acquire securities                   
(which may include certain of the Bonds deposited in the Fund).                 
The Trustee's and Evaluator's fees are payable monthly on or before             
each Distribution Date from the Interest Account of each Trust                  
to the extent funds are available and then from the Principal                   
Account of such Trust. Since the Trustee has the use of the funds               
being held in the Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions,     
payment of expenses and redemptions and since such Accounts are                 
non-interest-bearing to Unit holders, the Trustee benefits thereby.             
Part of the Trustee's compensation for its services to the Fund                 
is expected to result from the use of these funds. Both fees may                
be increased without approval of the Unit holders by amounts not                
exceeding proportionate increases under the category "All Services              
Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index published by                  
the United States Department of Labor.                                          

The aggregate cost of the portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured            
Trust is indicated in Note 1 of "Notes to Portfolios." The portfolio            
insurance continues so long as such Trust retains the Bonds thus                
insured. Premiums are payable monthly in advance by the Trustee                 
on behalf of such Trust. The Trustee will advance the initial                   
premium for the portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust                
and will recover its advancement without interest or other costs                
to such Trust from interest received on Bonds in such Trust. As                 
Bonds in the portfolio are redeemed by their respective issuers                 
or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of premium will be reduced               
in respect of those Bonds no longer owned by and held in the Trust              
which were insured by insurance obtained by such Trust. Preinsured              
Bonds in an Insured Trust are not insured by such Trust. The premium            
payable for Permanent Insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds           
of the sale of such Bond in the event the Trustee exercises the                 
right to obtain Permanent Insurance on a Bond. The premiums for                 
such Permanent Insurance with respect to each Bond will decline                 
over the life of the Bond. An Advantage Trust is not insured;                   
accordingly, there are no premiums for insurance payable by such                
Trust.                                                                          

The following additional charges are or may be incurred by a Trust:             
all expenses (including legal and annual auditing expenses) of                  
the Trustee incurred by or in connection with its responsibilities              
under the Indenture, except in the event of negligence, bad faith               
or willful misconduct on its part; the expenses and costs of any                
action undertaken by the Trustee to protect the Trust and the                   
rights and interests of the Unit holders; fees of the Trustee                   
for any extraordinary services performed under the Indenture;                   
indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or expense               
incurred by it without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct              
on its part, arising out of or in connection with its acceptance                
or administration of the Trust; indemnification of the Sponsor                  
for any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence,           
bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as Depositor of the                   
Trust; all taxes and other government charges imposed upon the                  
Bonds or any                                                                    

Page 24                                                                         

part of the Trust (no such taxes or charges are being levied or                 
made or, to the knowledge of the Sponsor contemplated); and expenditures        
incurred in contacting Unit holders upon termination of the Trust.              
The above expenses and the Trustee's annual fee, when paid or                   
owing to the Trustee, are secured by a lien on the Trust. In addition,          
the Trustee is empowered to sell Bonds of a Trust in order to                   
make funds available to pay all these amounts if funds are not                  
otherwise available in the Interest and Principal Accounts of                   
the Trust.                                                                      

Unless the Sponsor determines that such an audit is not required,               
the Indenture requires the accounts of each Trust shall be audited              
on an annual basis at the expense of the Trust by independent                   
auditors selected by the Sponsor. So long as the Sponsor is making              
a secondary market for Units, the Sponsor shall bear the cost                   
of such annual audits to the extent such cost exceeds $.50 per                  
Unit. Unit holders of a Trust covered by an audit may obtain a                  
copy of the audited financial statements from the Trustee upon                  
request.                                                                        

PUBLIC OFFERING               

How is the Public Offering Price Determined?                                    

Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial              
offering period, the Public Offering Price is determined by adding              
to the Evaluator's determination of the aggregate offering price                
of the Bonds in each Trust, an amount as indicated in the following             
table. During the initial offering period, the Sponsor's Repurchase             
Price is equal to the Evaluator's determination of the aggregate                
offering price of the Bonds in a Trust. A National Trust consists               
of The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds. A State Trust consists           
of The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-Multi-State and/or                
The First Trust Advantage other than an Intermediate, Long Intermediate,

The Public Offering Price of Units of a Trust for secondary market              
purchases will be determined by adding to the Evaluator's determination         
of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds in a Trust, the appropriate             
sales charge determined in accordance with the schedule set forth               
below, based upon the number of years remaining to the maturity                 
of each Bond in the portfolio of the Trust, adjusting the total                 
to reflect the amount of any cash held in or advanced to the principal          
account of the Trust and dividing the result by the number of                   
Units                                                                           

Page 25                                                                         

of such trust then outstanding. The minimum sales charge on Units               
will be 3% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to 3.093%                   
of the net amount invested). For purposes of computation, Bonds                 
will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless:              
(a) the Bonds have been called for redemption or funds or securities            
have been placed in escrow to redeem them on an earlier call date,              
in which case such call date will be deemed to be the date upon                 
which they mature; or (b) such Bonds are subject to a "mandatory                
tender," in which case such mandatory tender will be deemed to                  
be the date upon which they mature.                                             

The effect of this method of sales charge computation will be                   
that different sales charge rates will be applied to each of the                
various Bonds in the Trust based upon the maturities of such bonds,             
in accordance with the following schedule:

There will be no reduction of the sales charges for volume purchases            
for secondary market transactions. A dealer will receive from                   
the Sponsor a dealer concession of 70% of the total sales charges               
for Units sold by such dealer and dealers will not be eligible                  
for additional concessions for Units sold pursuant to the above                 
schedule.                                                                       

An investor may aggregate purchases of Units of two or more consecutive         
series of a particular State, National, Discount, Intermediate,                 
Long Intermediate or Short Intermediate Trust for purposes of                   
calculating the discount for volume purchases listed above. Additionally,       
with respect to the employees and officers (including their immediate           
families and trustees, custodians or a fiduciary for the benefit                
of such person) of Nike Securities L.P., the sales charge is reduced            
by 2% of the Public Offering Price for purchases of Units during                
the initial and secondary offering periods.                                     

Any such reduced sales charge shall be the responsibility of the                
selling Underwriter or dealer except that with respect to purchases             
of Units of $500,000 or more, the Sponsor will reimburse the selling            
Underwriter or dealer in an amount equal to $2.50 per Unit (in                  
the case of a Discount Trust, .25% of the Public Offering Price).               
The reduced sales charge structure will apply on all purchases                  
of Units in a Trust by the same person on any one day from any                  
one Underwriter or dealer and, for purposes of calculating the                  
applicable sales charge, purchases of Units in the Fund will be                 
aggregated with concurrent purchases by the same person from such               
Underwriter or dealer of units in any series of tax-exempt unit                 
investment trusts sponsored by Nike Securities L.P. Additionally,               
Units purchased in the name of the spouse of a purchaser or in                  
the name of a child of such purchaser will be deemed, for the                   
purpose of calculating the applicable sales charge, to be additional            
purchases by the purchaser. The reduced sales charges will also                 
be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing securities             
for a single trust estate or single fiduciary account.                          

On the Date of Deposit, the Public Offering Price is as indicated               
in the "Summary of Essential Information" for each Trust. In addition           
to fluctuations in the amount of interest accrued but unpaid on                 
Bonds in each Trust                                                             

Page 26                                                                         

of the Fund, the Public Offering Price at any time during the                   
initial offering period will vary from the Public Offering Price                
stated herein in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of                  
the underlying Bonds.                                                           

The aggregate price of the Bonds in each Trust is determined by                 
whomever from time to time is acting as evaluator (the "Evaluator"),            
on the basis of bid prices or offering prices as is appropriate,                
(1) on the basis of current market prices for the Bonds obtained                
from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable                
to those held by the Trust; (2) if such prices are not available                
for any of the Bonds, on the basis of current market prices for                 
comparable bonds; (3) by determining the value of the Bonds by                  
appraisal; or (4) by any combination of the above. Unless Bonds                 
are in default in payment of principal or interest or, in the                   
Sponsor's opinion, in significant risk of such default, the Evaluator           
will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an Insured            
Trust. On the other hand, the value of insurance obtained by the                
issuer of Bonds in a Trust is reflected and included in the market              
value of such Bonds.                                                            

The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of Bonds which are                
in default in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's             
opinion, in significant risk of such default (the "Defaulted Bonds")            
and which are covered by insurance obtained by an Insured Trust,                
the value of the insurance guaranteeing interest and principal                  
payments. The value of the insurance will be equal to the difference            
between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise           
of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance                  
premium attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and                
(ii) the market value of such Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent          
Insurance. In addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability                 
of Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity to meet its commitments            
under the Insured Trust's insurance policy, including the commitments           
to issue Permanent Insurance. It is the position of the Sponsor                 
that this is a fair method of valuing the Bonds and the insurance               
obtained by an Insured Trust and reflects a proper valuation method             
in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Company Act                 
of 1940.                                                                        

No value has been attributed to insurance obtained by an Insured                
Trust as of the date of this Prospectus. However, the Evaluator                 
is attributing value to insurance for the purpose of computing                  
the price or redemption value of Units for certain previous series              
of The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds.                                  

During the initial public offering period, a determination of                   
the aggregate price of the Bonds in a Trust is made by the Evaluator            
on an offering price basis, as of the close of trading on the                   
New York Stock Exchange on each day on which it is open, effective              
for all sales made subsequent to the last preceding determination.              
For purposes of such determinations, the close of trading on the                
New York Stock Exchange is 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. For secondary                
market purposes, the Evaluator will be requested to make such                   
a determination, on a bid price basis, as of the close of trading               
on the New York Stock Exchange on each day on which it is open,                 
effective for all sales, purchases or redemptions made subsequent               
to the last preceding determination.                                            

The Public Offering Price of the Units during the initial offering              
period is equal to the offering price per Unit of the Bonds in                  
a Trust plus the applicable sales charge. After the completion                  
of the initial offering period, the secondary market Public Offering            
Price will be equal to the bid price per Unit of the Bonds in                   
the Trust plus the applicable sales charge. The offering price                  
of Bonds in the Trust may be expected to be greater than the bid                
price of such Bonds by approximately 1-2% of the aggregate principal            
amount of such Bonds.                                                           

Although payment is normally made five business days following                  
the order for purchase, payment may be made prior thereto. Cash,                
if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to the date of settlement           
for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's business                 
and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the                
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Delivery of                 
Certificates representing Units so ordered will be made five business           
days following such order or shortly thereafter. See "Rights of                 
Unit Holders-How May Units Be Redeemed?" for information regarding              
the ability to redeem Units ordered for purchase.                               

How are Units Distributed?                                                      

Until the primary distribution of the Units offered by this Prospectus          
is completed, Units will be offered to the public at the Public                 
Offering Price, computed as described above, by the Underwriters,               
including the Sponsor (see "Underwriting") and through dealers                  
and others. Upon completion of the initial offering, Units repurchased          

Page 27                                                                         

in the secondary market (see "Will There be a Secondary Market?")               
may be offered by this Prospectus at the secondary market public                
offering price determined in the manner described above.                        

It is the intention of the Sponsor to qualify Units of the Fund                 
for sale in a number of states. Sales initially will be made to                 
dealers and others at prices which represent a concession or agency             
commission of $32 per Unit for a National Trust, California Trust               
or a Kansas Trust, $33 per Unit for other State Trusts, $30 per                 
Unit for a Long Intermediate Trust, and, for secondary market                   
sales, 4.0% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for each State                
or National Trust. However, resales of Units of a Trust by such                 
dealers and others to the public will be made at the Public Offering            
Price described in the Prospectus. The Sponsor reserves the right               
to change the amount of the concession or agency commission from                
time to time. Certain commercial banks are making Units of the                  
Fund available to their customers on an agency basis. A portion                 
of the sales charge paid by these customers is retained by or                   
remitted to the banks in the amounts indicated in the fourth preceding          
sentence. Under the Glass-Steagall Act, banks are prohibited from               
underwriting Fund Units; however, the Glass-Steagall Act does                   
permit certain agency transactions and the banking regulators                   
have not indicated that these particular agency transactions are                
not permitted under such Act. In Texas and in certain other states,             
any banks making Units available must be registered as broker/dealers           
under state law. Any broker/dealer or bank will receive additional              
concessions for purchases made from the Sponsor on the Date of                  
Deposit resulting in total concessions as contained in the following            
table:

(1)     The applicable concession will be allotted to broker/dealers            
or banks who purchase Units from the Sponsor only on the Date                   
of Deposit of a given Trust.                                                    

What are the Sponsor's Profits?                                                 

The Underwriters of each Trust, including the Sponsor, will receive             
a gross sales commission equal to 4.9% of the Public Offering                   
Price of the Units for a National Trust, California Trust or a                  
Kansas Trust (equivalent to 5.152% of the net amount invested),                 
and 5.5% of the Public Offering Price of the Units for other State              
Trusts (equivalent to 5.820% of the net amount invested),  less                 
any reduced sales charge for quantity purchases as described under              
"Public Offering-How is the Public Offering Price Determined?"                  
See "Underwriting" for information regarding the receipt of the                 
excess gross sales commissions by the Sponsor from the other Underwriters       
and additional concessions available to Underwriters, dealers                   
and others. In addition, the Sponsor and the other Underwriters                 
of each Trust may be considered to have realized a profit or the                
Sponsor may be considered to have sustained a loss, as the case                 
may be for each Trust, in the amount of any difference between                  
the cost of the Bonds to each Trust (which is based on the Evaluator's          
determination of the aggregate offering price of the underlying                 
Bonds of such Trust on the Date of Deposit) and the cost of such                
Bonds of such Trust to the Sponsor (including the cost of insurance             
obtained by the Sponsor prior to the Date of Deposit for individual             
Bonds). See "Underwriting" and Note 1 of "Notes to Portfolios."                 
Such profits or losses may be realized or sustained by the Sponsor              
and the other Underwriters with respect to Bonds which were acquired            
by the Sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which it and the                 
other Underwriters were members. During the initial offering period,            
the Underwriters also may realize profits or sustain losses from                
the sale of Units to other Underwriters or as a result of fluctuations          
after the Date of Deposit in the offering prices of the Bonds                   
and hence in the Public Offering Price received by the Underwriters.            

The Sponsor has not participated as sole underwriter or manager                 
or member of underwriting syndicates from which any of the Bonds                
in the Fund were acquired. An underwriter or underwriting syndicate             
purchases                                                                       

Page 28                                                                         

bonds from the issuer on a negotiated or competitive bid basis                  
as principal with the motive of marketing such bonds to investors               
at a profit.                                                                    

In maintaining a market for the Units, the Sponsor will also realize            
profits or sustain losses in the amount of any difference between               
the price at which Units are purchased (based on the bid prices                 
of the Bonds in each Trust) and the price at which Units are resold             
(which price is also based on the bid prices of the Bonds in each               
Trust and includes a sales charge of 5.8% for a State Trust, 5.8%               
for a National or Discount Trust, 4.7% for an Intermediate or                   
Long Intermediate Trust and 3.7% for a Short Intermediate Trust)                
or redeemed. The secondary market public offering price of Units                
may be greater or less than the cost of such Units to the Sponsor.              

Will There be a Secondary Market?                                               

After the initial offering period, although it is not obligated                 
to do so, the Sponsor intends to maintain a market for the Units                
and continuously to offer to purchase Units at prices, subject                  
to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of the                
Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust plus interest accrued to                   
the date of settlement. All expenses incurred in maintaining a                  
secondary market, other than the fees of the Evaluator, the other               
expenses of the Trust and the costs of the Trustee in transferring              
and recording the ownership of Units, will be borne by the Sponsor.             
If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for some other business               
reason, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such                  
prices. If a Unit holder wishes to dispose of his Units, he should              
inquire of the Sponsor as to current market prices prior to making              
a tender for redemption to the Trustee. Prospectuses relating                   
to certain other bond funds indicate an intention, subject to                   
change, on the part of the respective sponsors of such funds to                 
repurchase units of those funds on the basis of a price higher                  
than the bid prices of the securities in the funds. Consequently,               
depending upon the prices actually paid, the repurchase price                   
of other sponsors for units of their funds may be computed on                   
a somewhat more favorable basis than the repurchase price offered               
by the Sponsor for Units of a Trust in secondary market transactions.           
As in this Fund, the purchase price per unit of such bond funds                 
will depend primarily on the value of the securities in the portfolio           
of the fund.                                                                    

RIGHTS OF UNIT HOLDERS 

How are Certificates Issued and Transferred?                                    

The Trustee is authorized to treat as the record owner of Units                 
that person who is registered as such owner on the books of the                 
Trustee. Ownership of Units is evidenced by registered certificates             
executed by the Trustee and the Sponsor. Delivery of certificates               
representing Units ordered for purchase is normally made five                   
business days following such order or shortly thereafter. Certificates          
are transferable by presentation and surrender to the Trustee                   
properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments         
of transfer. Certificates to be redeemed must be properly endorsed              
or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer.              
A Unit holder must sign exactly as his name appears on the face                 
of the certificate with signature guaranteed by a participant                   
in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP")                   
or such other signature guaranty program in addition to, or in                  
substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the Trustee. In                  
certain instances the Trustee may require additional documents                  
such as, but not limited to, trust instruments, certificates of                 
death, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates                
of corporate authority. Record ownership may occur before settlement.           

Certificates will be issued in fully registered form, transferable              
only on the books of the Trustee in denominations of one Unit                   
or any multiple thereof, numbered serially for purposes of identification.      

Although no such charge is now made or contemplated, a Unit holder              
may be required to pay $2.00 to the Trustee per certificate reissued            
or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may be                   
imposed in connection with each such transfer or exchange. For                  
new certificates issued to replace destroyed, stolen or lost certificates,      
the Unit holder may be required to furnish indemnity satisfactory               
to the Trustee and pay such expenses as the Trustee may incur.                  
Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for                   
replacement.                                                                    

Page 29                                                                         

How are Interest and Principal Distributed?                                     

Interest from each Trust after deduction of amounts sufficient                  
to reimburse the Trustee, without interest, for any amounts advanced            
and paid to Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity or to the                 
Sponsor as the Unit holder of record as of the First Settlement                 
Date will be distributed on or shortly after the last day of each               
month on a pro rata basis to Unit holders of record as of the                   
preceding Record Date. All distributions for a Trust will be net                
of applicable expenses for such Trust.                                          

The pro rata share of cash in the Principal Account of each Trust               
will be computed as of the fifteenth day of each month, and distributions       
to the Unit holders of such Trust as of such Record Date will                   
be made on or shortly after the last day of each month. Proceeds                
from the disposition of any of the Bonds of such Trust (less any                
premiums due with respect to Bonds for which the Trustee has exercised          
the right to obtain Permanent Insurance) received after such Record             
Date and prior to the following Distribution Date will be held                  
in the Principal Account of such Trust and not distributed until                
the next Distribution Date. The Trustee is not required to make                 
a distribution from the Principal Account of a Trust unless the                 
amount available for distribution shall equal at least $1.00 per                
Unit.                                                                           

The Trustee will credit to the Interest Account of each Trust                   
all interest received by such Trust, including that part of the                 
proceeds (including insurance proceeds if any, paid to an Insured               
Trust) of any disposition of Bonds which represents accrued interest.           
Other receipts will be credited to the Principal Account of such                
Trust. The distribution to the Unit holders of a Trust as of each               
Record Date will be made on the following Distribution Date or                  
shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially                 
equal to such portion of the holder's pro rata share of the estimated           
annual income of such Trust after deducting estimated expenses.                 
Except through an advancement of its own funds, the Trustee has                 
no cash for distribution to Unit holders until it receives interest             
payments on the Bonds in a Trust. The Trustee shall be reimbursed,              
without interest, for any advances from funds in the Interest                   
Account of such Trust on the ensuing Record Date. Persons who                   
purchase Units between a Record Date and a Distribution Date will               
receive their first distribution on the second Distribution Date                
after the purchase. The Trustee is not required to pay interest                 
on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account of a Trust                   
(but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefit from                
the use of such funds).                                                         

As of the fifteenth day of each month, the Trustee will deduct                  
from the Interest Account of each Trust and, to the extent funds                
are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account of each                  
Trust, amounts necessary to pay the expenses of such Trust. The                 
Trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if                   
any, as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental          
charges payable out of the Trust. Amounts so withdrawn shall not                
be considered a part of the Trust's assets until such time as                   
the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the                 
appropriate account. In addition, the Trustee may withdraw from                 
the Interest Account and the Principal Account of a Trust such                  
amounts as may be necessary to cover redemption of Units of such                
Trust by the Trustee.                                                           

How Can Distributions to Unit Holders be Reinvested?                            

Universal Distribution Option. Unit holders may elect participation             
in a Universal Distribution Option which permits a Unit holder                  
to direct the Trustee to distribute principal and interest payments             
to any other investment vehicle of which the Unit holder has an                 
existing account. For example, at a Unit holder's direction, the                
Trustee would distribute automatically on the applicable distribution           
date interest income, capital gains or principal on the participant's           
Units to, among other investment vehicles, a Unit holder's checking,            
bank savings, money market, insurance, reinvestment or any other                
account. All such distributions, of course, are subject to the                  
minimum investment and sales charges, if any, of the particular                 
investment vehicle to which distributions are directed. The Trustee             
will notify the participant of each distribution pursuant to the                
Universal Distribution Option. The Trustee will distribute directly             
to the Unit holder any distributions which are not accepted by                  
the specified investment vehicle. A participant may at any time,                
by so notifying the Trustee in writing, elect to terminate his                  
participation in the Universal Distribution Option and receive                  
directly future distributions on his Units.                                     

Page 30                                                                         

Distribution Reinvestment Option. The Sponsor has entered into                  
an arrangement with Oppenheimer Management Corporation which permits            
any Unit holder of a Trust to elect to have each distribution                   
of interest income or principal, including capital gains, on his                
Units automatically reinvested in shares of either the Oppenheimer              
Intermediate Tax-Exempt Bond Fund (the "Intermediate Series")                   
or the Oppenheimer Insured Tax-Exempt Bond Fund (the "Insured                   
Series"). Oppenheimer Management Corporation is the investment                  
adviser of each Series which are open-end, diversified management               
companies. The investment objective of the Intermediate Series                  
is to provide a high level of current interest income exempt from               
Federal income tax through the purchase of investment grade securities.         
The investment objective of the Insured Series is to provide as                 
high a level of current interest income exempt from Federal income              
tax as is consistent with the assurance of the scheduled receipt                
of interest and principal through insurance and the preservation                
of capital (the income of either Series may constitute an item                  
of preference for determining the Federal alternative minimum                   
tax). The objectives and policies of each Series are presented                  
in more detail in the prospectus for each Series.                               

Each person who purchases Units of a Series may use the card attached           
to this prospectus to request a prospectus describing each Series               
and a form by which such person may elect to become a participant               
in a Distribution Reinvestment Option with respect to a Series.                 
Each distribution of interest income or principal, including capital            
gains, on the participant's Units will automatically be applied                 
by the Trustee to purchase shares (or fractions thereof) of a                   
Series without a sales charge and with no minimum investment requirements.      

The shareholder service agent for each Series will mail to each                 
participant in the Distribution Reinvestment Option confirmations               
of all transactions undertaken for such participant in connection               
with the receipt of distributions from The First Trust Combined                 
Series and the purchase of shares (or fractions thereof) of a                   
Series.                                                                         

A participant may at any time, by so notifying the Trustee in                   
writing, elect to terminate his participation in the Distribution               
Reinvestment Option and receive future distributions on his Units               
in cash. There will be no charge or other penalty for such termination.         
The Sponsor and Oppenheimer Management Corporation each have the                
right to terminate the Distribution Reinvestment Option, in whole               
or in part.                                                                     

It should be remembered that even if distributions are reinvested               
through the Universal Distribution Option or the Distribution                   
Reinvestment Option they are still treated as distributions for                 
income tax purposes.                                                            

What Reports will Unit Holders Receive?                                         

The Trustee shall furnish Unit holders of each Trust in connection              
with each distribution a statement of the amount of interest,                   
if any, and the amount of other receipts, if any, which are being               
distributed, expressed in each case as a dollar amount per Unit.                
Within a reasonable time after the last business day of each calendar           
year, the Trustee will furnish to each person who at any time                   
during the calendar year was a Unit holder of a Trust of record,                
a statement as to (1) the Interest Account: interest received                   
by such Trust (including amounts representing interest received                 
upon any disposition of Bonds of such Trust), the amount of such                
interest representing insurance proceeds (if applicable), deductions            
for payment of applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of the                
Trust, redemption of Units and the balance remaining after such                 
distributions and deductions, expressed both as a total dollar                  
amount and as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share                   
of each Unit outstanding on the last business day of such calendar              
year; (2) the Principal Account: the dates of disposition of any                
Bonds of such Trust and the net proceeds received therefrom (excluding          
any portion representing interest and the premium attributable                  
to the exercise of the right, if applicable, to obtain Permanent                
Insurance), deduction for payment of applicable taxes and for                   
fees and expenses of the Trust, redemptions of Units, and the                   
balance remaining after such distributions and deductions, expressed            
both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount representing               
the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding on the last business                
day of such calendar year; (3) the Bonds held and the number of                 
Units of such Trust outstanding on the last business day of such                
calendar year; (4) the Redemption Price per Unit based upon the                 
last computation thereof made during such calendar year; and (5)                
the amounts actually distributed during such calendar year from                 
the Interest Account and from the Principal Account of such Trust,              

Page 31                                                                         

separately stated, expressed both as total dollar amounts and                   
as dollar amounts per Unit outstanding on the Record Date for                   
such distributions.                                                             

In order to comply with Federal and state tax reporting requirements,           
Unit holders will be furnished, upon request to the Trustee, evaluations        
of the Bonds in their Trust furnished to it by the Evaluator.                   

How May Units be Redeemed?                                                      

A Unit holder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by tender                
to the Trustee at its unit investment trust office in the City                  
of New York of the certificates representing the Units to be redeemed,          
duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer                  
with signature guaranteed as explained above (or by providing                   
satisfactory indemnity, as in connection with lost, stolen or                   
destroyed certificates), and payment of applicable governmental                 
charges, if any. No redemption fee will be charged. On the seventh              
calendar day following such tender, or if the seventh calendar                  
day is not a business day, on the first business day prior thereto,             
the Unit holder will be entitled to receive in cash an amount                   
for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed              
after receipt by the Trustee of such tender of Units. The "date                 
of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received                 
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the                 
close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender             
is the next day on which such Exchange is open for trading and                  
such Units will be deemed to have been tendered to the Trustee                  
on such day for redemption at the redemption price computed on                  
that day. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.                                 

Accrued interest to the settlement date paid on redemption shall                
be withdrawn from the Interest Account of the Trust or, if the                  
balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account of                  
such Trust. All other amounts paid on redemption shall be withdrawn             
from the Principal Account of the Trust.                                        

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market                  
Public Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the                   
bid price of the Bonds in the Trust, while the Public Offering                  
Price of Units during the initial offering period will be determined            
on the basis of the offering price of the Bonds of such Trust,                  
as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the                
date any such determination is made. On the Date of Deposit the                 
Public Offering Price per Unit (which is based on the offering                  
prices of the Bonds in the Trust and includes the sales charge)                 
exceeded the Unit value at which Units could have been redeemed                 
(based upon the current bid prices of the Bonds in such Trust)                  
by the amount shown under "Summary of Essential Information" for                
each Trust. The Redemption Price per Unit is the pro rata share                 
of each Unit determined by the Trustee on the basis of (1) the                  
cash on hand in the Trust or moneys in the process of being collected,          
(2) the value of the Bonds in such Trust based on the bid prices                
of the Bonds, except for those cases in which the value of the                  
insurance, if applicable, has been added, and (3) interest accrued              
thereon, less (a) amounts representing taxes or other governmental              
charges payable out of such Trust, (b) the accrued expenses of                  
such Trust, and (c) cash held for distribution to Unit holders                  
of record as of a date prior to the evaluation then being made.                 
The Evaluator may determine the value of the Bonds in the Trust                 
(1) on the basis of current bid prices of the Bonds obtained from               
dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to                  
those held by such Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices for bonds              
comparable to any Bonds for which bid prices are not available,                 
(3) by determining the value of the Bonds by appraisal, or (4)                  
by any combination of the above. In determining the Redemption                  
Price per Unit for an Insured Trust, no value will be attributed                
to the portfolio insurance covering the Bonds in such Trust unless              
such Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest                   
or in significant risk of such default. On the other hand, Bonds                
insured under a policy obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters,           
the Sponsor or others are entitled to the benefits of such insurance            
at all times and such benefits are reflected and included in the                
market value of such Bonds. See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts
Insured?" For a description of the situations in which the evaluator            
may value the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, see "Public
Offering-How is the Public Offering Price Determined?"                          

The difference between the bid and offering prices of such Bonds                
may be expected to average 1-2% of the principal amount. In the                 
case of actively traded bonds, the difference may be as little                  
as  1/2 of 1% and, in the case of inactively traded bonds, such                 
difference usually will not exceed 3%. Therefore, the price at                  
which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid                   
by the Unit holder. At the opening of business on the                           

Page 32                                                                         

Date of Deposit, the aggregate current offering price of such                   
Bonds per Unit exceeded the Redemption Price per Unit (based upon               
current bid prices of such Bonds) by the amount indicated in the                
"Summary of Essential Information."                                             

The Trustee is empowered to sell underlying Bonds in a Trust in                 
order to make funds available for redemption. To the extent that                
Bonds are sold, the size and diversity of such Trust will be reduced.           
Such sales may be required at a time when Bonds would not otherwise             
be sold and might result in lower prices than might otherwise                   
be realized. The Trustee may obtain Permanent Insurance on the                  
Bonds in an Insured Trust. Accordingly, any Bonds so insured may                
be sold on an insured basis (as will Bonds on which insurance                   
has been obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor             
or others).                                                                     

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed                  
for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed,              
other than for customary weekend and holiday closings, or during                
which the Securities and Exchange Commission determines that trading            
on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result              
of which disposal or evaluation of the Bonds is not reasonably                  
practicable, or for such other periods as the Securities and Exchange           
Commission may by order permit. Under certain extreme circumstances,            
the Sponsor may apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission                 
for an order permitting a full or partial suspension of the right               
of Unit holders to redeem their Units.                                          

How May Units be Purchased by the Sponsor?                                      

The Trustee shall notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for                 
redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the secondary market at that                
time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit, it may purchase           
such Units by notifying the Trustee before 12:00 p.m. Eastern                   
time on the next succeeding business day and by making payment                  
therefor to the Unit holder not later than the day on which the                 
Units would otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee. Units                  
held by the Sponsor may be tendered to the Trustee for redemption               
as any other Units.                                                             

The offering price of any Units acquired by the Sponsor will be                 
in accord with the Public Offering Price described in the then                  
currently effective prospectus describing such Units. Any profit                
or loss resulting from the resale or redemption of such Units                   
will belong to the Sponsor.                                                     

How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?                                         

The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming                  
Units tendered by any Unit holder and for the payment of expenses               
for which funds may not be available, such of the Bonds in each                 
Trust on a list furnished by the Sponsor as the Trustee in its                  
sole discretion may deem necessary. As described in the following               
paragraph and in certain other unusual circumstances for which                  
it is determined by the Depositor to be in the best interests                   
of the Unit holders or if there is no alternative, the Trustee                  
is empowered to sell Bonds in a Trust which are in default in                   
payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such                 
default and for which value has been attributed to the insurance,               
if any, obtained by the Trust. See "How May Units be Redeemed?"                 
The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee              
to dispose of Bonds in a Trust in the event of advanced refunding.              
The Sponsor may from time to time act as agent for a Trust with                 
respect to selling Bonds out of a Trust. From time to time, the                 
Trustee may retain and pay compensation to the Sponsor subject                  
to the restrictions under the Investment Company Act of 1940,                   
as amended.                                                                     

If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any                   
Bond occurs and no provision for payment is made therefor, either               
pursuant to the portfolio insurance, if any, or otherwise, within               
thirty days, the Trustee is required to notify the Sponsor thereof.             
If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold                 
such Bond within thirty days after notification by the Trustee                  
to the Sponsor of such default, the Trustee may, in its discretion,             
sell the defaulted Bond and not be liable for any depreciation                  
or loss thereby incurred.                                                       

The Sponsor shall instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made                 
by an issuer of any of the Bonds to issue new obligations in exchange           
and substitution for any Bonds pursuant to a refunding or refinancing           
plan, except that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept                
such an offer or to take any other action with respect thereto                  
as the Sponsor may deem proper if the issuer is in default with                 
respect to such Bonds or in the written opinion of the Sponsor                  
the issuer will probably default in respect to such Bonds in the                
foreseeable future. Any obligations so received in exchange or                  
substitution will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms                   

Page 33                                                                         

and conditions in the Indenture to the same extent as Bonds originally          
deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of obligations         
in exchange or substitution for underlying Bonds, the Trustee                   
is required to give notice thereof to each Unit holder of the                   
affected Trust, identifying the Bonds eliminated and the Bonds                  
substituted therefor. Except as stated in this paragraph and under              
"What is the First Trust Combined Series?" for Failed Bonds, the                
acquisition by a Trust of any securities other than the Bonds                   
initially deposited is prohibited.

to the Sponsor and not to the Trust or to any series thereof or                 
to any other Underwriter. The information is included herein only               
for the purpose of informing investors as to the financial responsibility       
of the Sponsor and its ability to carry out its contractual obligations.        
More detailed financial information will be made available by

Who is the Trustee?                                                             

The Trustee is United States Trust Company of New York with its                 
principal place of business at 45 Wall Street, New York, New York
10005 and its unit investment trust offices at 770 Broadway, New
York, New York 10003. Unit holders who have questions regarding                 
the Fund may call the Customer Service Help Line at 1-800-682-7520.             
The Trustee is a member of the New York Clearing House Association              
and is subject to supervision and examination by the Comptroller                
of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and                  
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.                           

The Trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated       
in the selection of the Securities. For information relating to                 
the responsibilities of the Trustee under the Indenture, reference              
is made to the material set forth under "Rights of Unit Holders."               

The Trustee and any successor trustee may resign by executing                   
an instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor                   
and mailing a copy of a notice of resignation to all Unit holders.              
Upon receipt of such notice, the Sponsor is obligated to appoint                
a successor trustee promptly. If the Trustee becomes incapable                  
of acting or becomes bankrupt or its affairs are taken over by                  
public authorities, the Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint              
a successor as provided in the Indenture. If upon resignation                   
of a trustee no successor has accepted the appointment within                   
30 days after notification, the retiring trustee may apply to                   
a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.           
The resignation or removal of a trustee becomes effective only                  
when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or                   
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee.            

Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which                
it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any                   
merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall be a party, shall              
be the successor Trustee. The Trustee must be a banking corporation             
organized under the laws of the United States or any State and                  
having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided                 
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

Page 34                                                                         

Limitations on Liabilities of Sponsor and Trustee                               

The Sponsor and the Trustee shall be under no liability to Unit                 
holders for taking any action or for refraining from taking any                 
action in good faith pursuant to the Indenture, or for errors                   
in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful misfeasance,        
bad faith, gross negligence (ordinary negligence in the case of                 
the Trustee) or reckless disregard of their obligations and duties.             
The Trustee shall not be liable for depreciation or loss incurred               
by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any of the Bonds. In the                
event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the Indenture,                 
the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any                  
action taken by it in good faith under the Indenture.                           

The Trustee shall not be liable for any taxes or other governmental             
charges imposed upon or in respect of the Bonds or upon the interest            
thereon or upon it as Trustee under the Indenture or upon or in                 
respect of the Fund which the Trustee may be required to pay under              
any present or future law of the United States of America or of                 
any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the                
Indenture contains other customary provisions limiting the liability            
of the Trustee.                                                                 

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the                
Indenture or become incapable of acting or become bankrupt or                   
its affairs are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee              
may (a) appoint a successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed             
by the Trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed            
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or (b) terminate the                 
Indenture and liquidate the Trusts as provided herein, or (c)                   
continue to act as Trustee without terminating the Indenture.                   

Who is the Evaluator?                                                           

The Evaluator is Securities Evaluation Service, Inc., 531 East                  
Roosevelt Road, Suite 200, Wheaton, Illinois 60187. The Evaluator               
may resign or may be removed by the Sponsor and the Trustee, in                 
which event the Sponsor and the Trustee are to use their best                   
efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor. Such resignation                   
or removal shall become effective upon the acceptance of appointment            
by the successor Evaluator. If upon resignation of the Evaluator                
no successor has accepted appointment within thirty days after                  
notice of resignation, the Evaluator may apply to a court of competent          
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.                                

The Trustee, Sponsor and Unit holders may rely on any evaluation                
furnished by the Evaluator and shall have no responsibility for                 
the accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Evaluator under the                 
Indenture shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best                
information available to it, provided, however, that the Evaluator              
shall be under no liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unit holders             
for errors in judgment. This provision shall not protect the Evaluator          
in any case of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence                 
or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties.                            

OTHER INFORMATION               

How May the Indenture be Amended or Terminated?                                 

The Sponsor and the Trustee have the power to amend the Indenture               
without the consent of any of the Unit holders when such an amendment           
is (1) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision          
of the Indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any                
other provision contained therein, or (2) to make such other provisions         
as shall not adversely affect the interest of the Unit holders                  
(as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee),                   
provided that the Indenture is not amended to increase the number               
of Units of any Trust issuable thereunder or to permit the deposit              
or acquisition of securities either in addition to or in substitution           
for any of the Bonds of any Trust initially deposited in a Trust,               
except for the substitution of certain refunding securities for                 
Bonds or New Bonds for Failed Bonds. In the event of any amendment,             
the Trustee is obligated to notify promptly all Unit holders of                 
the substance of such amendment.                                                

Each Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of 100% of                  
the Unit holders of such Trust or by the Trustee when the value                 
of such Trust, as shown by any evaluation, is less than 20% of                  
the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds initially deposited                 
in the Trust or by the Trustee in the event that Units of a Trust               
not yet sold aggregating more than 60% of the Units of such Trust               
are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters, including the                  
Sponsor. If a Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of                  
unsold Units of the Trust by the

Underwriters, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units                
of such Trust the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser.                   
The Indenture will terminate upon the redemption, sale or other                 
disposition of the last Bond held thereunder, but in no event                   
shall it continue beyond December 31, 2043. In the event of termination,        
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to all Unit                  
holders of such Trust. Within a reasonable period after termination,            
the Trustee will sell any Bonds remaining in the Trust and, after               
paying all expenses and charges incurred by such Trust, will distribute         
to each Unit holder of such Trust (including the Sponsor if it                  
then holds any Units), upon surrender for cancellation of his                   
Certificate for Units, his pro rata share of the balances remaining             
in the Interest and Principal Accounts of such Trust, all as provided           
in the Indenture.

On the Date of Deposit, the Underwriters of each Trust became

The Agreement Among Underwriters provides that a public offering                
of the Units of each Trust will be made at the Public Offering

Aggregate Monthly Dollar Amount of UIT Units Sold at Public Offering            
Price is based on settled trades for a month (excluding trades                  
without a sales charge at net asset value and including sales                   
of Units to the Sponsor in the secondary market which are resold),              
net of redemptions.                                                             

In addition to any other benefits that the Underwriters may realize             
from the sale of the Units of a Trust, the Agreement Among Underwriters         
provides that the Sponsor will share with the other Underwriters                
50% of the net gain, if any, represented by the difference between              
the Sponsor's cost of the Bonds in connection with their acquisition            
(including the cost of insurance obtained by the Sponsor prior                  
to the Date of Deposit for individual Bonds) and the Aggregate                  
Offering Price thereof on the Date of Deposit, less a charge for                
acquiring the Bonds in the portfolio and for the Sponsor maintaining            
a secondary market for the Units. Furthermore, any underwriter                  
that sells a total of 1,000 Units or more of any National Trust                 
will receive an additional $2.00 per Unit sold. However, such                   
sales will not qualify for the Aggregate Monthly Sales Program.                 
See "What are the Sponsor's Profits?" and Note 1 of "Notes to
Portfolios." McLaughlin, Piven, Vogel Securities, Inc. ("MPV")                  
and Nike Securities L.P. entered into an agreement under which                  
MPV will receive from Nike Securities L.P. reimbursement for certain            
costs and further compensation, in addition to that described                   
above, based on the number of Units it underwrites or otherwise                 
sells and on the total Units of Nike Securities L.P. products                   
sold.                                                                           

From time to time the Sponsor may implement programs under which                
Underwriters and dealers of the Fund may receive nominal awards                 
from the Sponsor for each of their registered representatives                   
who have sold a minimum number of UIT Units during a specified                  
time period. In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement            
other programs under which the sales force of an Underwriter or                 
dealer may be eligible to                                                       

Page 37                                                                         

win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts, or under which              
the Sponsor will reallow to any such Underwriter or dealer that                 
sponsors sales contests or recognition programs conforming to                   
criteria established by the Sponsor, or participates in sales                   
programs sponsored by the Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the                  
total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such                   
person at the public offering price during such programs. Also,                 
the Sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to                 
objective criteria established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying            
Underwriters or dealers for certain services or activities which                
are primarily intended to result in sales of Units of the Trusts.               
Such payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and                
not out of the assets of the Trusts. These programs will not change             
the price Unit holders pay for their Units or the amount that                   
the Trusts will receive from the Units sold.                                    

A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current               
returns and estimated long-term returns with the returns on various             
taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment          
decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its advertising                  
and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns                  
on the Trust and returns over specified periods on other similar                
Trusts sponsored by Nike Securities L.P. with returns on taxable                
investments such as corporate or U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs                
and money market accounts or money market funds, each of which                  
has investment characteristics that may differ from those of the                
Trust. U.S. Government bonds, for example, are backed by the full               
faith and credit of the U.S. Government and bank CDs and money                  
market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal government.             
Money market accounts and money market funds provide stability                  
of principal, but pay interest at rates that vary with the condition            
of the short-term debt market. The investment characteristics                   
of the Trust are described more fully elsewhere in this Prospectus.

(1)     The Estimated Current Return is calculated by dividing the              
Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public Offering            
Price. The Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit will                   
vary with changes in fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Portfolio            
Supervisor and the Evaluator and with the principal prepayment,                 
redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of Bonds while the Public                
Offering Price will vary with changes in the offering price of                  
the underlying Bonds; therefore, there is no assurance that the                 
present Estimated Current Return indicated above will be realized               
in the future. The Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using               
a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and                
factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields                 
(which take into account the amortization of premiums and the                   
accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of all of the                 
Bonds in the Trust; (2) takes into account the expenses and sales               
charge associated with each Unit of the Trust; and (3) takes into               
effect the tax-adjusted yield from potential capital gains at                   
the Date of Deposit. Since the market values and estimated retirements          
of the Bonds and the expenses of the Trust will change, there                   
is no assurance that the present Estimated Long-Term Return indicated           
above will be realized in the future. Estimated Current Return                  
and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ because                   
the calculation of the Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the                  
estimated date and amount of principal returned while the Estimated             
Current Return calculations include only Net Annual Interest Income             
and Public Offering Price. Neither rate reflects the true return                
to Unit holders, which is lower, because neither includes the                   
effect of certain delays in distributions to Unit holders. The                  
above figures are based on estimated per Unit cash flows. Estimated             
cash flows will vary with changes in fees and expenses, with changes            
in current interest rates, and with the principal prepayment,                   
redemption, maturity, call, exchange or sale of the underlying                  
Bonds. The estimated cash flows for this Trust are set forth under              
"Estimated Cash Flows to Unit Holders."

California Insured Trust Summary                                                

The California Insured Trust consists of seven obligations of                   
issuers located in California. The Bond issues in the Trust are                 
either general obligations of governmental entities or are revenue              
bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority.               
The Bonds in the Trust are divided by purpose of issue and represent            
the percentage of aggregate principal amount of the Bonds as indicated          
by the following table:                                                         

                                                                [Download Table]

3               Miscellaneous                   48.25%    


Each of six Bond issues represents 10% or more of the aggregate                 
principal amount of the Bonds in the Trust or a total of approximately          
98%. The five largest such issues represent approximately 17 %                  
each. None of the Bonds in the Trust are subject to call within                 
five years of the Date of Deposit, although certain Bonds may                   
be subject to an extraordinary call.                                            

Approximately 17% of the aggregate principal amount (approximately              
17% of the aggregate offering price) of the Bonds in the Trust                  
were purchased at a premium over par value. Certain of these Bonds              
are subject to redemption pursuant to call provisions in approximately          
9 years after the Date of Deposit. See "What Is the First Trust
Combined Series?", "California Insured Trust, Series 8-Portfolio"               
and "Description of Bond Ratings."                                              

Federal and California State Tax-Free Income                                    

The following table shows the approximate marginal taxable yields               
for individuals that are equivalent to tax-exempt yields under                  
combined Federal and state taxes, using published Federal tax                   
rates and state tax rates scheduled to be in effect in 1994. The                
table incorporates increased tax rates for higher-income taxpayers              
that were included in the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993.                   
For cases in which more than one state bracket falls within a                   
Federal bracket, the higher state bracket is combined with the                  
Federal bracket. The combined state and Federal tax rates shown                 
reflect the fact that state tax payments are currently deductible               
for Federal tax purposes. The table illustrates what you would                  
have to earn on taxable investments to equal the tax-exempt yield               
for your income tax bracket. The taxable equivalent yields may                  
be somewhat higher than the equivalent yields indicated in the                  
following table for those individuals who have adjusted gross                   
incomes in excess of $111,800. The table does not reflect the                   
effect of the limitations on itemized deductions and the deduction              
for personal exemptions. They were designed to phase out certain                
benefits of these deductions for higher income taxpayers. These                 
limitations, in effect, raise the maximum marginal Federal tax                  
rate to approximately 44% for taxpayers filing a joint return                   
and entitled to four personal exemptions and to approximately                   
41% for taxpayers filing a single return entitled to only one                   
personal exemption. These limitations are subject to certain maximums,          
which depend on the number of exemptions claimed and the total                  
amount of the taxpayer's itemized deductions. For example, the                  
limitation on itemized deductions will not cause a taxpayer to                  
lose more than 80% of his allowable itemized deductions, with                   
certain exceptions.

does not reflect the limitation on itemized deductions and the                  
phase out of the benefit of the personal exemption credit and                   
the dependant exemption credit that are imposed by the California               
income tax laws in a manner similar to Federal tax law.                         

Certain Considerations                                                          

Economic Factors. The California Trust is susceptible to political,             
economic or regulatory factors affecting issuers of California                  
municipal obligations (the "California Municipal Obligations").                 
These include the possible adverse effects of certain California                
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives              
and other matters that are described below. The following information           
provides only a brief summary of the complex factors affecting                  
the financial situation in California (the "State") and is derived              
from sources that are generally available to investors and are                  
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been                   
made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the following information.       
It is based in part on information obtained from various State                  
and local agencies in California or contained in Official Statements            
for various California Municipal Obligations.                                   

There can be no assurance that future statewide or regional economic            
difficulties, and the resulting impact on State or local governmental           
finances generally, will not adversely affect the market value                  
of California Municipal Obligations held in the portfolio of the                
Trust or the ability of particular obligors to make timely payments             
of debt service on (or relating to) those obligations.                          

Economic Overview. California's economy is the largest among the                
50 states and one of the largest in the world. The State's population           
of almost 32 million represents 12.3% of the total United States                
population and grew by 27% in the 1980s. Total personal income                  
in the State, at an estimated $640 billion in 1992, accounts for                
13% of all personal income in the nation. Total employment is                   
almost 14 million, the majority of which is in the service, trade               
and manufacturing sectors.                                                      

Reports issued by the State Department of Finance and the Commission            
on State Finance (the "COSF") indicate that the State's economy                 
is suffering its worst recession since the 1930s, with prospects                
for recovery slower than for the nation as a whole. The State                   
has experienced the worst job losses in any postwar recession                   
and employment levels are not expected to stabilize until late                  
1994 or 1995. Pre-recession job levels may not be reached until                 
near the end of the decade. The largest job losses have been in                 
Southern California, led by declines in the aerospace and construction          
industries. Weakness statewide occurred in manufacturing, construction,         
services and trade. Additional military base closures will have                 
further adverse effects on the State's economy later in the decade.             
Unemployment averaged over 9% in 1993 and is expected to remain                 
high in 1994. The State's economy is only expected to pull out                  
of the recession slowly, once the national recovery has begun.                  
Delay in recovery will exacerbate shortfalls in State revenues.                 

Constitutional Limitations on Taxes and Appropriations                          

Limitation on Taxes. Certain California municipal obligations                   
may be obligations of issuers which rely in whole or in part,                   
directly or indirectly, on ad valorem property taxes as a source                
of revenue. The taxing powers of California local governments                   
and districts are limited by Article XIIIA of the California Constitution,      
enacted                                                                         

Page 41                                                                         

by the voters in 1978 and commonly known as "Proposition 13."                   
Briefly, Article XIIIA limits to 1% of full cash value the rate                 
of ad valorem property taxes on real property and generally restricts           
the reassessment of property to 2% per year, except upon new construction       
or change of ownership (subject to a number of exemptions). Taxing              
entities may, however, raise ad valorem taxes above the 1% limit                
to pay debt service on voter-approved bonded indebtedness.                      

Under Article XIIIA, the basic 1% ad valorem tax levy is applied                
against the assessed value of property as of the owner's date                   
of acquisition (or as of March 1, 1975, if acquired earlier),                   
subject to certain adjustments. This system has resulted in widely              
varying amounts of tax on similarly situated properties. Several                
lawsuits have been filed challenging the acquisition-based assessment           
system of Proposition 13 and on June 18, 1992 the U.S. Supreme                  
Court announced a decision upholding Proposition 13.                            

Article XIIIA prohibits local governments from raising revenues                 
through ad valorem property taxes above the 1% limit; it also                   
requires voters of any governmental unit to give two-thirds approval            
to levy any "special tax." Court decisions, however, allowed non-voter          
approved levy of "general taxes" which were not dedicated to a                  
specific use. In response to these decisions, the voters of the                 
State in 1986 adopted an initiative statute which imposed significant           
new limits on the ability of local entities to raise or levy general            
taxes,except by receiving majority local voter approval. Significant            
elements of this initiative, "Proposition 62," have been overturned             
in recent court cases. An initiative proposed to re-enact the                   
provisions of Proposition 62 as a constitutional amendment was                  
defeated by the voters in November 1990, but such a proposal may                
be renewed in the future.                                                       

Appropriations Limits. California and its local governments are                 
subject to an annual "appropriations limit" imposed by Article                  
XIIIB of the California Constitution, enacted by the voters in                  
1979 and significantly amended by Propositions 98 and 111 in 1988               
and 1990, respectively. Article XIIIB prohibits the State or any                
covered local government from spending "appropriations subject                  
to limitation" in excess of the appropriations limit imposed.                   
"Appropriations subject to limitation" are authorizations to spend              
"proceeds of taxes," which consist of tax revenues, and certain                 
other funds, including proceeds from regulatory licenses, user                  
charges or other fees, to the extent that such proceeds exceed                  
the cost of providing the product or service, but "proceeds of                  
taxes" exclude most State subventions to local governments. No                  
limit is imposed on appropriations of funds which are not "proceeds             
of taxes," such as reasonable user charges or fees, and certain                 
other non-tax funds, including bond proceeds.                                   

Among the expenditures not included in the Article XIIIB appropriations         
limit are (1) the debt service cost of bonds issued or authorized               
prior to January 1, 1979, or subsequently authorized by the voters,             
(2) appropriations arising from certain emergencies declared by                 
the Governor, (3) appropriations for certain capital outlay projects,           
(4) appropriations by the State of post-1989 increases in gasoline              
taxes and vehicle weight fees, and (5) appropriations made in                   
certain cases of emergency.                                                     

The appropriations limit for each year is adjusted annually to                  
reflect changes in cost of living and population, and any transfers             
of service responsibilities between government units. The definitions           
for such adjustments were liberalized in 1990 to follow more closely            
growth in California's economy.                                                 

"Excess" revenues are measured over a two-year cycle. Local governments         
must return any excess to taxpayers by rate reduction. The State                
must refund 50% of any excess, with the other 50% paid to schools               
and community colleges. With more liberal annual adjustment factors             
since 1988, and depressed revenues since 1990 because of the recession,         
few governments are currently operating near their spending limits,             
but this condition may change over time. Local governments may                  
by voter approval exceed their spending limits for up to four                   
years.                                                                          

Because of the complex nature of Articles XIIIA and XIIIB of the                
California Constitution, the ambiguities and possible inconsistencies           
in their terms, and the impossibility of predicting future appropriations       
or changes in population and cost of living, and the probability                
of continuing legal challenges, it is not currently possible to                 
determine fully the impact of Article XIIIA or Article XIIIB on                 
California Municipal Obligations or on the ability of California                
or local governments to pay debt service on such California Municipal           
Obligations. It it not presently possible to predict the outcome                
of any pending litigation with respect to the ultimate scope,                   
impact or constitutionality of either Article XIIIA or Article                  
XIIIB, or the impact of any such determinations upon State agencies             
or local governments, or upon their ability to pay debt service                 
on their obligations. Future                                                    

Page 42                                                                         

initiatives or legislative changes in laws or the California Constitution       
may also affect the ability of the State or local issuers to repay              
their obligations.                                                              

Obligations of the State of California. As of January 1, 1994,                  
California had approximately $17.7 billion of general obligation                
bonds outstanding, and $6.3 billion remained authorized but unissued.           
In addition, at June 30, 1993, the State had lease-purchase obligations,        
payable from the State's General Fund, of approximately $4.0 billion.           
In fiscal year 1992-93, debt service on general obligation bonds                
and lease-purchase debt was approximately 4.1% of General Fund                  
revenues. The State has paid the principal of and interest on                   
its general obligations bonds, lease-purchase debt and short-term               
obligations when due.                                                           

Recent Financial Results. The principal sources of General Fund                 
revenues in 1992-1993 were the California personal income tax                   
(44% of total revenues), the sales tax (38%), bank and corporation              
taxes (12%), and the gross premium tax on insurance (3%). California            
maintains a Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties (the "Economic              
Uncertainties Fund"), derived from General Fund revenues, as a                  
reserve to meet cash needs of the General Fund.                                 

General. Throughout the 1980's, State spending increased rapidly                
as the State population and economy also grew rapidly, including                
increased spending for many assistance programs to local governments,           
which were constrained by Proposition 13 and other laws. The largest            
State program is assistance to local public school districts.                   
In 1988, an initiative (Proposition 98) was enacted which (subject              
to suspension by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature and the                   
Governor) guarantees local school districts and community college               
districts a minimum share of State General Fund revenues (generally             
about 33%).                                                                     

Since the start of 1990-91 Fiscal Year, the State has faced adverse             
economic, fiscal, and budget conditions. The economic recession                 
seriously affected State tax revenues. It also caused increased                 
expenditures for health and welfare programs. The State is also                 
facing a structural imbalance in its budget with the largest programs           
supported by the General Fund (education, health, welfare and                   
corrections) growing at rates higher than the growth rates for                  
the principal revenue sources of the General Fund. As a result,                 
the State entered a period of budget imbalance, with expenditures               
exceeding revenues for four of the five fiscal years ending in                  
1991-92; revenues and expenditures were about equal in 1992-93.                 
By June 30, 1993, the State's General Fund had an accumulated                   
deficit, on a budget basis, of approximately $2.2 billion.                      

As a consequence of the large budget imbalances built up over                   
the past three years, the State depleted its available cash resources.          
The State has had to rely increasingly on a series of external                  
borrowings to meet its cash flow requirements.                                  

1992-93 Fiscal Year. At the outset of the 1992-93 Fiscal Year,                  
the State estimated that approximately $7.9 billion of budget                   
actions would be required to end the fiscal year without a budget               
deficit. The difficulty of taking these actions delayed enactment               
of a budget for more than two months past the start of the 1992-93              
Fiscal Year. With the failure to enact a budget by July 1, 1992,                
the State had no legal authority to pay many of its vendors until               
the budget was passed; nevertheless, certain obligations (such                  
as debt service, school apportionments, welfare payments, and                   
employee salaries) were payable because of continuing or special                
appropriations, or court orders. However, the State Controller                  
did not have enough cash to pay as they came due all of these                   
ongoing obligations, as well as valid obligations incurred in                   
the prior fiscal year.                                                          

Because of the delay in enacting the budget, the State could not                
carry out its normal cash flow borrowing and, starting on July
1, 1992, the Controller was required to issue "registered warrants"             
in lieu of normal warrants backed by cash to pay many State obligations.        
Available cash was used to pay constitutionally mandated and priority           
obligations. Between July 1 and September 3, 1992, the Controller               
issued an aggregate of approximately $3.8 billion of registered                 
warrants, all of which were called for redemption by September
4, 1992 following enactment of the 1992-93 Budget Act and issuance              
by the State of $3.3 billion of Interim Notes.                                  

The 1992-93 Budget Bill was signed on September 2, 1992. The 1992-93            
Budget Act provides for expenditures of $57.4 billion and consists              
of General Fund expenditures of $40.8 billion and Special Fund                  
and Bond Fund expenditures of $16.6 billion. The Department of                  
Finance estimated there would be a balance in the Special Fund                  
for Economic Uncertainties of $28 million on June 30, 1993.                     

Page 43                                                                         

The $7.9 billion budget gap was closed through a combination of                 
increased revenues and transfers and expenditure cuts. The principle            
reductions were in health and welfare, K-12 schools and community               
colleges, State aid to local governments, higher education (partially           
offset by increased student fees), and various other programs.                  
In addition, funds were transferred from special funds, collections             
of State revenues were accelerated, and other adjustments were                  
made.                                                                           

As in the prior year, the economic and fiscal assumptions on which              
the 1992-93 Budget Act was based proved to be too optimistic.                   
As the recession in the State entered its third year, with no                   
real upturn predicted until 1994, State revenues again lagged                   
projections. The Department of Finance projects current-year revenues           
will be about $2.4 billion below projections and expenditures                   
$300 million higher. As a result, the Department predicts the                   
General Fund will end at June 30, 1993 with a fund balance deficit              
of about $2.2 billion, almost unchanged from June 30, 1992. The                 
projected negative balance of the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties       
is $2.75 billion.                                                               

1993-94 Budget. The 1993-94 Budget represents the third consecutive             
year of extremely difficult budget choices for the State, in view               
of the continuing recession. The Budget Act, signed on June 30,
1993, provides for General Fund expenditures of $38.5 billion,                  
a 6.3% decline from the prior year. Revenues are projected at                   
$40.6 billion, about $400 million below the prior year. To bring                
the budget into balance, the Budget Act and related legislation                 
provided for transfer of $2.6 billion of local property taxes                   
to school districts, thus relieving State support obligations;                  
reductions in health and welfare expenditures; reductions in support            
for higher education institutions; a two-year suspension of the                 
renters' tax credit; and miscellaneous cuts in general government               
spending and certain one-time and accounting adjustments. There                 
were no general state tax increases, but a 0.5% temporary state                 
sales tax scheduled to expire on June 30 was extended for six                   
months, and dedicated to support local government public safety                 
costs.                                                                          

As part of the 1993-94 Budget, the Governor implemented a plan                  
to repay the accumulated $2.8 billion deficit in the Special Fund               
for Economic Uncertainties over 18 months, funding the deficit                  
with external borrowing maturing not later than December 31, 1994.              
About $1.6 billion of the deficit was repaid by December 1993,                  
with the balance to be paid by December 31, 1994. Taking this                   
borrowing into account, the Department of Finance projected in                  
July, 1993, that the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties would              
have a balance of about $600 million at June 30, 1994, and about                
$100 million at June 30, 1995.                                                  

The 1994-95 Governor's Budget Proposal, released January 7, 1994,               
projects that because of the continuation of the recession, the                 
1993-94 fiscal year will end with a negative fund balance $1.7                  
billion worse than originally planned, even though State revenues               
have been close to projections through the first six months of                  
the 1993-94 fiscal year.                                                        

To produce a balanced budget in 1994-95, the Governor proposes                  
further cuts in health and welfare costs, and requests additional               
federal aid of over $3 billion for costs associated with undocumented           
foreign immigrants and for health and welfare programs. There                   
is no assurance these funds will be appropriated by the Congress.               

On January 17, 1994, a major earthquake struck Los Angeles, causing             
widespread property damage to public and private structures and                 
facilities, estimated preliminarily at in excess of $15 billion.                
Large amounts of federal aid are expected, and additional state                 
resources will be made available. It is too soon to assess the                  
short- or long-term impacts of the earthquake on the regional                   
and state economies, and on the fiscal condition of local and                   
state government.                                                               

The State's severe financial difficulties for the current budget                
year will result in continued pressure upon almost all local governments,       
particularly school districts and counties which depend on State                
aid. Despite efforts in recent years to increase taxes and reduce               
governmental expenditures, there can be no assurance that the                   
State will not face budget gaps in the future.                                  

Bond Rating. State general obligation bonds are currently rated                 
"Aa" by Moody's and "A+" by S&P.  Both of these ratings were recently           
reduced from"AAA" levels which the State held until late 1991.                  
There can be no assurance that such ratings will be maintained                  
in the future. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of                  
obligations issued by local California issuers may be unrelated                 
to the creditworthiness of obligations issued by the State of                   
California, and that there is no obligation on the part of the                  
State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of                 
default.                                                                        

Page 44                                                                         

Legal Proceedings. The State is involved in certain legal proceedings           
(described in the State's recent financial statements) that, if                 
decided against the State, may require the State to make significant            
future expenditures or may substantially impair revenues. The                   
U.S. Supreme Court has granted review of two cases challenging                  
California's "unitary" method of taxing multinational corporations.             
Although this taxing method has since been changed, if the State                
loses these cases, it could be liable for tax refunds and lost                  
receipts of taxes assessed totalling $3.5 billion to $4 billion.                

Obligations of Other Issuers                                                    

Other Issuers of California Municipal Obligations. There are a                  
number of state agencies, instrumentalities and political subdivisions          
of the State that issue Municipal Obligations, some of which may                
be conduit revenue obligations payable from payments from private               
borrowers. These entities are subject to various economic risks                 
and uncertainties, and the credit quality of the securities issued              
by them may vary considerably from the credit quality of the obligations        
backed by the full faith and credit of the State.                               

State Assistance. Property tax revenues received by local governments           
declined more than 50% following passage of Proposition 13. Subsequently,       
the California Legislature enacted measures to provide for the                  
redistribution of the State's General Fund surplus to local agencies,           
the reallocation of certain State revenues to local agencies and                
the assumption of certain governmental functions by the State                   
to assist municipal issuers to raise revenues. Through 1990-91,                 
local assistance (including public schools) accounted for around                
75% of General Fund spending. To reduce State General Fund support              
for school districts, the 1992-93 and 1993-94 Budget Acts caused                
local governments to transfer $3.9 billion of property tax revenues             
to school districts, representing loss of almost all of the post-Proposition    
13 "bailout" aid. The largest share of these transfers came from                
counties, and the balance from cities, special districts and redevelopment      
agencies. In order to make up this shortfall, the Legislature                   
has proposed and voters approved dedicating 0.5% of the sales                   
tax to counties and cities for public safety purposes. In addition,             
the Legislature has changed laws to relieve local governments                   
of certain mandates, allowing them to reduce costs.                             

To the extent the State should be constrained by its Article XIIIB              
appropriations limit, or its obligation to conform to Proposition               
98, or other fiscal considerations, the absolute level, or the                  
rate of growth, of State assistance to local governments may be                 
reduced. Any such reductions in State aid could compound the serious            
fiscal constraints already experienced by many local governments,               
particularly counties. At least one rural county (Butte) publicly               
announced that it might enter bankruptcy proceedings in August                  
1990, although such plans were put off after the Governor approved              
legislation to provide additional funds for the county. Other                   
counties have also indicated that their budgetary condition is                  
extremely grave. The Richmond Unified School District (Contra                   
Costa County) entered bankruptcy proceedings in May 1991 but the                
proceedings have been dismissed.                                                

Assessment Bonds. California Municipal Obligations which are assessment         
bonds may be adversely affected by a general decline in real estate             
values or a slowdown in real estate sales activity. In many cases,              
such bonds are secured by land which is undeveloped at the time                 
of issuance but anticipated to be developed within a few years                  
after issuance. In the event of such reduction or slowdown, such                
development may not occur or may be delayed, thereby increasing                 
the risk of a default on the bonds. Because the special assessments             
or taxes securing these bonds are not the personal liability of                 
the owners of the property assessed, the lien on the property                   
is the only security for the bonds. Moreover, in most cases the                 
issuer of these bonds is not required to make payments on the                   
bonds in the event of delinquency in the payment of assessments                 
or taxes, except from amounts, if any, in a reserve fund established            
for the bonds.                                                                  

California Long-Term Lease Obligations. Certain California long-term            
lease obligations, though typically payable from the general fund               
of the municipality, are subject to "abatement" in the event the                
facility being leased is unavailable for beneficial use and occupancy           
by the municipality during the term of the lease. Abatement is                  
not a default, and there may be no remedies available to the holders            
of the certificates evidencing the lease obligation in the event                
abatement occurs. The most common cases of abatement are failure                
to complete construction of the facility before the end of the                  
period during which lease payments have been capitalized and uninsured          
casualty losses to the facility (e.g., due to earthquake). In                   
the event abatement                                                             

Page 45                                                                         

occurs with respect to a lease obligation, lease payments may                   
be interrupted (if all available insurance proceeds and reserves                
are exhausted) and the certificates may not be paid when due.                   

Several years ago the Richmond Unified School District (the "District")         
entered into a lease transaction in which certain existing properties           
of the District were sold and leased back in order to obtain funds              
to cover operating deficits. Following a fiscal crisis in which                 
the District's finances were taken over by a State receiver (including          
a brief period under bankruptcy court protection), the District                 
failed to make rental payments on this lease, resulting in a lawsuit            
by the Trustee for the Certificate of Participation holders, in                 
which the State was named defendant (on the grounds that it controlled          
the District's finances). One of the defenses raised in answer                  
to this lawsuit was the invalidity of the District's lease. The                 
trial court has upheld the validity of the lease and the case                   
is expected to be settled, but, if it is not, further appeals                   
may occur. Any ultimate judgement against the Trustee may have                  
adverse implications for lease transactions of a similar nature                 
by other California entities.                                                   

Other Considerations. The repayment of industrial development                   
securities secured by real property may be affected by California               
laws limiting foreclosure rights of creditors. Securities backed                
by health care and hospital revenues may be affected by changes                 
in State regulations governing cost reimbursements to health care               
providers under Medi-Cal (the State's Medicaid program), including              
risks related to the policy of awarding exclusive contracts to                  
certain hospitals.                                                              

Limitations on ad valorem property taxes may particularly affect                
"tax allocation" bonds issued by California redevelopment agencies.             
Such bonds are secured solely by the increase in assessed valuation             
of a redevelopment project area after the start of redevelopment                
activity. In the event that assessed values in the redevelopment                
project decline (e.g., because of a major natural disaster such                 
as an earthquake), the tax increment revenue may be insufficient                
to make principal and interest payments on these bonds. Both Moody's            
and S&P suspended ratings on California tax allocation bonds after              
the enactment of Articles XIIIA and XIIIB, and only resumed such                
ratings on a selective basis.                                                   

Proposition 87, approved by California voters in 1988, requires                 
that all revenues produced by a tax rate increase go directly                   
to the taxing entity which increased such tax rate to repay that                
entity's general obligation indebtedness. As a result, redevelopment            
agencies (which, typically, are the issuers of tax allocation                   
securities) no longer receive an increase in tax increment when                 
taxes on property in the project area are increased to repay voter-approved     
bonded indebtedness.                                                            

The effect of these various constitutional and statutory changes                
upon the ability of California municipal securities issuers to                  
pay interest and principal on their obligations remains unclear.                
Furthermore, other measures affecting the taxing or spending authority          
of California or its political subdivisions may be approved or                  
enacted in the future. Legislation has been or may be introduced                
which would modify existing taxes or other revenue-raising measures             
or which either would further limit or, alternatively, would increase           
the abilities of state and local governments to impose new taxes                
or increase existing taxes. It is not presently possible to predict             
the extent to which any such legislation will be enacted. Nor                   
is it presently possible to determine the impact of any such legislation        
on California Municipal Obligations in which the Trust may invest,              
future allocations of state revenues to local governments or the                
abilities of state or local governments to pay the interest on,                 
or repay the principal of, such California Municipal Obligations.               

Substantially all of California is within an active geologic region             
subject to major seismic activity. Any California Municipal Obligation          
in the California Insured Trust could be affected by an interruption            
of revenues because of damaged facilities, or, consequently, income             
tax deductions for casualty losses or property tax assessment                   
reductions. Compensatory financial assistance could be constrained              
by the inability of (i) an issuer to have obtained earthquake                   
insurance coverage at reasonable rates; (ii) an insurer to perform              
on its contracts of insurance in the event of widespread losses;                
or (iii) the Federal or State government to appropriate sufficient              
funds within their respective budget limitations.                               

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of                   
some of the financial difficulties which may impact certain issuers             
of Bonds and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description        
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers in the California                
Insured Trust are subject. Additionally, many factors including                 
national economic, social and environmental policies and conditions,            
which are not within the control of the issuers of Bonds, could                 
have an adverse impact on the financial condition to predict whether

or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the                  
issuers of Bonds, the market value or marketability of the Bonds                
or the ability of the respective issuers of the Bonds acquired                  
by the California Insured Trust to pay interest on or principal                 
of the Bonds.                                                                   

California Tax Status                                                           

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, Special Counsel               
to the Fund for California tax matters, under existing California               
income and property tax law applicable to individuals who are                   
California residents:                                                           

The California Insured Trust is not an association taxable as                   
a corporation and the income of the California Insured Trust will               
be treated as the income of the Unit holders under the income                   
tax laws of California.                                                         

Interest on the underlying securities (which may include bonds                  
or other obligations issued by the governments of Puerto Rico,                  
the Virgin Islands, Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands) which                 
is exempt from tax under California personal income tax and property            
tax laws when received by the California Insured Trust will, under              
such laws, retain its status as tax-exempt interest when distributed            
to Unit holders. However, interest on the underlying securities                 
attributed to a Unit holder which is a corporation subject to                   
the California franchise tax laws may be includable in its gross                
income for purposes of determining its California franchise tax.                

Under California income tax law, each Unit holder in the California             
Insured Trust will have a taxable event when the California Insured             
Trust disposes of a security (whether by sale, exchange, redemption             
or payment at maturity) or when the Unit holder redeems or sells                
Units. Because of the requirement that tax cost basis be reduced                
to reflect amortization of bond premium, under some circumstances               
a Unit holder may realize taxable gain when Units are sold or                   
redeemed for an amount equal to, or less than, their original                   
cost. The total tax cost of each Unit to a Unit holder is allocated             
among each of the bond issues held in the California Insured Trust              
(in accordance with the proportion of the California Insured Trust              
comprised by each bond issue) in order to determine his per unit                
tax cost  for each bond issue; and the tax cost reduction requirements          
relating to amortization of bond premium will apply separately                  
to the per unit cost of each bond issue. Unit holders' bases in                 
their Units, and the bases for their fractional interest in each                
California Insured Trust asset, may have to be adjusted for their               
pro rata share of accrued interest received, if any, on securities              
delivered after the Unit holders' respective settlement dates.                  

Under the California personal property tax laws, bonds (including               
the bonds in the California Insured Trust as well as "regular-way"              
and "when-issued" contracts for the purchase of bonds) or any                   
interest therein is exempt from such tax.                                       

Any proceeds paid under an insurance policy issued to the Trustee               
of the Trust with respect to the bonds in the California Insured                
Trust as well as "regular-way" and "when-issued" contracts for                  
the purchase of bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted            
obligations held by the Trustee will be exempt from California                  
personal income tax if, and to the same extent as, such interest                
would have been so exempt if paid by the issuer of the defaulted                
obligations.                                                                    

Under Section 17280(b)(2) of the California Revenue and Taxation                
Code, interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase                
or carry Units of the California Insured Trust is not deductible                
for the purposes of the California personal income tax. While                   
there presently is no California authority interpreting this provision,         
Section 17280(b)(2) directs the California Franchise Tax Board                  
to prescribe regulations determining the proper allocation and                  
apportionment of interest costs for this purpose. The Franchise                 
Tax Board has not yet proposed or prescribed such regulations.                  
In interpreting the generally similar Federal provision, the Internal           
Revenue Service has taken the position that such indebtedness                   
need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of                   
Units (although the Service has not contended that a deduction                  
for interest on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a                  
personal residence or to purchase goods or services for personal                
consumption will be disallowed). In the absence of conflicting                  
regulations or other California authority, the California Franchise             
Tax Board generally has interpreted California statutory tax provisions         
in accord with Internal Revenue Service interpretations of similar              
Federal provisions.

[FN]                                                                            
(1)     The Estimated Current Return is calculated by dividing the              
Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public Offering            
Price. The Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit will                   
vary with changes in fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Portfolio            
Supervisor and the Evaluator and with the principal prepayment,                 
redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of Bonds while the Public                
Offering Price will vary with changes in the offering price of                  
the underlying Bonds; therefore, there is no assurance that the                 
present Estimated Current Return indicated above will be realized               
in the future. The Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using               
a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and                
factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields                 
(which take into account the amortization of premiums and the                   
accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of all of the                 
Bonds in the Trust; (2) takes into account the expenses and sales               
charge associated with each Unit of the Trust; and (3) takes into               
effect the tax-adjusted yield from potential capital gains at                   
the Date of Deposit. Since the market values and estimated retirements          
of the Bonds and the expenses of the Trust will change, there                   
is no assurance that the present Estimated Long-Term Return indicated           
above will be realized in the future. Estimated Current Return                  
and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ because                   
the calculation of the Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the                  
estimated date and amount of principal returned while the Estimated             
Current Return calculations include only Net Annual Interest Income             
and Public Offering Price. Neither rate reflects the true return                
to Unit holders, which is lower, because neither includes the                   
effect of certain delays in distributions to Unit holders. The                  
above figures are based on estimated per Unit cash flows. Estimated             
cash flows will vary with changes in fees and expenses, with changes            
in current interest rates, and with the principal prepayment,                   
redemption, maturity, call, exchange or sale of the underlying                  
Bonds. The estimated cash flows for this Trust are set forth under              
"Estimated Cash Flows to Unit Holders."

Kansas Insured Trust Summary                                                    

The Kansas Insured Trust consists of  seven obligations of issuers              
located in Kansas. The Bond issues in the Trust are either general              
obligations of governmental entities or are revenue bonds payable               
from the income of a specific project or authority. The Bonds                   
in the Trust are divided by purpose of issue and represent the                  
percentage of aggregate principal amount of the Bonds as indicated              
by the following table:

1               Single Family Housing            1.68%    


Each of six Bond issues represents 10% or more of the aggregate                 
principal amount of the Bonds in the Trust or a total of approximately          
98%. The largest issue represents approximately 21%. None of the                
Bonds in the Trust are subject to call within five years of the                 
Date of Deposit, although certain Bonds may be subject to an extraordinary      
call.                                                                           

Approximately 31% of the aggregate principal amount (approximately              
33% of the aggregate offering price) of the Bonds in the Trust                  
were purchased at a premium over par value. Certain of these Bonds              
are subject to redemption pursuant to call provisions in approximately          
7-8 years after the Date of Deposit. See "What Is the First Trust
Combined Series?", "Kansas Insured Trust, Series 26-Portfolio"                  
and "Description of Bond Ratings."                                              

Interest on certain of the Bonds in the Kansas Insured Trust will               
be an item of tax preference for purposes of the Alternative Minimum            
Tax ("AMT"). The investment by non-AMT individual taxpayers in                  
AMT municipal bonds generally results in a higher yield to such                 
bondholders than non-AMT municipal bonds. Since a portion of the                
interest from the Kansas Insured Trust is an AMT preference item,               
the Kansas Insured Trust may be more appropriate for investors                  
who are not subject to AMT.                                                     

Federal and Kansas State Tax-Free Income                                        

The following table shows the approximate marginal taxable yields               
for individuals that are equivalent to tax-exempt yields under                  
combined Federal and state taxes, using published Federal tax                   
rates and state tax rates scheduled to be in effect in 1994. The                
table incorporates increased tax rates for higher-income taxpayers              
that were included in the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993.                   
For cases in which more than one state bracket falls within a                   
Federal bracket, the higher state bracket is combined with the                  
Federal bracket. The combined state and Federal tax rates shown                 
reflect the fact that state tax payments are currently deductible               
for Federal tax purposes. The table illustrates what you would                  
have to earn on taxable investments to equal the tax-exempt yield               
for your income tax bracket. The taxable equivalent yields may                  
be somewhat higher than the equivalent yields indicated in the                  
following table for those individuals who have adjusted gross                   
incomes in excess of $111,800. The table does not reflect the                   
effect of the limitations on itemized deductions and the deduction              
for personal exemptions. They were designed to phase out certain                
benefits of these deductions for higher income taxpayers. These                 
limitations, in effect, raise the maximum marginal Federal tax                  
rate to approximately 44% for taxpayers filing a joint return                   
and entitled to four personal exemptions and to approximately                   
41% for taxpayers filing a single return entitled to only one                   
personal exemption. These limitations are subject to certain maximums,          
which depend on the number of exemptions claimed and the total                  
amount of the taxpayer's itemized deductions. For example, the                  
limitation on itemized deductions will not cause a taxpayer to                  
lose more than 80% of his allowable itemized deductions, with                   
certain exceptions.

Certain Considerations                                                          

Since the Fund will invest substantially all of its assets in                   
Kansas municipal securities, the Fund is susceptible to political               
and economic factors affecting issuers of Kansas municipal securities.          
According to the 1990 census, 2,477,574 people lived in Kansas,                 
representing a 4.8% increase over the 1980 census. Based on these               
numbers, Kansas ranked thirty-second in the nation in population                
size. During Fiscal Year 1993 (July 1, 1992 to June 30, 1993),                  
the population of Kansas reached 2,523,000 with a growth rate                   
projected at 1.1%.                                                              

Based on statistics provided by the Kansas Department of Commerce               
& Housing, real personal income in Kansas grew at a rate of 3.9%                
in 1992, and for calendar year 1993 the projected rate is 4.3%.                 
Both rates are slowed by the loss of high-paying manufacturing                  
jobs. Kansas ranks 20th in the United States in average per capita              
income of $20,300.                                                              

In Fiscal Year 1993, non-farm wage and salary employment in Kansas              
showed an increase of 37,100 jobs (3.3%) with a total of 1,142,500              
persons employed. Despite heavy layoffs in the transportation                   
sector (a 10.6% loss), total manufacturing employment decreased                 
only 1%. Layoffs by major employers in the wholesale and retail                 
sectors were offset by general growth with an additional 6,800                  
jobs added during Fiscal Year 1993, a 2.4% increase. The service                
sector added 5,400 jobs during this period. The unemployment rate               
for calendar year 1992 was 4.2%, and the preliminary seasonally                 
adjusted rate for December 1993 was 4.8%.                                       

Kansas continues to be among the nation's top agricultural states,              
ranking first in wheat and sorghum production. The total value                  
of crops produced in Kansas in Fiscal Year 1993 was $86.5 billion,              
with Kansas ranking seventh in cash receipts from farm marketing.               
Kansas also ranks fifth in the nation in livestock production,                  
accounting for $4.7 billion in farm income.                                     

Total Kansas exports of manufactured goods increased 18% to $2.38               
billion during the 1992 calendar year while agricultural exports                
showed an increase of 25% to $2.48 billion. These two export figures            
show the real diversity of the Kansas economy. Leading the way                  
in exports for manufactured goods is transportation equipment                   
with $767 million. Agricultural exports continue to be led by                   
wheat/flour as that group's leading export commodity.                           

In Fiscal Year 1993, revenues rose in Kansas to $2.9 billion,                   
a 19% increase over 1992 revenues. This increase was attributable               
to both larger income and sales taxes, as the economy continued                 
to expand and a higher sales tax rate became effective. An 8%                   
increase in Fiscal Year 1993 expenditures permitted Kansas to                   
realize an operating surplus of $242 million. The state budgeted                
a 1994 revenue increase equal to 3.5% and an expenditure increase               
equal to 17.1%. The increase in expenditures is attributable to                 
a $244 million, or 21%, expansion of local school aid funding.                  
Prior to the 1993 surplus, Kansas incurred three consecutive operating          
deficits which aggregated $318 million. The state plans 1994 and                
1995 operating deficits equal to $115 and $32 million, respectively.            
These deficits have been planned in order to comply with statutory              
requirements                                                                    

Page 52                                                                         

which limit General Fund ending balances to 7.5% of expenditures                
for 1995 and each year thereafter. The General Fund 1993 ending                 
balance was an ample 14.3% of expenditures.                                     

Kansas is prohibited from incurring general obligation debt. It                 
has incurred a minimal amount of annual appropriation debt and                  
net tax-supported debt in the approximate amount of $835 million.               
Debt per capita in Kansas in Fiscal Year 1993 amounted to $235,                 
and annual debt service as a percentage of expenditures was approximately       
1.4%. Kansas is not expected, over the intermediate term, to issue              
significant amounts of tax-supported debt. However, it is expected              
to issue before 1998 approximately $515 million of revenue bonds,               
the proceeds of which will be used for highway improvements.                    

Expenditures totaling $6.7 billion from all funding sources were                
approved for Fiscal Year 1994. Approximately 59.2 percent of the                
total budget is for aid to local units of government (32.9 percent)             
or for direct assistance payments to or on behalf of individuals                
(26.3 percent). Aid to local school districts, community colleges               
and area vocational-technical schools accounts for 82.1 percent                 
of the aid expenditures. The aid recommendation also includes                   
$127.7 million for local road and bridge programs.                              

The State General Fund for Fiscal Year 1994 accounts for 46.8                   
percent of the State's financing, Special Revenue Funds accounts                
for 32.3 percent, Trust and Agency Funds 9.9 percent, and the                   
Highway Fund 8.8 percent. The State General Fund is obtained from               
individual income taxes (38.1 percent), sales and use taxes (39.4               
percent), corporate income tax (6.4 percent) and other income                   
and excise taxes and other revenue (16.1 percent).                              

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of                   
some of the financial difficulties which may impact certain issuers             
of Bonds and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description        
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers in the Kansas Trust              
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic,            
social, and environmental policies and conditions, which are not                
within the control of the issuers of Bonds, could affect or could               
have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the State                  
and various agencies and political subdivisions located in the                  
State. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent               
such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of Bonds,                  
the market value or marketability of the Bonds, or the ability                  
of the respective issuers of the Bonds acquired by the Kansas                   
Trust to pay interest on or principal of the Bonds.                             

Kansas Tax Status                                                               

In the opinion of Chapman and Cutler, counsel to the Kansas Trust               
for Kansas tax matters, assuming interest on the Bonds is excludable            
from gross income under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code                
of 1986 as amended, under existing Kansas law:                                  

The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for Kansas             
income tax purposes;                                                            

Each Unit holder of the Trust will be treated as the owner of                   
a pro rata portion of the Trust, and the income and deductions                  
of the Trust will therefore be treated as income of the Unit holder             
under Kansas law;                                                               

Interest on Bonds issued after December 31, 1987 by the State                   
of Kansas or any of its political subdivisions will be exempt                   
from income taxation imposed on individuals, corporations and                   
fiduciaries (other than insurance companies, banks, trust companies             
or savings and loan associations). However, interest on Bonds                   
issued prior to January 1, 1988 by the State of Kansas or any                   
of its political subdivisions will not be exempt from income taxation           
imposed on individuals, corporations and fiduciaries (other than                
insurance companies, banks, trust companies or savings and loan                 
associations) unless the laws of the State of Kansas authorizing                
the issuance of such Bonds specifically exempt the interest on                  
the Bonds from income taxation by the State of Kansas;                          

Interest on Bonds issued by the State of Kansas or any of its                   
political subdivisions will be subject to the tax imposed on banks,             
trust companies and savings and loan associations under Article                 
11, Chapter 79 of the Kansas statutes;                                          

Interest on Bonds issued by the State of Kansas or any of its                   
political subdivisions will be subject to the tax imposed on insurance          
companies under Article 40, Chapter 28 of the Kansas statutes                   
unless the laws of the State of Kansas authorizing the issuance                 
of such Bonds specifically exempt the interest on the Bonds from                
income taxation by the State of Kansas; interest on the Bonds                   
which is exempt from Kansas income taxation                                     

Page 53                                                                         

when received by the Trust will continue to be exempt when distributed          
to a Unit holder (other than a bank, trust company or savings                   
and loan association);                                                          

Each Unit holder of the Trust will recognize gain or loss for                   
Kansas income tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether           
by sale, exchange, payment on maturity, retirement or otherwise)                
or if the Unit holder redeems or sells Units of the Trust to the                
extent that such transaction results in a recognized gain or loss               
for federal income tax purposes;                                                

Interest received by the Trust on the Bonds is exempt from intangibles          
taxation imposed by any counties, cities and townships pursuant                 
to present Kansas law; and                                                      

No opinion is expressed regarding whether the gross earnings derived            
from the Units is subject to intangibles taxation imposed by any                
counties, cities and townships pursuant to present Kansas law.

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES 211                                             

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets, including            
the portfolios, of The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-Multi-State:      
California Trust, Series 8 and Kansas Trust, Series 26, comprising              
The First Trust Combined Series 211 (the Trusts) as of the opening              
of business on February 17, 1994. These statements of net assets                
are the responsibility of the Trusts' Sponsor. Our responsibility               
is to express an opinion on these statements of net assets based                
on our audit.                                                                   

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing           
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the                 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statements               
of net assets are free of material misstatement. An audit includes              
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and                 
disclosures in the statements of net assets. Our procedures included            
confirmation of the letter of credit held by the Trustee and allocated          
among the Trusts on February 17, 1994. An audit also includes                   
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates              
made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall presentation             
of the statements of net assets. We believe that our audit of                   
the statements of net assets provides a reasonable basis for our                
opinion.                                                                        

In our opinion, the statements of net assets referred to above                  
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position                
of The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-Multi-State: California           
Trust, Series 8 and Kansas Trust, Series 26, comprising The First               
Trust Combined Series 211 at the opening of business on February
17, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

the opening of business on the Date of Deposit and the cost to                  
the applicable Trust are the same. The offering price is determined             
by the Evaluator.                                                               

(2) Pursuant to delivery statements relating to contracts to purchase           
bonds, an irrevocable letter of credit has been allocated among                 
the Trusts as collateral. The amount of available letter of credit              
and the amount expected to be utilized for each Trust is shown                  
below. The amount expected to be utilized is (a) the cost to the                
respective Trust of the principal amount of the bonds to be purchased,          
(b) accrued interest on those bonds to the Date of Deposit, and                 
(c) accrued interest on those bonds from the Date of Deposit to

NOTES TO PORTFOLIOS 

The following Notes to Portfolios pertain to the information contained          
in the Trust Portfolios (the California Insured Trust, Series                   
8 on page 49, and the Kansas Insured Trust, Series 26 on page

(1) Sponsor's contracts to purchase Bonds were entered into during              
the period from July 14, 1992 to February 15, 1994. All contracts               
to purchase Bonds are expected to be settled on or prior to February
25, 1994 unless otherwise indicated.

Neither Cost of Bonds to Sponsor nor Profit or (Loss) to Sponsor                
reflects underwriting profits or losses received or incurred by                 
the Sponsor through its participation in underwriting syndicates                
but such amounts reflect the cost of insurance obtained by the                  
Sponsor prior to the Date of Deposit for individual Bonds. The                  
Offering and Bid Prices of Bonds were determined by Securities                  
Evaluation Service, Inc., certain shareholders of which are officers            
of the Sponsor.                                                                 

(2) All ratings are by Standard & Poor's Corporation unless otherwise           
indicated (NR indicates "No Rating"). Such ratings were obtained                
from a municipal bond information reporting service.                            

(3) There is shown under this heading the year in which each issue              
of Bonds initially is redeemable and the redemption price for                   
that year or, if currently redeemable, the redemption price in                  
effect on the Date of Deposit. Issues of Bonds are redeemable                   
at declining prices (but not below par value) in subsequent years               
except for original issue discount Bonds which are redeemable                   
at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original                  
issue discount accreted to the redemption date plus, if applicable,             
some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years.             
"S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to                  
an issue of Bonds. In addition, certain Bonds in the portfolio                  
may be redeemed in whole or in part other than by operation of                  
the stated redemption or sinking fund provisions under certain                  
unusual or extraordinary circumstances specified in the instruments             
setting forth the terms and provisions of such Bonds. See "What
Is the First Trust Combined Series?" for a description of certain               
of such unusual or extraordinary circumstances. Redemption pursuant             
to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant to                   
sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed                   
Bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium                
over par or for original issue discount Bonds a premium over the                
accreted value. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in                  
the Fund at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed,           
this will represent a loss of capital when compared with the original           
Public Offering Price of the Units. Conversely, to the extent                   
that the Bonds were acquired at a price lower than the redemption               
price, this will represent an increase in capital when compared                 
to the original Public Offering Price of the Units, excluding                   
the effect of the sales charge on the Units. Distributions will                 
generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise          
have been paid with respect to redeemed Bonds and there will be                 
distributed to Unit holders the principal amount and any premium                
received on such redemption (except to the extent the proceeds                  
of the redeemed Bonds are used to pay for Unit redemptions). The                
estimated current return and the long-term return in this event                 
may be affected by such redemptions. For the Federal and state                  
tax effect on Unit holders of such redemptions and resultant distributions,     
see "The First Trust Combined Series-What is the Federal Tax Status             
of Unit Holders?",   "California Insured Trust Summary-California               
Tax Status" and "Kansas Insured Trust Summary-Kansas Tax Status."               

(4) Ratings by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Such ratings were

(5) Insurance has been obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters,           
the Sponsor or others prior to the Date of Deposit. No insurance

Standard & Poor's Corporation. A brief description of the applicable            
Standard & Poor's Corporation rating symbols and their meanings                 
follow:                                                                         

A Standard & Poor's corporate or municipal bond rating is a current             
assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect                   
to a specific debt obligation. This assessment may take into consideration      
obligors such as guarantors, insurers, or lessees.                              

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold               
a security, inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price                  
or suitability for a particular investor.                                       

The ratings are based on current information furnished by the                   
issuer or obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it                   
considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit                 
in connection with any rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited           
financial information. The ratings may be changed, suspended or                 
withdrawn as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, such                 
information, or for other circumstances.                                        

The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:     

I.      Likelihood of default-capacity and willingness of the obligor           
as to the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal                 
in accordance with the terms of the obligation;                                 

II.     Nature of and provisions of the obligation;                             

III.    Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation        
in the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements                
under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors'                
rights.                                                                         

AAA-Bonds rated AAA have the highest rating assigned by Standard                
& Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay               
principal is extremely strong.**

Capital Guaranty Insurance Company are automatically rated "AAA"                
by Standard & Poor's Corporation.                                               

AA-Bonds rated AA have a very strong capacity to pay interest                   
and repay principal and differ from the highest rated issues only               
in small degree.                                                                

A-Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay                
principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse            
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than                
bonds in higher rated categories.                                               

BBB-Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity                 
to pay interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit              
adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or                  
changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity           
to pay interest and repay principal for bonds in this category                  
than for bonds in higher rated categories.                                      

Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified           
by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing               
within the major rating categories.                                             

Provisional Ratings: The letter "p" indicates that the rating                   
is provisional. A provisional rating assumes the successful completion          
of the project being financed by the bonds being rated and indicates            
that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely                
dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project.             
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent                
to completion of the project, makes no comment on the likelihood                
of, or the risk of default upon failure of, such completion. The                
investor should exercise his/her own judgment with respect to                   
such likelihood and risk.                                                       

Credit Watch: Credit Watch highlights potential changes in ratings              
of bonds and other fixed income securities. It focuses on events                
and trends which place companies and government units under special             
surveillance by S&P's 180-member analytical staff. These may include            
mergers, voter referendums, actions by regulatory authorities,                  
or developments gleaned from analytical reviews. Unless otherwise               
noted, a rating decision will be made within 90 days. Issues appear             
on Credit Watch where an event, situation, or deviation from trends             
occurred and needs to be evaluated as to its impact on credit                   
ratings. A listing, however, does not mean a rating change is                   
inevitable. Since S&P continuously monitors all of its ratings,                 
Credit Watch is not intended to include all issues under review.                
Thus, rating changes will occur without issues appearing on Credit              
Watch.

Moody's Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable           
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings               
follow:                                                                         

Aaa-Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality.             
They carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally             
referred to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by                  
a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is                   
secure. While the various protective elements are likely to change,             
such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair                   
the fundamentally strong position of such issues. Their safety                  
is so absolute that with the occasional exception of oversupply                 
in a few specific instances, characteristically, their market                   
value is affected solely by money market fluctuations.                          

Aa-Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by                 
all standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what                   
are generally known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower                   
than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as                 
large as in Aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements                
may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present              
which make the long term risks appear somewhat larger than in                   
Aaa securities. Their market value is virtually immune to all                   
but money market influences, with the occasional exception of                   
oversupply in a few specific instances.                                         

A-Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes          
and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors             
giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate,              
but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to                   
impairment sometime in the future. The market value of A-rated                  
bonds may be influenced to some degree by economic performance                  
during a sustained period of depressed business conditions, but,                
during periods of normalcy, A-rated bonds frequently move in parallel           
with Aaa and Aa obligations, with the occasional exception of                   
oversupply in a few specific instances.                                         

A 1 and Baa 1-Bonds which are rated A 1 and Baa 1 offer the maximum             
in security within their quality group, can be bought for possible              
upgrading in quality, and additionally, afford the investor an                  
opportunity to gauge more precisely the relative attractiveness                 
of offerings in the market place.                                               

Baa-Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations;       
i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest            
payments and principal security appear adequate for the present                 
but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically     
unreliable over any great length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding           
investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics         
as well. The market value of Baa-rated bonds is more sensitive                  
to changes in economic circumstances, and aside from occasional                 
speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class, Baa                   
market valuations will move in parallel with Aaa, Aa, and A obligations         
during periods of economic normalcy, except in instances of oversupply.         

Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of                  
a generic rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that                  
the bond ranks at the high end of its category; the modifier 2                  
indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates that                
the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category.                

Con.(---)-Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion              
of some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally.       
These are bonds secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction,         
(b) earnings of projects unseasoned in operation experience, (c)                
rentals which begin when facilities are completed, or (d) payments              
to which some other limiting condition attaches. Parenthetical                  
rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of construction          
or elimination of basis of condition.

Estimated Cash Flows to Unit Holders

The tables below set forth the per Unit estimated monthly distributions         
of interest and principal to Unit holders. The tables assume the                
receipt of principal of the underlying Bonds upon their maturity                
or expected retirement date, no changes in expenses, no changes                 
in the current interest rates, no exchanges, redemptions, sales                 
or prepayments of the underlying Bonds prior to their maturity                  
or expected retirement date. To the extent the foregoing assumptions            
change, actual distributions will vary.

PROSPECTUS





Part One





Dated November 25, 1998



Note: Part One of this Prospectus may not be distributed unless accompanied by


Part Two and Part Three.


In the opinion of Counsel, interest income to the Trust and to Unit holders,
with certain exceptions, is exempt under existing law from all Federal income
taxes.  In addition, the interest income is, in the opinion of Special
Counsel, exempt to the extent indicated from Ohio State and local income
taxes.  Capital gains, if any, are subject to tax.



The Trust



The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds - Multi-State Ohio Trust, Series 10
(the "Trust") is an insured and fixed portfolio of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of municipalities and other governmental
authorities within the State of Ohio, the interest on which is, in the opinion
of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental authorities, exempt
from all Federal income taxes and from Ohio State and local income taxes under
existing law.  At October 16, 1998, each Unit represented a 1/1,922 undivided
interest in the principal and net income of the Trust (see "The Fund" in Part
Two).


The Units being offered by this Prospectus are issued and outstanding Units
which have been purchased by the Sponsor in the secondary market or from the
Trustee after having been tendered for redemption.  The profit or loss
resulting from the sale of Units will accrue to the Sponsor.  No proceeds from
the sale of Units will be received by the Trust.



Public Offering Price



The Public Offering Price of the Units is equal to the aggregate value of the
Bonds in the Portfolio of the Trust divided by the number of Units
outstanding, plus a sales charge of 3.8% of the Public Offering Price (3.950%
of the amount invested).  At October 16, 1998, the Public Offering Price per
Unit was $447.03 plus net interest accrued to date of settlement (three
business days after such date) of $3.03 and $9.14 for the monthly and semi-
annual distribution plans, respectively (see "Market for Units" in Part Two).



Please retain all parts of this Prospectus for future reference.


THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR
ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL
OFFENSE.

Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return



Estimated Current Return to Unit holders under the semi-annual distribution
plan was 4.11% per annum on October 16, 1998, and 4.01% under the monthly
distribution plan.  Estimated Long-Term Return to Unit holders under the semi-
annual distribution plan was .42% per annum on October 16, 1998, and .32%
under the monthly distribution plan.  Estimated Current Return is calculated
by dividing the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public
Offering Price.  Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula
which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative
weightings of the market values, yields (which take into account the
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated
retirements of all of the Bonds in the Trust and (2) takes into account a
compounding factor and the expenses and sales charge associated with each Unit
of the Trust.  Since the market values and estimated retirements of the Bonds
and the expenses of the Trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return indicated
above will be realized in the future.  Estimated Current Return and Estimated
Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the calculation of the
Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal
returned while the Estimated Current Return calculations include only Net
Annual Interest Income and Public Offering Price.  The above figures are based
on estimated per Unit cash flows.  Estimated cash flows will vary with changes
in fees and expenses, with changes in current interest rates, and with the
principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, call, exchange or sale of the
underlying Bonds.  See "What are Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-
Term Return?" in Part Two.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO



July 31, 1998


(a)   Shown under this heading are the year in which each issue of Bonds is
initially redeemable and the redemption price in that year or, if
currently redeemable, the redemption price at July 31, 1998.  Unless
otherwise indicated, each issue continues to be redeemable at declining
prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for zero coupon bonds
which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount
of original issue discount accreted to the redemption date plus, if
applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years.  "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to
an issue of bonds.  In addition, certain bonds are sometimes redeemable
in whole or in part other than by operation of the stated redemption or
sinking fund provisions under specified unusual or extraordinary
circumstances.  Approximately 89% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Bonds in the Trust is currently redeemable.


(b)   The ratings shown are those effective at July 31, 1998.


(c)   Insurance has been obtained by the Bond issuer.  No premium is payable
by the Trust.


(d)   These Bonds have no stated interest rate ("zero coupon bonds") and,
accordingly, will have no periodic interest payments to the Trust.  Upon
maturity, the holders of these bonds are entitled to receive 100% of the
stated principal amount.  The Bonds were issued at an original issue
discount on August 6, 1985 at a price of 4.849% of their original
principal amount.


(e)   The Trust consists of three obligations of issuers located in Ohio.
None of the Bonds in the Trust are general obligations of a governmental
entity.  All issues are revenue bonds payable from the income of a
specific project or authority and are divided by purpose of issue as
follows:  Single Family Housing, 1; and Miscellaneous, 2.  Approximately
11% of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds consists of single
family residential mortgage revenue bonds.  Each of the Bond issues
represents 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds in
the Trust.  The largest such issue represents approximately 51%.

THE FIRST TRUST OF INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS - MULTI-STATE

OHIO TRUST, SERIES 10






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1.  Significant accounting policies


Security valuation -


Bonds are stated at values as determined by Securities Evaluation Service,
Inc. (the Evaluator), certain shareholders of which are officers of the
Sponsor.  The bond values are based on (1) current bid prices for the bonds
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to
those held by the Trust, (2) current bid prices for comparable bonds, (3)
appraisal or (4) any combination of the above (see Note 3).


Security cost -


The Trust's cost of its portfolio is based on the offering prices of the bonds
on the Date of Deposit, September 30, 1986.  The premium or discount
(including original issue discount) existing at the Date of Deposit is not
being amortized.  Realized gain (loss) from bond transactions is reported on
an identified cost basis.  Sales and redemptions of bonds are recorded on the
trade date.


Federal income taxes -


The Trust is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes.  Each unit holder is
considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust and,
accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes.






Expenses of the Trust -



In addition to insurance coverage acquired by the Trust (see Note 3), the
Trust pays a fee for Trustee services which is based on $1.05 and $.55 per
$1,000 principal amount of Bonds for those portions of the Trust under the
monthly and semi-annual distribution plans, respectively.  Prior to September
1, 1995, the Trustee was United States Trust Company of New York; effective
September 1, 1995, The Chase Manhattan Bank succeeded United States Trust
Company of New York as Trustee.  Additionally, a fee of $900 annually is
payable to the Evaluator and the Trust pays all related expenses of the
Trustee and recurring financial reporting costs.


2.  Unrealized appreciation and depreciation


An analysis of net unrealized appreciation at July 31, 1998 follows:








Unrealized appreciation                             $186,283
Unrealized depreciation                                    -
                                                    ________

                                                    $186,283
                                                    ========











3.  Insurance


The Trust has acquired insurance coverage which provides for the scheduled
payments of principal and interest on all bonds in its portfolio and one issue
is also insured by insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds (see Note (c)
to portfolio).  While insurance coverage acquired by an issuer of bonds
continues in force so long as the bonds are outstanding and the insurer
remains in business, insurance coverage acquired by the Trust is effective
only while the bonds are owned by the Trust and, in the event of disposition
of such a bond by the Trustee, the insurance terminates as to such bond on the
date of disposition.  Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of Financial
Guaranty Insurance Company, in the event of a sale of a bond from the
portfolio, the Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance for such
bond upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the
proceeds of the sale of such bond.  Annual insurance premiums payable by the
Trust in future years, assuming no change in the portfolio, would be $328.


The valuation of bonds does not include any amount attributable to the
insurance acquired by the Trust as there has been no default in the payment of
principal or interest on the bonds in the portfolio as of the date of these
financial statements and, in the opinion of the Sponsor, the bonds are being
quoted in the market at a value which does not reflect a significant risk of
such default.


4.  Other information


Cost to investors -


The cost to initial investors of units of the Trust was based on the aggregate
offering price of the bonds on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a
sales charge of 4.8% of the public offering price which is equivalent to
approximately 5.042% of the net amount invested.


Distributions to unit holders -


Distributions of net interest income to unit holders are made monthly or semi-
annually.  Such income distributions per unit, on an accrual basis, were as
follows:








  Type of                                   Year ended July 31,

This Prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an

This Prospectus does not contain all the information set forth in the
registration statement and exhibits relating thereto, which the Trust has

PROSPECTUS





Part One





Dated November 25, 1998



Note: Part One of this Prospectus may not be distributed unless accompanied by


Part Two and Part Three.


In the opinion of Counsel, interest income to the Trust and to Unit holders,
with certain exceptions, is exempt under existing law from all Federal income
taxes.  In addition, the interest income is, in the opinion of Special
Counsel, exempt to the extent indicated from Pennsylvania State and local
income taxes.  Capital gains, if any, are subject to tax.



The Trust



The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds - Multi-State, Pennsylvania Trust,
Series 9 (the "Trust") is an insured and fixed portfolio of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of municipalities and other governmental
authorities within the State of Pennsylvania, the interest on which is, in the
opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental authorities,
exempt from all Federal income taxes and from Pennsylvania State and local
income taxes under existing law.  At October 16, 1998, each Unit represented a
1/1,497 undivided interest in the principal and net income of the Trust (see
"The Fund" in Part Two).


The Units being offered by this Prospectus are issued and outstanding Units
which have been purchased by the Sponsor in the secondary market or from the
Trustee after having been tendered for redemption.  The profit or loss
resulting from the sale of Units will accrue to the Sponsor.  No proceeds from
the sale of Units will be received by the Trust.



Public Offering Price



The Public Offering Price of the Units is equal to the aggregate value of the
Bonds in the Portfolio of the Trust divided by the number of Units
outstanding, plus a sales charge of 5.1% of the Public Offering Price (5.374%
of the amount invested).  At October 16, 1998, the Public Offering Price per
Unit was $335.73 plus net interest accrued to date of settlement (three
business days after such date) of $2.25 and $7.54 for the monthly and semi-
annual distribution plans, respectively (see "Market for Units" in Part Two).



Please retain all parts of this Prospectus for future reference.


THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR
ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL
OFFENSE.

Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return



Estimated Current Return to Unit holders under the semi-annual distribution
plan was 4.78% per annum on October 16, 1998, and 4.66% under the monthly
distribution plan.  Estimated Long-Term Return to Unit holders under the semi-
annual distribution plan was 3.38% per annum on October 16, 1998, and 3.25%
under the monthly distribution plan.  Estimated Current Return is calculated
by dividing the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public
Offering Price.  Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula
which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative
weightings of the market values, yields (which take into account the
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated
retirements of all of the Bonds in the Trust and (2) takes into account a
compounding factor and the expenses and sales charge associated with each Unit
of the Trust.  Since the market values and estimated retirements of the Bonds
and the expenses of the Trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return indicated
above will be realized in the future.  Estimated Current Return and Estimated
Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the calculation of the
Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal
returned while the Estimated Current Return calculations include only Net
Annual Interest Income and Public Offering Price.  The above figures are based
on estimated per Unit cash flows.  Estimated cash flows will vary with changes
in fees and expenses, with changes in current interest rates, and with the
principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, call, exchange or sale of the
underlying Bonds.  See "What are Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-
Term Return?" in Part Two.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO



July 31, 1998


(a)   Shown under this heading are the year in which each issue of Bonds is
initially redeemable and the redemption price in that year or, if
currently redeemable, the redemption price at July 31, 1998.  Unless
otherwise indicated, each issue continues to be redeemable at declining
prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for zero coupon bonds
which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount
of original issue discount accreted to the redemption date plus, if
applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years.  "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to
an issue of bonds.  In addition, certain bonds are sometimes redeemable
in whole or in part other than by operation of the stated redemption or
sinking fund provisions under specified unusual or extraordinary
circumstances.  Approximately 99% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Bonds in the Trust is subject to call within one year.


(b)   The ratings shown are those effective at July 31, 1998.


(c)   Insurance has also been obtained by the Bond issuer.


(d)   These Bonds have no stated interest rate ("zero coupon bonds") and,
accordingly, will have no periodic interest payments to the Trust.  Upon
maturity, the holders of these Bonds are entitled to receive 100% of the
stated principal amount.  The Bonds were issued at an original issue
discount on September 15, 1983 at a price of 3.234% of their original
principal amount.


(e)   The Trust consists of four obligations of issuers located in
Pennsylvania.  None of the Bonds in the Trust are general obligations of
a governmental entity.  All issues are revenue bonds payable from the
income of a specific project or authority and are divided by purpose of
issue as follows:  Utilities, 1; Single Family Housing, 1; and
Miscellaneous, 2.  Approximately 68% and 1% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Bonds consist of utility revenue bonds and single family
residential mortgage revenue bonds, respectively.  Each of three Bond
issues represents 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds in the Trust or a total of approximately 99%.  The largest such
issue represents approximately 68%.

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES 7

THE FIRST TRUST OF INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS - MULTI-STATE

PENNSYLVANIA TRUST, SERIES 9




NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1.  Significant accounting policies


Security valuation -


Bonds are stated at values as determined by Securities Evaluation Service,
Inc. (the Evaluator), certain shareholders of which are officers of the
Sponsor.  The bond values are based on (1) current bid prices for the bonds
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to
those held by the Trust, (2) current bid prices for comparable bonds, (3)
appraisal or (4) any combination of the above (see Note 3).


Security cost -


The Trust's cost of its portfolio is based on the offering prices of the bonds
on the Date of Deposit, September 30, 1986.  The premium or discount
(including original issue discount) existing at the Date of Deposit is not
being amortized.  Realized gain (loss) from bond transactions is reported on
an identified cost basis.  Sales and redemptions of bonds are recorded on the
trade date.


Federal income taxes -


The Trust is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes.  Each unit holder is
considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust and,
accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes.






Expenses of the Trust -



In addition to insurance coverage acquired by the Trust (see Note 3), the
Trust pays a fee for Trustee services which is based on $1.05 and $.55 per
$1,000 principal amount of Bonds for those portions of the Trust under
the monthly and semi-annual distribution plans, respectively.  Prior to
September 1, 1995, the Trustee was United States Trust Company of New York;
effective September 1, 1995, The Chase Manhattan Bank succeeded United States
Trust Company of New York as Trustee.  Additionally, a fee of $900 annually is
payable to the Evaluator and the Trust pays all related expenses of the
Trustee and recurring financial reporting costs.


2.  Unrealized appreciation and depreciation


An analysis of net unrealized appreciation at July 31, 1998 follows:








Unrealized appreciation                              $90,889
Unrealized depreciation                                    -
                                                     _______

                                                     $90,889
                                                     =======











3.  Insurance


The Trust has acquired insurance coverage which provides for the scheduled
payments of principal and interest on all bonds in its portfolio and one issue
is also insured by insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds (see Note (c)
to portfolio).  While insurance coverage acquired by an issuer of bonds
continues in force so long as the bonds are outstanding and the insurer
remains in business, insurance coverage acquired by the Trust is effective
only while the bonds are owned by the Trust and, in the event of disposition
of such a bond by the Trustee, the insurance terminates as to such bond on the
date of disposition.  Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of Financial
Guaranty Insurance Company, in the event of a sale of a bond from the
portfolio, the Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance for such
bond upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the
proceeds of the sale of such bond.  Annual insurance premiums payable by the
Trust in future years, assuming no change in the portfolio, would be $225.


The valuation of bonds does not include any amount attributable to the
insurance acquired by the Trust as there has been no default in the payment of
principal or interest on the bonds in the portfolio as of the date of these
financial statements and, in the opinion of the Sponsor, the bonds are being
quoted in the market at a value which does not reflect a significant risk of
such default.


4.  Other information


Cost to investors -


The cost to initial investors of units of the Trust was based on the aggregate
offering price of the bonds on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a
sales charge of 4.8% of the public offering price which is equivalent to
approximately 5.042% of the net amount invested.


Distributions to unit holders -


Distributions of net interest income to unit holders are made monthly or semi-
annually.  Such income distributions per unit, on an accrual basis, were as
follows:








  Type of                                    Year ended July 31,

Part Two                                   ONLY BE USED WITH PART ONE
Dated May 29, 1998                                     AND PART THREE








IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL, INTEREST INCOME TO THE TRUSTS AND TO THE UNIT
HOLDERS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, IS EXEMPT UNDER EXISTING LAW FROM ALL
FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. IN ADDITION, THE INTEREST INCOME TO THE TRUSTS IS,
IN THE OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL, EXEMPT TO THE EXTENT INDICATED FROM
STATE AND LOCAL TAXES WHEN HELD BY RESIDENTS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE
ISSUERS OF THE BONDS IN SUCH TRUSTS ARE LOCATED. CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY,
ARE SUBJECT TO TAX.


THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES (the "Fund") consists of underlying
separate unit investment trusts (the "Trusts"). The various trusts are
collectively referred to herein as the "Trusts" while all Trusts that
are not designated as "The First Trust Advantage" are sometimes
collectively referred to herein as the "Insured Trusts" and a Trust with
the name designation of "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds,
Discount Trust" or "The First Trust Advantage: Discount Trust" is
sometimes referred to herein as a "Discount Trust." Each Trust consists
of a portfolio of interest-bearing obligations, issued by or on behalf
of states and territories of the United States, and political
subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the
opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental
authorities, exempt from all Federal income taxes under existing law
although interest on certain Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas,
Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for
purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax. In addition, the interest
income of each Trust is, in the opinion of Special Counsel, exempt to
the extent indicated from state and local income taxes when held by
residents of the state in which the issuers of the Bonds in such Trust
are located. The securities in a Discount Trust are acquired at prices
which result in a Discount Trust portfolio, as a whole, being purchased
at a deep discount from the aggregate par value of such Securities
although a substantial portion of the Securities in a Discount Trust
portfolio may be acquired at a premium over the par value of such
Securities. All of the Bonds in an Intermediate Trust mature within 8 to
12 years of the Initial Date of Deposit. All of the Bonds in a Short
Intermediate Trust mature within 3 to 6 years of the Initial Date of
Deposit. All of the Bonds in a Long Intermediate Trust mature within 10
to 15 years of the Initial Date of Deposit. The portfolio for each
Trust, essential information based thereon and financial statements,
including a report of independent auditors relating to the series of the
Fund offered hereby, are contained in Part One to which reference should
be made for such information.


INSURANCE GUARANTEEING THE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
ON ALL BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO OF EACH INSURED TRUST HAS BEEN OBTAINED
FROM FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY AND/OR AMBAC INDEMNITY
CORPORATION BY THE INSURED TRUSTS OR WAS DIRECTLY OBTAINED BY THE BOND
ISSUER, THE UNDERWRITERS, THE SPONSOR OR OTHERS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL
DATE OF DEPOSIT FROM FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY, AMBAC
INDEMNITY CORPORATION, OR OTHER INSURERS (THE "PREINSURED BONDS").
INSURANCE OBTAINED BY AN INSURED TRUST APPLIES ONLY WHILE BONDS ARE
RETAINED IN SUCH TRUST, WHILE INSURANCE ON PREINSURED BONDS IS EFFECTIVE
SO LONG AS SUCH BONDS ARE OUTSTANDING. PURSUANT TO AN IRREVOCABLE
COMMITMENT OF FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY, AND/OR AMBAC
INDEMNITY CORPORATION IN THE EVENT OF A SALE OF A BOND INSURED UNDER AN
INSURANCE POLICY OBTAINED BY AN INSURED TRUST, THE TRUSTEE HAS THE RIGHT
TO OBTAIN PERMANENT INSURANCE FOR SUCH BOND UPON THE PAYMENT OF A SINGLE
PREDETERMINED INSURANCE PREMIUM FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF SUCH
BOND. THE INSURANCE, IN EITHER CASE, RELATES ONLY TO THE BONDS IN THE
INSURED TRUSTS AND NOT TO THE UNITS OFFERED HEREBY. AS A RESULT OF SUCH
INSURANCE, THE UNITS OF EACH INSURED TRUST HAVE RECEIVED A RATING OF
"AAA" BY STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS GROUP, A DIVISION OF MCGRAW-HILL,
INC. ("STANDARD & POOR'S"). SEE "WHY AND HOW ARE THE INSURED TRUSTS
INSURED?" ON PAGE 10. NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO ANY INSURER'S
ABILITY TO MEET ITS COMMITMENTS.



ALL PARTS OF THE PROSPECTUS SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.



THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY
OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.


Page 1


For convenience the Prospectus is divided into sections which give
general information about the Fund and specific information such as the
public offering price, distributions and tax status for each Trust.


The Objectives of the Fund are conservation of capital through
investment in portfolios of tax-exempt bonds and income exempt from
Federal and applicable state and local income taxes although interest on
certain Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and
Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for purposes of the Federal
Alternative Minimum Tax. ACCORDINGLY, CERTAIN ARKANSAS, IDAHO, KANSAS,

MAINE, MISSISSIPPI AND NEBRASKA TRUSTS MAY BE APPROPRIATE ONLY FOR
INVESTORS WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX. CERTAIN
BONDS IN THE OKLAHOMA TRUSTS ARE SUBJECT TO OKLAHOMA STATE INCOME TAXES.
The payment of interest and the preservation of principal are, of
course, dependent upon the continuing ability of the issuers, obligors
and/or insurers to meet their respective obligations.


Distributions to Unit holders may be reinvested as described herein. See
"Rights of Unit Holders-How Can Distributions to Unit Holders be
Reinvested?"


The Sponsor, although not obligated to do so, intends to maintain a
market for the Units at prices based upon the aggregate bid price of the
Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust. In the absence of such a market, a
Unit holder will nonetheless be able to dispose of the Units through
redemption at prices based upon the bid prices of the underlying Bonds.
See "Rights of Unit Holders-How May Units be Redeemed?" With respect to
each Insured Trust, neither the bid nor offering prices of the
underlying Bonds or of the Units, absent situations in which Bonds are
in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of
such default, include value attributable to the portfolio insurance
obtained by such Trust. See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?"

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES




What is The First Trust Combined Series?



The First Trust Combined Series (the "Fund") is one of a series of
investment companies created by the Sponsor under the name of The First
Trust Combined Series, all of which are generally similar but each of
which is separate and is designated by a different series number. This
Series consists of underlying separate unit investment trusts (such
Trusts being collectively referred to herein as the "Fund"). Each Series
was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust
Agreement (the "Indenture"), dated the Initial Date of Deposit, with
Nike Securities L.P., as Sponsor, The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee,
Securities Evaluation Service, Inc., as Evaluator and First Trust
Advisors L.P., as Portfolio Supervisor. Only Units of a National Trust
may be offered for sale to residents of the State of Illinois. Only
Units of an Indiana Trust and/or a National Trust may be offered for
sale to residents of the State of Indiana. Only Units of a Virginia
Trust and/or a National Trust may be offered for sale to residents of
the State of Virginia. Only Units of a Washington Trust and/or a
National Trust may be offered for sale to residents of Washington. On
the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee
interest-bearing obligations, including delivery statements relating to
contracts for the purchase of certain such obligations and irrevocable
letters of credit issued by a financial institution in the amounts
required for such purchases (the "Bonds"). The Trustee thereafter
credited the account of the Sponsor for Units of each Trust representing
the entire ownership of the Fund which Units are being offered hereby.


The objectives of the Fund are Federal tax-exempt income and state and
local tax-exempt income and conservation of capital through investment
in portfolios of interest-bearing obligations issued by or on behalf of
the state for which such Trust is named (collectively, the "State
Trusts"), and counties, municipalities, authorities and political
subdivisions thereof, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other
territories or municipalities of the United States, or authorities or
political subdivisions thereof, the interest on which obligations is, in
the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental
authorities, exempt from all Federal income tax and, where applicable,
state and local taxes under existing law although interest on certain
Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and
Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for purposes of the
Alternative Minimum Tax and certain Bonds in the Oklahoma Trusts are
subject to Oklahoma State Income Taxes. The current market value of
certain of the obligations in a Discount Trust were significantly below
face value when the obligations were acquired by such Trust. The prices
at which the obligations are acquired result in a Discount Trust's
portfolio, as a whole, being purchased at a deep discount from the
aggregate par value of such Securities although a substantial portion of
the Securities in a Discount Trust portfolio may be acquired at a
premium over the par value of such Securities. Insurance guaranteeing
the scheduled payment of all principal and interest on Bonds in the
Trusts with the name designation of "The First Trust of Insured
Municipal Bonds," "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-
Intermediate" or "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-Multi-
State" (the "Insured Trusts") has been obtained by such Trusts from
Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("Financial Guaranty") and/or AMBAC
Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity") or was obtained directly by
the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others prior to the
Initial Date of Deposit from Financial Guaranty, AMBAC Indemnity, or
other insurers (the "Preinsured Bonds"). NO PORTFOLIO INSURANCE POLICY
HAS BEEN OBTAINED BY THE TRUSTS WITH THE NAME DESIGNATION OF "THE FIRST
TRUST ADVANTAGE" (THE "ADVANTAGE TRUSTS").  The portfolio insurance
obtained by the Insured Trusts is effective only while the Bonds thus
insured are held in such Trusts, while insurance on Preinsured Bonds is
effective so long as such Bonds are outstanding. See "Why and How are
the Insured Trusts Insured?" THERE IS, OF COURSE, NO GUARANTEE THAT THE

FUND'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACHIEVED. AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND SHOULD BE
MADE WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS WHICH AN INVESTMENT IN FIXED
RATE LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS MAY ENTAIL, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT THE
VALUE OF THE UNITS WILL DECLINE WITH INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES.


Neither the Public Offering Price of the Units of an Insured Trust nor
any evaluation of such Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions
reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by such Trust
unless Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in
significant risk of such default. See "Public Offering-How is the Public
Offering Price Determined?" On the other hand, the value of insurance


Page 3


obtained by the Bond issuer, the Sponsor or others is reflected and
included in the market value of such Bonds.


Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust or by the Bond issuer, the
Sponsor or others is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer,
but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security
therefor. If an issue is accepted for insurance, a noncancelable policy
for the scheduled payment of interest and principal on the Bonds is
issued by the insurer. A single premium is paid by the Bond issuer, the
underwriters, the Sponsor or others for Preinsured Bonds and a monthly
premium is paid by each Insured Trust for the insurance obtained by such
Trust except for Bonds in such Trust which are insured by the Bond
issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others in which case no
premiums for insurance are paid by such Trust. Upon the sale of a Bond
insured under the insurance policy obtained by an Insured Trust, the
Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from Financial
Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity with respect to such Bond upon the
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of
the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in an Insured Trust of the
Fund is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. Standard & Poor's and
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. have rated the claims-paying ability of
Financial Guaranty and AMBAC Indemnity "AAA" and "Aaa," respectively.
See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?"


In selecting Bonds, the following facts, among others, were considered:

(i) the Standard & Poor's rating or Fitch Investors Service, Inc.'s
rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "BBB" in the case of an
Insured Trust (or an Arkansas, Kansas or Maine Advantage Trust) and "A-"
in the case of other Advantage Trusts, or the Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "Baa" in the case of
an Insured Trust (or an Arkansas, Kansas or Maine Advantage Trust) and
"A" in the case of other Advantage Trusts, including provisional or
conditional ratings, respectively, or, if not rated, the Bonds had, in
the opinion of the Sponsor, credit characteristics sufficiently similar
to the credit characteristics of interest-bearing tax-exempt obligations
that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the Fund (see
"Description of Bond Ratings"); (ii) the prices of the Bonds relative to
other bonds of comparable quality and maturity; (iii) with respect to
the Insured Trusts, the availability and cost of insurance of the
principal and interest on the Bonds and (iv) the diversification of
Bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer. Subsequent to the
Initial Date of Deposit, a Bond may cease to be rated or its rating may
be reduced below the minimum required as of the Initial Date of Deposit.
Neither event requires elimination of such Bond from the portfolio, but
may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to
direct the Trustee to dispose of the Bond. See "Rights of Unit Holders-
How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?" The Portfolio appearing in Part
One contains Bond ratings, when available, for the Bonds listed at the
date shown.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may have been acquired at a market
discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on the
discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
Trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued
bonds of comparable rating and type. The market discount of previously
issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued
comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall,
other things being equal. A discount bond held to maturity will have a
larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and
capital gain and less in the form of tax-exempt interest income than a
comparable bond newly issued at current market rates. See "What is the
Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?" appearing in Part Three for each
Trust.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be original issue discount bonds.
Under current law, the original issue discount, which is the difference
between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of
the Bonds, is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion
is treated as tax-exempt interest income for Federal income tax
purposes. On sale or redemption, any gain realized that is in excess of
the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital
gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case
the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income. See
"What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?" appearing in Part
Three for each Trust. The current value of an original discount bond
reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity.
The market value tends to increase in greater increments as the Bonds
approach maturity.


Certain of the original issue discount bonds may be Zero Coupon Bonds
(including bonds known as multiplier bonds, money multiplier bonds,


Page 4


capital appreciation bonds, capital accumulator bonds, compound interest
bonds and money discount maturity payment bonds). Zero Coupon Bonds do
not provide for the payment of any current interest and generally
provide for payment at maturity at face value unless sooner sold or
redeemed. Zero Coupon bond features include (1) not paying interest on a
semi-annual basis and (2) providing for the reinvestment of the bond's
semi-annual earnings at the bond's stated yield to maturity. While Zero
Coupon Bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate
of return minimizes reinvestment risk, this benefit can be negated in
large part by weak call protection.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may have been acquired at a market
premium from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on the
premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
Trusts were higher than the current market interest rates for newly
issued bonds of comparable rating and type. The current returns of bonds
trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current
returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently
prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in
market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes
payable. Because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at
maturity but through current income payments, early redemption of a
premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a
reduction in yield. Redemptions are more likely to occur at times when
the Bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium
over par, or for original issue discount Bonds, a premium over the
accreted value. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in the Fund
at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will
represent a loss of capital when compared to the original Public
Offering Price of the Units. Because premium bonds generally pay a
higher rate of interest than bonds priced at or below par, the effect of
the redemption of premium bonds would be to reduce Estimated Net Annual
Unit Income by a greater percentage than the par amount of such bonds
bears to the total par amount of Bonds in the Trust. Although the actual
impact of any such redemptions that may occur will depend upon the
specific Bonds that are redeemed, it can be anticipated that the
Estimated Net Annual Unit Income will be significantly reduced after the
dates on which such Bonds are eligible for redemption. The Trust may be
required to sell Zero Coupon Bonds prior to maturity (at their current
market price which is likely to be less than their par value) in order
to pay expenses of the Trust or in case the Trust is terminated. See
"Rights of Unit Holders-How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?" and
"Other Information-How May the Indenture be Amended or Terminated?"


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be general obligations of a
governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity.
All other Bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income
of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's
power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are secured by the
issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of
principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable
only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of
facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax
or other specific revenue source. There are, of course, variations in
the security of the different Bonds in the Fund, both within a
particular classification and between classifications, depending on
numerous factors.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be healthcare revenue bonds.
Healthcare revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are
primarily derived from services provided by hospitals or other
healthcare facilities, including nursing homes. A healthcare issuer's
ability to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent
on various factors, including occupancy levels of the facility, demand,
government regulations, wages of employees, overhead expenses,
competition from other similar providers, malpractice insurance costs
and the degree of governmental competition from other similar providers,
malpractice insurance costs and the degree of governmental financial
assistance, including Medicare and Medicaid and other similar third-
party payer programs.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be housing revenue bonds. Housing
revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily
derived from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing
projects for low to moderate income families. Housing revenue bonds are
generally payable at any time and therefore their average life will
ordinarily be less than their stated maturities. The ability of such
issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent
on various factors, including occupancy levels, rental income, mortgage
default rates, taxes, operating expenses, governmental regulations and
the appropriation of subsidies.


Page 5


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers whose
revenues are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services.
Water and sewerage bonds are generally payable from user fees. Problems
faced by such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate
rate increases, population decline resulting in decreased user fees, the
difficulty of financing large construction programs, the limitations on
operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental
considerations, the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering
new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation programs and the
impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers whose
revenues are primarily derived from the sale of electric energy.
Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, among other things, establish the rates which may be
charged and the appropriate rate of return. The problems faced by such
issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and
adequate rate increases from the governing public utility commission,
the difficulty in financing large construction programs, increased
federal, state and municipal government regulations, the limitations on
operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental
considerations, increased competition, recent reductions in estimates of
future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country, the
difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt, the
difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of
energy conservation.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be lease obligations issued
primarily by governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other
means of directly raising revenues. Rather, the governmental authorities
are financing vehicles created solely for the construction of buildings

(i.e., schools, administrative offices, convention centers and prisons)

or the purchase of equipment (i.e., police cars and computer systems)
that will be used by a state or local government (the "lessee"). These
obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee
government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service
on the obligations. Lease obligations are subject, in almost all cases,
to annual appropriation risk, i.e., the lessee government is not legally
obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the
current fiscal year, or construction and abatement risk-rental
obligations cease in the event that delays in building, damage,
destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the
lessee.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be industrial revenue bonds
("IRBs"), tax-exempt securities issued by states, municipalities, public
authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring,
constructing or improving various industrial projects. Debt service
payments on IRBs are dependent on various factors, including the
creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and, if
applicable, corporate guarantor, revenues generated from the project
and, if applicable, corporate guarantor, revenues generated from the
project and regulatory and environmental restrictions.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations which are payable
from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of
facilities such as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities,
convention centers and arenas. The ability of issuers to make debt
service payments on airport obligations is dependent on the capability
of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other
factors, many airlines may have difficulty meeting their obligations
under these use agreements. Similarly, payment on Bonds related to other
facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects, such as user fees
from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings.
Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues
due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance, decreased use of a
facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, scarcity of
fuel and reduction or loss of rents.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers which
govern the operation of schools, colleges and universities and whose
revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes. General problems
relating to college and university obligations would include the
prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of
"college" age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees
sufficiently to cover increased operating costs, the uncertainty of
continued receipt of Federal grants and state funding and new government
legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or
costs of such issuers.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations which are payable
from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource
recovery facilities. Resource recovery facilities are designed to


Page 6


process solid waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity.
Resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional
redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances,
including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation of a project;
contracts relating to a project becoming void, unenforceable or
impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of raw
materials, operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation
of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely
affecting the operation of a project; administrative or judicial actions
which render contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or
impossible to perform; or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive
liabilities.


Certain Trusts may contain Bonds of issuers located in the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico or issuers which will be affected by general economic
conditions of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's unemployment rate remains
significantly higher than the U.S. unemployment rate. Furthermore, the
economy is largely dependent for its development upon U.S. policies and
programs that are being reviewed and may be eliminated.


The economy of Puerto Rico is closely integrated with that of the
mainland United States. During fiscal 1996 approximately 88% of Puerto
Rico's exports were to the U.S. mainland, which was also the source of
approximately 62% of Puerto Rico's imports. The economy of Puerto Rico
is dominated by the manufacturing and service sectors. The manufacturing
sector has experienced fundamental changes over the years as a result of
increased emphasis on higher wage, high technology industries such as
pharmaceuticals, electronics, computers, microprocessors, professional
and scientific instruments, and certain high technology machinery and
equipment. The service sector, including finance, insurance and real
estate, also plays a major role in the economy. It ranks second only to
manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic product and leads
all sectors in providing employment. In recent years, the service sector
has experienced significant growth in response to the expansion of the
manufacturing sector.


The Puerto Rican economy is affected by a number of Commonwealth and
federal investment incentive programs. Aid for Puerto Rico's economy has
traditionally depended heavily on federal programs, and current federal
budgetary policies suggest that an expansion of aid to Puerto Rico is
unlikely. An adverse effect on the Puerto Rican economy could result
from other U.S. policies, including further reduction in transfer
payment programs such as food stamps, curtailment of military spending
and policies which could lead to a stronger dollar. One of the factors
assisting the development of the Puerto Rican economy has been the tax
incentives offered by the federal and Puerto Rico governments.


Puerto Rico's future will be determined by the leadership and
initiatives of both the private and public sector to compensate for the
loss of the federal tax credit under Section 936 of the U.S. tax code.
This important credit which enabled companies to repatriate profits at a
40-60% reduction in federal taxes was terminated as of July 1996.
Existing U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico were given a ten year
grace period, but new U.S. manufacturing companies coming to Puerto Rico
will have to pay U.S. deferral taxes when repatriating their profits to
the mainland.


The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of
the financial difficulties which may impact certain issuers of Bonds and
does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all
adverse conditions to which the issuers of the Bonds are subject.
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control
of the issuers of Bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on
the financial condition of Puerto Rico and various agencies and
political subdivisions located in Puerto Rico. The Sponsor is unable to
predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may
affect the issuers of Bonds, the market value or marketability of the
Bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of the Bonds acquired by
the Trusts to pay interest on or principal of the Bonds.


Interest on certain of the Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas,
Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts will be an item of tax preference
for purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT"). The investment by
non-AMT individual taxpayers in AMT municipal bonds generally results in
a higher yield to such bondholders than non-AMT municipal bonds. Since a
portion of the interest from certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine,
Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts is an AMT preference item, certain
Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts may be
more appropriate for investors who are not subject to AMT.


Investors should be aware that many of the Bonds in the Trusts are
subject to continuing requirements such as the actual use of Bond


Page 7


proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed from Bond
proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on such Bonds from
Federal income taxation. Although at the time of issuance of each of the
Bonds in the Trusts an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the
exemption of interest on such obligations from Federal income taxation,
there can be no assurance that the respective issuers or other obligors
on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements
established upon issuance of the Bonds. A failure to comply with such
requirements may cause a determination that interest on such obligations
is subject to Federal income taxation, perhaps even retroactively from
the date of issuance of such Bonds, thereby reducing the value of the
Bonds and subjecting Unit holders to unanticipated tax liabilities.


Because certain of the Bonds may from time to time under certain
circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with
their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be
distributed to Unit holders and will not be reinvested, no assurance can
be given that a Trust will retain for any length of time its present
size and composition. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be
liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any Bond.
Certain of the Bonds contained in the Trusts may be subject to being
called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities
pursuant to optional redemption provisions, sinking fund provisions,
special or extraordinary redemption provisions or otherwise. A bond
subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or
refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A bond subject
to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from
time to time at par or, in the case of a zero coupon bond, at the
accreted value from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a
portion of an issue prior to maturity. Special or extraordinary
redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par (or for original
issue discount bonds at issue price plus the amount of original issue
discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some premium)
of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances. The exercise of redemption or call provisions will
(except to the extent the proceeds of the called Bonds are used to pay
for Unit redemptions) result in the distribution of principal and may
result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest
distributions; it may also affect the long-term return and the current
return on Units of each Trust. Redemption pursuant to call provisions is
more likely to occur, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions
may occur, when the Bonds have an offering side valuation which
represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a
premium over the accreted value. Unit holders may recognize capital gain
or loss upon any redemption or call.


Like other investment companies, financial and business organizations
and individuals around the world, the Fund could be adversely affected
if the computer systems used by the Sponsor, Evaluator, Portfolio
Supervisor or Trustee or other service providers to the Fund do not
properly process and calculate date-related information and data
involving dates of January 1, 2000 and thereafter. This is commonly
known as the "Year 2000 Problem." The Sponsor, Evaluator, Portfolio
Supervisor and Trustee are taking steps that they believe are reasonably
designed to address the Year 2000 Problem with respect to computer
systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that
comparable steps are being taken by the Fund's other service providers.
At this time, however, there can be no assurance that these steps will
be sufficient to avoid any adverse impact to the Fund. The Sponsor is
unable to predict what impact, if any, the Year 2000 Problem will have
on issuers of the Bonds contained in the Fund.


To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending as
of the date hereof in respect of any Bonds which might reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Trusts. At any time
after the date hereof, litigation may be initiated on a variety of
grounds with respect to Bonds in a Trust. Such litigation, as for
example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue
bonds under recently-enacted environmental protection statutes, may
affect the validity of such Bonds or the tax-free nature of the interest
thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be
entirely predicted, the Fund has received opinions of bond counsel to
the issuing authority of each Bond on the date of issuance to the effect
that such Bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon
is exempt from Federal income taxes and state and local taxes. In
addition, other factors may arise from time to time which potentially
may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with
respect to the Bonds.

What are Estimated Long-Term Return and Estimated Current Return?



At the date of this Prospectus, the Estimated Current Return and the
Estimated Long-Term Return, under the monthly, quarterly (if applicable)
and semi-annual (if applicable) distribution plans, are as set forth in
Part One attached hereto for each Trust. Estimated Current Return is
computed by dividing the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit
by the Public Offering Price. Any change in either amount will result in
a change in the Estimated Current Return. For each Trust, the Public
Offering Price will vary in accordance with fluctuations in the prices
of the underlying Bonds and the Net Annual Interest Income per Unit will
change as Bonds are redeemed, paid, sold or exchanged in certain
refundings or as the expenses of each Trust change. Therefore, there is
no assurance that the Estimated Current Return indicated in Part One for
each Trust will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is
calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and
determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values,
yields (which take into account the amortization of premiums and the
accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of all of the Bonds in
the Trust and (2) takes into account a compounding factor, the expenses
and sales charge associated with each Unit of a Trust. Since the market
values and estimated retirements of the Bonds and the expenses of the
Trust will change, there is no assurance that the Estimated Long-Term
Return indicated in Part One for each Trust will be realized in the
future. Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are
expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return
reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while
Estimated Current Return calculations include only Net Annual Interest
Income and Public Offering Price. Neither rate reflects the true return
to Unit holders, which is lower, because neither includes the effect of
certain delays in distributions to Unit holders.


A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current
returns and estimated long-term returns with the returns on various
taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment
decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales
materials compare the then current estimated returns on the Trust and
returns over specified periods on other similar Trusts sponsored by Nike
Securities L.P. with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or
U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and money market accounts or money
market funds, each of which has investment characteristics that may
differ from those of the Trust.



How are Purchased Interest and Accrued Interest Treated?



Purchased Interest. For The First Trust Combined Series 198-208, each
Trust contains an amount of Purchased Interest. Purchased Interest is a
portion of the unpaid interest that has accrued on the Bonds from the
later of the last payment date on the Bonds or the date of issuance
thereof through the First Settlement Date and is included in the
calculation of the Public Offering Price. Purchased Interest will be
distributed to Unit holders as Units are redeemed or Securities are
sold, mature or are called. See "Summary of Essential Information"
appearing in Part One for each Trust for the amount of Purchased
Interest per Unit for each Trust. Purchased Interest is an element of
the determination of the price Unit holders will receive in connection
with the sale or redemption of Units prior to the termination of the
Trust.


Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid
interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid.
Interest on Bonds generally is paid semi-annually, although each Trust
accrues such interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an
amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this
reason, with respect to sales settling subsequent to the First
Settlement Date, the Public Offering Price of Units will have added to
it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of
settlement. Unit holders will receive on the next distribution date of
the Trust the amount, if any, of accrued interest paid on their Units.


For The First Trust Combined Series 1-197, except through an advancement
of its own funds, the Trustee has no cash for distribution to Unit
holders until it receives interest payments on the Bonds in a Trust. The
Trustee will recover its advancements without interest or other costs to
such Trust from interest received on the Bonds in the Trust. When these
advancements have been recovered, regular distributions of interest to
Unit holders will commence. See "Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest
and Principal Distributed?" Interest account balances are established
with generally positive cash balances so that it will not be necessary
on a regular basis for the Trustee to advance its own funds in
connection with interest distributions.


Page 9


For The First Trust Combined Series 198-208, in an effort to reduce the
amount of Purchased Interest which would otherwise have to be paid by
Unit holders, the Trustee may advance a portion of the accrued interest
to the Sponsor as the Unit holder of record as of the First Settlement
Date. Consequently, the amount of accrued interest to be added to the
Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued interest from
the First Settlement Date to the date of settlement (other than the
Purchased Interest already included therein), less any distributions
from the Interest Account subsequent to the First Settlement Date. See
"Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest and Principal Distributed?"


For The First Trust Combined Series 209 and subsequent Series, in an
effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise
have to be paid in addition to the Public Offering Price in the sale of
Units to the public, the Trustee will advance the amount of accrued
interest as of the First Settlement Date and the same will be
distributed to the Sponsor as the Unit holder of record as of the First
Settlement Date. Consequently, the amount of accrued interest to be
added to the Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued
interest from the First Settlement Date to the date of settlement, less
any distributions from the Interest Account subsequent to the First
Settlement Date. See "Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest and
Principal Distributed?"


Because of the varying interest payment dates of the Bonds, accrued
interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of
interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unit holders.
If a Unit holder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he will
be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the Purchased Interest
(if any) and accrued interest from the purchaser of his Units. Since the
Trustee has the use of the funds (including Purchased Interest, if any)
held in the Interest Account for distributions to Unit holders and since
such Account is non-interest-bearing to Unit holders, the Trustee
benefits thereby.



Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?



THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO THE INSURED TRUSTS. THE
BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO OF AN ADVANTAGE TRUST ARE NOT INSURED BY
INSURANCE OBTAINED BY THE FUND.


All Bonds in the portfolio of an Insured Trust are insured as to the
scheduled payment of interest and principal by policies obtained by each
Insured Trust from Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("Financial
Guaranty" or "FGIC"), a New York stock insurance company, or AMBAC
Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity" or "AMBAC"), a Wisconsin-
domiciled stock insurance company, or obtained by the Bond issuer, the
underwriters, the Sponsor or others prior to the Initial Date of Deposit
directly from Financial Guaranty, AMBAC Indemnity or other insurers (the
"Preinsured Bonds"). The insurance policy obtained by each Insured Trust
is noncancellable and will continue in force for such Trust so long as
such Trust is in existence and the Bonds described in the policy
continue to be held by such Trust (see "Portfolio" for each Insured
Trust). Nonpayment of premiums on the policy obtained by each Insured
Trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance, but will permit
Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity to take action against the
Trustee to recover premium payments due it. Premium rates for each issue
of Bonds protected by the policy obtained by each Insured Trust are
fixed for the life of such Trust. The premium for any Preinsured Bonds
has been paid in advance by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the
Sponsor or others and any such policy or policies are noncancellable and
will continue in force so long as the Bonds so insured are outstanding
and the insurer and/or insurers thereof remain in business. If the
provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its
obligations under such policy, or if the rating assigned to the claims-
paying ability of such insurer deteriorates, Financial Guaranty and/or
AMBAC Indemnity has no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected
by either of the above described events. A monthly premium is paid by
each Insured Trust for the insurance obtained by such Trust, which is
payable from the interest income received by such Trust. In the case of
Preinsured Bonds, no premiums for insurance are paid by the Insured Trust.


Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. Under the provisions of the
aforementioned portfolio insurance issued by Financial Guaranty,
Financial Guaranty unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to
Citibank, N.A., or its successor, as its agent (the "Fiscal Agent"),
that portion of the principal of and interest on the Bonds covered by
the policy which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by
reason of nonpayment by the issuer of the Bonds. The term "due for
payment" means, when referring to the principal of a Bond, its stated
maturity date or the date on which it shall have been called for
mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to any earlier date
on which payment is due by reason of call for redemption (other than by


Page 10


mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration or other advancement of
maturity and means, when referring to interest on a Bond, the stated
date for payment of interest, except that when the interest on a Bond
shall have been determined, as provided in the underlying documentation
relating to such Bond, to be subject to Federal income taxation, "due
for payment" also means, when referring to the principal of such Bond,
the date on which such Bond has been called for mandatory redemption as
a result of such determination of taxability, and when referring to
interest on such Bond, the accrued interest at the rate provided in such
documentation to the date on which such Bond has been called for such
mandatory redemption, together with any applicable redemption premium.
The term "due for payment" will not include, when referring to either
the principal of a Bond or the interest on a Bond, any acceleration of
payment unless such acceleration is at the sole option of Financial
Guaranty.


Financial Guaranty will make such payments to the Fiscal Agent on the
date such principal or interest becomes due for payment or on the
business day next following the day on which Financial Guaranty shall
have received notice of nonpayment, whichever is later. The Fiscal Agent
will disburse to the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest
which is then due for payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by
the issuer but only upon receipt by the Fiscal Agent of (i) evidence of
the Trustee's right to receive payment of the principal or interest due
for payment and (ii) evidence, including any appropriate instruments of
assignment, that all of the rights to payment of such principal or
interest due for payment shall thereupon vest in Financial Guaranty.
Upon such disbursement, Financial Guaranty shall become the owner of the
Bond, appurtenant coupon or right to payment of principal or interest on
such Bond and shall be fully subrogated to all of the Trustee's rights
thereunder, including the right to payment thereof.


Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of Financial Guaranty, the
Trustee, upon the sale of a Bond covered under a policy obtained by an
Insured Trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect
to such Bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the Bonds regardless of the
identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of
the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in an Insured Trust is
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee
will exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such
exercise the Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of Bond
proceeds less the insurance premium attributable to the Permanent
Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such Bonds
were sold on an uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to
each Bond eligible for Permanent Insurance is determined based upon the
insurability of each Bond as of the Initial Date of Deposit and will not
be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of such
Bond.


Financial Guaranty is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FGIC Corporation (the
"Corporation"), a Delaware holding company. The Corporation is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of General Electric Capital Corporation ("GECC").
Neither the Corporation nor GECC is obligated to pay the debts of or the
claims against Financial Guaranty. Financial Guaranty is a monoline
financial guarantee insurer domiciled in the State of New York and is
subject to regulation by the State of New York Insurance Department. As
of December 31, 1997, the total capital and surplus of Financial
Guaranty was approximately $1,225,590,411. Copies of Financial
Guaranty's financial statements, prepared on the basis of statutory
accounting principles, and the Corporation's financial statements,
prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, may
be obtained by writing to Financial Guaranty at 115 Broadway, New York,
New York 10006, Attention: Communications Department (telephone number

Beaver Street, New York, New York 10004-2319, Attention: Financial
Condition Property/Casualty Bureau (telephone number (212) 480-5187).


In addition, Financial Guaranty is currently licensed to write insurance

The information relating to Financial Guaranty contained above has been
furnished by such corporation. The financial information contained
herein with respect to such corporation is unaudited but appears in
reports or other materials filed with state insurance regulatory
authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No
representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such
information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such
information subsequent to the date thereof.


AMBAC Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity"). The Insurance Policy of
AMBAC Indemnity obtained by an Insured Trust is noncancellable and will


Page 11


continue in force for so long as the Bonds described in the Insurance
Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by an
Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will
pay, when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the
insurance premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with AMBAC Indemnity,
in the event of a sale of a Bond covered by the AMBAC Indemnity
Insurance Policy, the Trustee has the right to obtain permanent
insurance for such Bond upon payment of a single predetermined premium
from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond.


Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, AMBAC Indemnity agrees to pay
to the Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the
Bonds insured by AMBAC Indemnity which shall become due for payment but
shall be unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer of the Bonds. The
term "due for payment" means, when referring to the principal of a Bond
so insured, its stated maturity date or the date on which it shall have
been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to
any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call for
redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption),
acceleration or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring
to interest on a Bond, the stated date for payment of interest.


AMBAC Indemnity will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty
days after notice from the Trustee is received by AMBAC Indemnity that a
nonpayment of principal or of interest on a Bond has occurred, but not
earlier than the date on which the Bonds are due for payment. AMBAC
Indemnity will disburse to the Trustee the face amount of principal and
interest which is then due for payment but is unpaid by reason of
nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for delivery of Bonds, not less in
face amount than the amount of the payment in bearer form, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In cases where
Bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to
registered holders or their assigns, AMBAC Indemnity shall pay principal
only upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid Bonds uncancelled and
free of any adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in
satisfactory form, so as to permit ownership of such Bonds to be
registered in the name of AMBAC Indemnity or its nominee. In cases where
Bonds are issuable only in a form whereby interest is payable to
registered holders or their assigns, AMBAC Indemnity shall pay interest
only upon presentation of proof that the claimant is the person entitled
to the payment of interest on the Bonds and delivery of an instrument of
assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to AMBAC Indemnity all
right under such Bonds to receive the interest in respect of which the
insurance payment was made.


AMBAC Indemnity is a Wisconsin-domiciled stock insurance corporation
regulated by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of
Wisconsin and licensed to do business in fifty states, the District of
Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, with admitted assets of
approximately $2,967,246,831 (unaudited) and statutory capital of
approximately $1,715,481,691 (unaudited) as of March 31, 1998. Statutory
capital consists of AMBAC Indemnity's policyholders' surplus and
statutory contingency reserve. AMBAC Indemnity is a wholly owned
subsidiary of AMBAC Inc., a 100% publicly-held company. Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's have both assigned a
triple-A claims-paying ability rating to AMBAC Indemnity.


On December 18, 1997, all of the outstanding shares of Construction Loan
Insurance Corporation (which previously owned all of the outstanding
shares of Connie Lee Insurance Company) were merged into Connie Lee
Holdings, Inc. ("Connie Lee"). Connie Lee is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of AMBAC Assurance Company, a Wisconsin-domiciled insurance company.


Copies of AMBAC Indemnity's financial statements prepared in accordance
with statutory accounting standards are available from AMBAC Indemnity.
The address of AMBAC Indemnity's administrative offices and its
telephone number are One State Street Plaza, 17th Floor, New York, New
York 10004 and (212) 668-0340.


The information relating to AMBAC Indemnity contained above has been
furnished by AMBAC Indemnity. No representation is made herein as to the
accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any
adverse changes in such information, subsequent to the date hereof.


In determining whether to insure bonds, Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC
Indemnity has applied its own standards which are not necessarily the
same as the criteria used in regard to the selection of bonds by the
Sponsor. This decision is made prior to the Initial Date of Deposit, as
bonds not covered by such insurance are not deposited in an Insured
Trust, unless such bonds are Preinsured Bonds. The insurance obtained by


Page 12


an Insured Trust covers Bonds deposited in such Trust and physically
delivered to the Trustee in the case of bearer bonds or registered in
the name of the Trustee or its nominee or delivered along with an
assignment in the case of registered bonds or registered in the name of
the Trustee or its nominee in the case of Bonds held in book-entry form.
Contracts to purchase Bonds are not covered by the insurance obtained by
an Insured Trust although Bonds underlying such contracts are covered by
insurance upon physical delivery to the Trustee.


Insurance obtained by each Insured Trust or by the Bond issuer, the
underwriters, the Sponsor or others does not guarantee the market value
of the Bonds or the value of the Units of such Trust. The insurance
obtained by an Insured Trust is effective only as to Bonds owned by and
held in such Trust. In the event of a sale of any such Bond by the
Trustee, the insurance terminates as to such Bond on the date of sale.
In the event of a sale of a Bond insured by an Insured Trust, the
Trustee has the right to obtain Permanent Insurance upon the payment of
an insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond. Except
as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no effect
on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention
of the Evaluator to attribute a value to such insurance obtained by an
Insured Trust (including the right to obtain Permanent Insurance) for
the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of Units only if
the Bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of
principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant risk
of such default. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of a Bond which is in default in
payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default
assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less
the insurance premium attributable to the purchase of Permanent
Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such Bonds not covered by
Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering-How is the Public Offering
Price Determined?" herein for a more complete description of the
Evaluator's method of valuing defaulted Bonds and Bonds which have a
significant risk of default. Insurance on a Preinsured Bond is effective
as long as such Bond is outstanding. Therefore, any such insurance may
be considered to represent an element of market value in regard to the
Bonds thus insured, but the exact effect, if any, of this insurance on
such market value cannot be predicted.


A contract of insurance obtained by an Insured Trust and the
negotiations in respect thereof represent the only relationship between
Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity and the Fund. Otherwise
neither Financial Guaranty nor its parent, FGIC Corporation, or any
affiliate thereof, nor AMBAC Indemnity nor its parent, AMBAC, Inc., or
any affiliate thereof has any significant relationship, direct or
indirect, with the Fund or the Sponsor, except that the Sponsor has in
the past and may from time to time in the future, in the normal course
of its business, participate as sole underwriter or as manager or as a
member of underwriting syndicates in the distribution of new issues of
municipal bonds in which the investors or the affiliates of FGIC
Corporation and/or AMBAC Inc. have or will be participants or for which
a policy of insurance guaranteeing the scheduled payment of interest and
principal has been obtained from Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC
Indemnity. Neither the Fund nor the Units of a Trust nor the portfolio
of such Trust is insured directly or indirectly by FGIC Corporation
and/or AMBAC Inc.

Financial Security Assurance. Financial Security Assurance Inc.
("Financial Security") is a monoline insurance company incorporated in
1984 under the laws of the State of New York. Financial Security is
licensed to engage in the financial guaranty insurance business in all
50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.


Financial Security and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of
writing financial guaranty insurance, principally in respect of
securities offered in domestic and foreign markets. In general,
financial guaranty insurance consists of the issuance of a guaranty of
scheduled payments of an issuer's securities, thereby enhancing the
credit rating of those securities, in consideration for payment of a
premium to the insurer. Financial Security and its subsidiaries
principally insure asset-backed, collateralized and municipal
securities. Asset-backed securities are generally supported by
residential mortgage loans, consumer or trade receivables, securities or
other assets having an ascertainable cash flow or market value.
Collateralized securities include public utility first mortgage bonds
and sale/leaseback obligation bonds. Municipal securities consist
largely of general obligation bonds, special revenue bonds and other
special obligations of state and local governments. Financial Security
insures both newly issued securities sold in the primary market and
outstanding securities sold in the secondary market that satisfy
Financial Security's underwriting criteria.


Financial Security is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security
Assurance Holdings Ltd. ("Holdings"), a New York Stock Exchange listed
company. Major shareholders of Holdings include Fund American
Enterprises Holdings, Inc., U S West Capital Corporation and The Tokio
Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. No shareholder of Financial Security
is obligated to pay any debt of Financial Security or its subsidiaries
or any claim under any insurance policy issued by Financial Security or
its subsidiaries or to make any additional contribution to the capital
of Financial Security or its subsidiaries. As of March 31, 1998, the
total policyholders' surplus and contingency reserves and the total
unearned premium reserve, respectively, of Financial Security and its
consolidated subsidiaries were, in accordance with statutory accounting
principles, approximately $808,603,000 (unaudited) and $503,683,000
(unaudited), and the total shareholders' equity and the unearned premium
reserve, respectively, of Financial Security and its consolidated

Pursuant to an intercompany agreement, liabilities on financial guaranty
insurance written or reinsured from third parties by Financial Security
or any of its domestic operating insurance company subsidiaries
(including FSA Maryland) are reinsured among such companies on an agreed-
upon percentage substantially proportional to their respective capital,
surplus and reserves, subject to applicable statutory risk limitations.
In addition, Financial Security and FSA Maryland reinsure a portion of
their liabilities under certain of their financial guaranty insurance
policies with other reinsurers under various quota share treaties and on
a transaction-by-transaction basis. Such reinsurance is utilized as a
risk management device and to comply with certain statutory and rating
agency requirements; it does not alter or limit the obligations of
Financial Security or FSA Maryland under any financial guaranty
insurance policy.


The claims-paying ability of Financial Security and FSA Maryland is
rated "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and "AAA" by Standard &
Poor's Rating Services, Nippon Investors Service Inc. and Standard &
Poor's (Australia) Pty. Ltd. Such ratings reflect only the views of the
respective rating agencies, are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold
securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by such
rating agencies.


Connie Lee Insurance Company. On December 18, 1997, all of the
outstanding shares of Construction Loan Insurance Corporation (which
previously owned all of the outstanding shares of Connie Lee Insurance
Company) were merged into Connie Lee Holdings, Inc. ("Connie Lee").
Connie Lee is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMBAC Assurance Company, a
Wisconsin-domiciled insurance company.


As of December 31, 1997, the total policyholders' surplus of Connie Lee
was $92,563,017 (unaudited) and total admitted assets were $233,237,273
(unaudited), as reported to the Commissioner of Insurance of the State
of Wisconsin in Connie Lee's financial statements prepared in accordance
with statutory accounting principles applicable to insurance companies.
Copies of these financial statements are available from Connie Lee upon
request.


CCLIA's consolidated annual (audited) and quarterly (unaudited)
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles are filed periodically with the Nationally
Recognized Municipal Securities Information Repositories designated
under Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
information contained in these financial statements is incorporated
herein by reference. Copies of these financial statements are available
from Connie Lee upon request.


Standard & Poor's has rated the claims-paying ability of Connie Lee "AAA".


Connie Lee makes no representation regarding the Bonds or the
advisability of investing in the Bonds. The above rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Connie Lee insured Bonds and
such rating is subject to the revision or withdrawal at any time by the
rating agency. Any downward revision or withdrawal of the rating may
have an adverse effect on the market price of the Connie Lee insured
Bonds.

Because the Bonds in each Insured Trust are insured as to the scheduled
payment of principal and interest and on the basis of the financial
condition of the insurance companies referred to above, Standard &
Poor's has assigned to units of each Insured Trust its "AAA" investment
rating. This is the highest rating assigned to securities by Standard &
Poor's. See "Description of Bond Ratings." The obtaining of this rating
by each Insured Trust should not be construed as an approval of the
offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's or as a guarantee of the
market value of each Insured Trust or the Units of such Trust. Standard
& Poor's has indicated that this rating is not a recommendation to buy,
hold or sell Units nor does it take into account the extent to which
expenses of each Trust or sales by each Trust of Bonds for less than the
purchase price paid by such Trust will reduce payment to Unit holders of
the interest and principal required to be paid on such Bonds. Such
rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the
Initial Date of Deposit of an Insured Trust and will, unless renewed,
terminate at the end of such period. There is no guarantee that the
"AAA" investment rating with respect to the Units of an Insured Trust
will be maintained.


An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by such Insured Trust is to
obtain a higher yield on the Bonds in the portfolio of such Trust than


Page 15


would be available if all the Bonds in such portfolio had the Standard &
Poor's "AAA" and/or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. "Aaa" rating(s) and
at the same time to have the protection of insurance of scheduled
payment of interest and principal on the Bonds. There is, of course, no
certainty that this result will be achieved. Bonds in a Trust for which
insurance has been obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the
Sponsor or others (all of which were rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's
and/or "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.) may or may not have a
higher yield than uninsured bonds rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's or
"Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. In selecting Bonds for the
portfolio of each Insured Trust, the Sponsor has applied the criteria
herein before described.



What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?

FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO EXEMPTION FROM STATE OR OTHER LOCAL
TAXES, SEE PART THREE FOR EACH TRUST.







What are the Expenses and Charges?



With the exception of bookkeeping and other administrative services
provided to the Trusts, for which the Sponsor will be reimbursed in
amounts as set forth under "Special Trust Information" in each Part One
of this Prospectus, the Sponsor will not receive any fee in connection
with its activities relating to the Trusts. For Series 49 and all
subsequent Series, First Trust Advisors L.P., an affiliate of the
Sponsor, will receive an annual supervisory fee, which is not to exceed
the amount set forth in Part One for each Trust, for providing portfolio
supervisory services for the Trust. Such fee is based on the number of
Units outstanding in each Trust on January 1 of each year except for
Trusts which were established subsequent to the last January 1, in which
case the fee will be based on the number of Units outstanding in such
Trusts as of the respective Initial Dates of Deposit.


For each valuation of the Bonds in a Trust, the Evaluator will receive a
fee as indicated in Part One of this Prospectus. The Trustee pays
certain expenses of each Trust for which it is reimbursed by such Trust.


The Trustee will receive for its ordinary recurring services to a Trust
an annual fee computed as indicated in Part One of this Prospectus. For
a discussion of the services performed by the Trustee pursuant to its
obligations under the Indenture, reference is made to the material set
forth under "Rights of Unit Holders."


The Trustee's and Evaluator's fees are payable monthly on or before each
Distribution Date from the Interest Account of each Trust to the extent
funds are available and then from the Principal Account of such Trust.
Since the Trustee has the use of the funds being held in the Principal
and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses and
redemptions and since such Accounts are non-interest-bearing to Unit
holders, the Trustee benefits thereby. Part of the Trustee's
compensation for its services to the Fund is expected to result from the
use of these funds. However, the Trustee may bear from its own resources
certain expenses relating to a Trust.


Each of the above mentioned fees may be increased without approval of
the Unit holders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under
the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price
Index published by the United States Department of Labor. In addition,
with respect to the fees payable to the Sponsor or an affiliate of the
Sponsor for providing bookkeeping and other administrative services and
supervisory services, such individual fees may exceed the actual costs
of providing such services for a Trust, but at no time will the total
amount received for such Services rendered to all unit investment trusts
of which Nike Securities L.P. is the Sponsor in any calendar year exceed
the actual cost to the Sponsor or its affiliate of supplying such
services in such year.


The annualized cost of the portfolio insurance obtained by the Fund for
each Insured Trust is indicated in Part One for each Trust in a Series
of the Fund. The portfolio insurance continues so long as such Trust
retains the Bonds thus insured. Premiums are payable monthly in advance
by the Trustee on behalf of such Trust. As Bonds in the portfolio are
redeemed by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the
amount of premium will be reduced in respect of those Bonds no longer
owned by and held in the Trust which were insured by insurance obtained
by such Trust. Preinsured Bonds for which insurance has been obtained


Page 16


from Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity or, beginning with Series
25 and all subsequent Series, other insurers, are not insured by such
Trust. The premium payable for Permanent Insurance will be paid solely
from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond in the event the Trustee
exercises the right to obtain Permanent Insurance on a Bond. The
premiums for such Permanent Insurance with respect to each Bond will
decline over the life of the Bond. An Advantage Trust is not insured;
accordingly, there are no premiums for insurance payable by such Trust.


The following additional charges are or may be incurred by a Trust: all
expenses (including legal and annual auditing expenses) of the Trustee
incurred in connection with its responsibilities under the Indenture,
except in the event of negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on
its part; the expenses and costs of any action undertaken by the Trustee
to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of the Unit holders;
fees of the Trustee for any extraordinary services performed under the
Indenture; indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or
expense incurred by it without negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with its
acceptance or administration of the Trust; indemnification of the
Sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as Depositor of
the Trust; all taxes and other government charges imposed upon the Bonds
or any part of the Trust (no such taxes or charges are being levied or
made or, to the knowledge of the Sponsor, are contemplated); and
expenditures incurred in contacting Unit holders upon termination of the
Trust. The above expenses and the Trustee's annual fee, when paid or
owing to the Trustee, are secured by a lien on the Trust. In addition,
the Trustee is empowered to sell Bonds of a Trust in order to make funds
available to pay all these amounts if funds are not otherwise available
in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the Trust.


Unless the Sponsor determines that such an audit is not required, the
Indenture requires the accounts of each Trust to be audited on an annual
basis at the expense of the Trust by independent auditors selected by
the Sponsor. So long as the Sponsor is making a secondary market for
Units, the Sponsor shall bear the cost of such annual audits to the
extent such cost exceeds $.50 per Unit. Unit holders of a Trust covered
by an audit may obtain a copy of the audited financial statements from
the Trustee upon request.



PUBLIC OFFERING




How is the Public Offering Price Determined?



Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to maintain a
market for the Units and continuously to offer to purchase Units at
prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid
price of the Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust plus the amount of
Purchased Interest of a Trust (if any) and interest accrued to the date
of settlement. All expenses incurred in maintaining a market, other than
the fees of the Evaluator and the costs of the Trustee in transferring
and recording the ownership of Units, will be borne by the Sponsor. If
the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for some other business reason,
the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. IF A UNIT
HOLDER WISHES TO DISPOSE OF HIS UNITS, HE SHOULD INQUIRE OF THE SPONSOR
AS TO CURRENT MARKET PRICES PRIOR TO MAKING A TENDER FOR REDEMPTION TO
THE TRUSTEE. Prospectuses relating to certain other bond funds indicate
an intention, subject to change, on the part of the respective sponsors
of such funds to repurchase units of those funds on the basis of a price
higher than the bid prices of the securities in the funds. Consequently,
depending upon the prices actually paid, the repurchase price of other
sponsors for units of their funds may be computed on a somewhat more
favorable basis than the repurchase price offered by the Sponsor for
Units of a Trust in secondary market transactions. As in the First Trust
Combined Series, the purchase price per unit of such bond funds will
depend primarily on the value of the securities in the Portfolio of the
applicable Trust.


The Public Offering Price of Units of a Trust will be determined by
adding to the Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of
the Bonds in a Trust plus the amount of Purchased Interest of a Trust
(if any) and the appropriate sales charge determined in accordance with
the schedule set forth below, based upon the number of years remaining
to the maturity of each Bond in the portfolio of the Trust, adjusting
the total to reflect the amount of any cash held in or advanced to the
principal account of the Trust and dividing the result by the number of
Units of such trust then outstanding. The minimum sales charge on Units


Page 17


will be 3% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to 3.093% of the net
amount invested). For purposes of computation, Bonds will be deemed to
mature on their expressed maturity dates unless: (a) the Bonds have been
called for redemption or funds or securities have been placed in escrow
to redeem them on an earlier call date, in which case such call date
will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature; or (b) such Bonds
are subject to a "mandatory tender," in which case such mandatory tender
will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature. The offering price
of Bonds in the Trust may be expected to be greater than the bid price
of such Bonds by approximately 1-2% of the aggregate principal amount of
such Bonds.


The effect of this method of sales charge computation will be that
different sales charge rates will be applied to each of the various
Bonds in the Trusts based upon the maturities of such bonds, in
accordance with the following schedule:








                             Secondary Offering Period Sales Charge
                             Percentage                  Percentage
                             of Public                   of Net
                             Offering                    Amount
Years to Maturity            Price                       Invested
__________________           ___________                 _________
0 Months to 1 Year           1.00%                       1.010%

2 but less than 3            2.00                        2.041
3 but less than 4            2.50                        2.564

7 but less than 8            4.50                        4.712
8 but less than 9            5.00                        5.263
9 but less than 10           5.50                        5.820
10 or more                   5.80                        6.157








There will be no reduction of the sales charges for volume purchases. A
dealer will receive from the Sponsor a dealer concession of 70% of the
total sales charges for Units sold by such dealer and dealers will not
be eligible for additional concessions for Units sold pursuant to the
above schedule.


An investor may aggregate purchases of Units of two or more consecutive
series of a particular State, National, Discount, Intermediate, Long
Intermediate or Short Intermediate Trust for purposes of calculating the
discount for volume purchases listed above. Additionally, with respect
to the employees, officers and directors (including their immediate
family members, defined as spouses, children, grandchildren, parents,
grandparents, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, sons-in-law and daughters-
in-law, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such
person) of the Sponsor and broker/dealers and their subsidiaries and
vendors providing services to the Sponsor, may purchase Units of the
Trusts during the secondary market at the Public Offering Price less the
concession the Sponsor typically allows broker/dealers.


Any such reduced sales charge shall be the responsibility of the selling
broker/dealer. The reduced sales charge structure will apply on all
purchases of Units in a Trust by the same person on any one day from the
Sponsor or any one broker/dealer and, for purposes of calculating the
applicable sales charge, purchases of Units in the Fund will be
aggregated with concurrent purchases by the same person from the Sponsor
or such broker/dealer of Units in any series of tax-exempt unit
investment trusts sponsored by Nike Securities L.P. Additionally, Units
purchased in the name of the spouse of a purchaser or in the name of a
child of such purchaser will be deemed, for the purpose of calculating
the applicable sales charge, to be additional purchases by the
purchaser. The reduced sales charges will also be applicable to a
trustee or other fiduciary purchasing securities for a single trust
estate or single fiduciary account.


From time to time the Sponsor may implement programs under which
broker/dealers and other selling agents of the Fund may receive nominal
awards from the Sponsor for each of their registered representatives who
have sold a minimum number of UIT Units during a specified time period.
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs
under which the sales force of broker/dealers and other selling agents
may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts,
or under which the Sponsor will reallow to any such broker/dealer or
other selling agent that sponsors sales contests or recognition programs
conforming to criteria established by the Sponsor, or participates in


Page 18


sales programs sponsored by the Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the
total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such person at
the public offering price during such programs. Also, the Sponsor in its
discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria
established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying broker/dealers and
other selling agents for certain services or activities which are
primarily intended to result in sales of Units of the Trusts. Such
payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and not out of
the assets of the Trusts. These programs will not change the price Unit
holders pay for their Units or the amount that the Trusts will receive
from the Units sold.


A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current
returns and estimated long-term returns with the returns on various
taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment
decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales
materials compare the then current estimated returns on the Trust and
returns over specified periods on other similar Trusts sponsored by Nike
Securities L.P. with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or
U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and money market accounts or money
market funds, each of which has investment characteristics that may
differ from those of the Trust. U.S. Government bonds, for example, are
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government and bank CDs
and money market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal
government. Money market accounts and money market funds provide
stability of principal, but pay interest at rates that vary with the
condition of the short-term debt market. The investment characteristics
of the Trust are described more fully elsewhere in this Prospectus.


The aggregate price of the Bonds in each Trust is determined by the
evaluator (the "Evaluator"), on the basis of bid prices (1) on the basis
of current market prices for the Bonds obtained from dealers or brokers
who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the Trust; (2)
if such prices are not available for any of the Bonds, on the basis of
current market prices for comparable bonds; (3) by determining the value
of the Bonds by appraisal; or (4) by any combination of the above.
Unless Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or, in
the Sponsor's opinion, in significant risk of such default, the
Evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an
Insured Trust. On the other hand, the value of insurance obtained by the
issuer of Bonds in a Trust is reflected and included in the market value
of such Bonds.


The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of Bonds which are in
default in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's
opinion, in significant risk of such default (the "Defaulted Bonds") and
which are covered by insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, the value
of the insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments. The value
of the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market
value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain
Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premium attributable to the
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such
Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In addition, the
Evaluator will consider the ability of Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC
Indemnity to meet its commitments under an Insured Trust's insurance
policy, including the commitments to issue Permanent Insurance. It is
the position of the Sponsor that this is a fair method of valuing the
Bonds and the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust and reflects a
proper valuation method in accordance with the provisions of the
Investment Company Act of 1940.


The Evaluator will be requested to make a determination of the aggregate
price of the Bonds in each Trust, on a bid price basis, as of the close
of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day on which it is
open, effective for all sales, purchases or redemptions made subsequent
to the last preceding determination.


Although payment is normally made three business days following the
order for purchase, payment may be made prior thereto. A person will
become owner of the Units on the date of settlement provided payment has
been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to the
date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the
Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor,
subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Delivery of Certificates representing Units so ordered will be made
three business days following such order or shortly thereafter. See
"Rights of Unit Holders-How May Units Be Redeemed?" for information
regarding the ability to redeem Units ordered for purchase.


Page 19



How are Units Distributed?



Units repurchased in the secondary market (see "Public Offering-Will
There be a Secondary Market?") may be offered by this Prospectus at the
secondary market public offering price determined in the manner
described above.


It is the intention of the Sponsor to qualify Units of the Fund for sale
in a number of states. Sales will be made to dealers and others at
prices which represent a concession or agency commission of 4.0% of the
Public Offering Price per Unit for each State, Discount or National
Trust, 3.0% of the Public Offering Price for an Intermediate or Long
Intermediate Trust, and 2.5% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for a
Short Intermediate Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, broker/dealers
or other selling agents who purchase, in the aggregate, $250,000 of the
Trusts on any day will receive a volume concession or agency commission
of $40.00 per Unit. However, resales of Units of a Trust by such
broker/dealers and other selling agents to the public will be made at
the Public Offering Price described in this Prospectus. The Sponsor
reserves the right to change the amount of the concession or agency
commission from time to time. Certain commercial banks are making Units
of the Fund available to their customers on an agency basis. A portion
of the sales charge paid by these customers is retained by or remitted
to the banks in the amounts indicated in the amounts indicated above.
Under the Glass-Steagall Act, banks are prohibited from underwriting
Units; however, the Glass-Steagall Act does permit certain agency
transactions and the banking regulators have not indicated that these
particular agency transactions are not permitted under such Act. In
Texas and in certain other states, any banks making Units available must
be registered as broker/dealers under state law.



What are the Sponsor's Profits?



The Sponsor and participating dealers will receive a maximum gross sales
commission equal to 5.8% of the Public Offering Price of the Units of
each State Trust (equivalent to 6.157% of the net amount invested), 5.8%
of the Public Offering Price of the Units of a National or Discount
Trust (equivalent to 6.157% of the net amount invested), 4.7% of the
Public Offering Price of the Units of an Intermediate or Long
Intermediate Trust (equivalent to 4.932% of the net amount invested),
and 3.7% of the Public Offering Price of the Units of a Short
Intermediate Trust (equivalent to 3.842% of the net amount invested)
less any reduced sales charge for quantity purchases as described under
"Public Offering-How is the Public Offering Price Determined?"


In maintaining a market for the Units, the Sponsor will also realize
profits or sustain losses in the amount of any difference between the
price at which Units are purchased (based on the bid prices of the Bonds
in each Trust) and the price at which Units are resold (which price is
also based on the bid prices of the Bonds in each Trust and includes a
maximum sales charge of 5.8% for a State Trust, 5.8% for a National or
Discount Trust, 4.7% for an Intermediate or Long Intermediate Trust and
3.7% for a Short Intermediate Trust) or redeemed. The secondary market
public offering price of Units may be greater or less than the cost of
such Units to the Sponsor.



RIGHTS OF UNIT HOLDERS




How are Certificates Issued and Transferred?



The Trustee is authorized to treat as the record owner of Units that
person who is registered as such owner on the books of the Trustee.
Ownership of Units is evidenced by registered certificates executed by
the Trustee and the Sponsor. Delivery of certificates representing Units
ordered for purchase is normally made three business days following such
order or shortly thereafter. Certificates are transferable by
presentation and surrender to the Trustee properly endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer.
Certificates to be redeemed must be properly endorsed or accompanied by
a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unit holder must sign
exactly as his name appears on the face of the certificate with the
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in
addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the
Trustee. In certain instances the Trustee may require additional
documents such as, but not limited to, trust instruments, certificates
of death, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates of
corporate authority. Record ownership may occur before settlement.


Page 20


Certificates will be issued in fully registered form, transferable only
on the books of the Trustee in denominations of one Unit or any multiple
thereof, numbered serially for purposes of identification. Certificates
for Units will bear an appropriate notation on their face indicating
which plan of distribution has been selected in respect thereof. When a
change is made, the existing certificate must be surrendered to the
Trustee and a new certificate issued to reflect the then currently
effective plan of distribution. There is no charge for this service.


Although no such charge is now made or contemplated, a Unit holder may
be required to pay $2.00 to the Trustee per certificate reissued or
transferred for reasons other than to change the plan of distribution,
and to pay any governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with each such transfer or exchange. For new certificates issued to
replace destroyed, stolen or lost certificates, the Unit holder may be
required to furnish indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee and pay such
expenses as the Trustee may incur. Mutilated certificates must be
surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.



How are Interest and Principal Distributed?



Record Dates for the distribution of interest under the semi-annual
distribution plan are the fifteenth day of June and December with the
Distribution Dates being the last day of the month in which the related
Record Date occurs. It is anticipated that an amount equal to
approximately one-half of the amount of net annual interest income per
Unit will be distributed on or shortly after each Distribution Date to
Unit holders of record on the preceding Record Date. Record Dates for
monthly distributions of interest are the fifteenth day of each month.
The Distribution Dates for distributions of interest under the monthly
plan is the last day of each month in which the related Record Date
occurs. See "Special Trust Information" appearing in each Part I of this
Prospectus.


The plan of distribution selected by a Unit holder will remain in effect
until changed. Unit holders purchasing Units in the secondary market
will initially receive distributions in accordance with the election of
the prior owner. Each year, approximately six weeks prior to the end of
May, the Trustee will furnish each Unit holder a card to be returned to
the Trustee not more than thirty nor less than ten days before the end
of such month. Unit holders desiring to change the plan of distribution
in which they are participating may so indicate on the card and return
same, together with their certificate, to the Trustee. If the card and
certificate are returned to the Trustee, the change will become
effective as of June 16 of that year. If the card and certificate are
not returned to the Trustee, the Unit holder will be deemed to have
elected to continue with the same plan for the following twelve months.


The pro rata share of cash in the Principal Account of each Trust will
be computed as of the fifteenth day of each month, and distributions to
the Unit holders of such Trust as of such Record Date will be made on
the dates specified in Part One. Proceeds from the disposition of any of
the Bonds of such Trust (less any premiums due with respect to Bonds for
which the Trustee has exercised the right to obtain Permanent Insurance)
received after such Record Date and prior to the following Distribution
Date will be held in the Principal Account of such Trust and not
distributed until the next Distribution Date. The Trustee is not
required to make a distribution from the Principal Account of a Trust
unless the amount available for distribution shall equal at least $1.00
per Unit.


The Trustee will credit to the Interest Account of each Trust all
interest received by such Trust, including that part of the proceeds
(including insurance proceeds if any, paid to an Insured Trust) of any
disposition of Bonds which represents accrued interest. Other receipts
will be credited to the Principal Account of such Trust. The
distribution to the Unit holders of a Trust as of each Record Date will
be made on the following Distribution Date or shortly thereafter and
shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of the
holder's pro rata share of the estimated annual income of such Trust
after deducting estimated expenses. Except through an advancement of its
own Funds, the Trustee has no cash for distribution to Unit holders
until it receives interest payments on the Bonds in a Trust. The Trustee
shall be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from funds
in the Interest Account of such Trust on the ensuing Record Date.
Persons who purchase Units between a Record Date and a Distribution Date
will receive their first distribution on the second Distribution Date
after the purchase, under the applicable plan of distribution. The
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal
or Interest Account of a Trust (but may itself earn interest thereon and
therefore benefit from the use of such funds).


Page 21


As of the fifteenth day of each month, the Trustee will deduct from the
Interest Account of each Trust and, to the extent funds are not
sufficient therein, from the Principal Account of each Trust, amounts
necessary to pay the expenses of such Trust. The Trustee also may
withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary
to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the
Trust. Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of the
Trust's assets until such time as the Trustee shall return all or any
part of such amounts to the appropriate account. In addition, the
Trustee may withdraw from the Interest Account and the Principal Account
of a Trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemption of Units
of such Trust by the Trustee.



How Can Distributions to Unit Holders be Reinvested?



Universal Distribution Option. Unit holders may elect participation in a
Universal Distribution Option which permits a Unit holder to direct the
Trustee to distribute principal and interest payments to any other
investment vehicle of which the Unit holder has an existing account. For
example, at a Unit holder's direction, the Trustee would distribute
automatically on the applicable distribution date interest income or
principal on the participant's Units to, among other investment
vehicles, a Unit holder's checking, bank savings, money market,
insurance, reinvestment or any other account. All such distributions, of
course, are subject to the minimum investment and sales charges, if any,
of the particular investment vehicle to which distributions are
directed. The Trustee will notify the participant of each distribution
pursuant to the Universal Distribution Option. The Trustee will
distribute directly to the Unit holder any distributions which are not
accepted by the specified investment vehicle. A participant may at any
time, by so notifying the Trustee in writing, elect to terminate his
participation in the Universal Distribution Option and receive directly
future distributions on his Units.


Distribution Reinvestment Option. The Sponsor has entered into an
arrangement with Oppenheimer Management Corporation, which permits any
Unit holder of a Trust to elect to have each distribution of interest
income or principal on his Units automatically reinvested in shares of
either the Oppenheimer Intermediate Tax-Exempt Bond Fund (the
"Intermediate Series") or the Oppenheimer Insured Tax-Exempt Bond Fund
(the "Insured Series"). Oppenheimer Management Corporation is the
investment adviser of each Series which are open-end, diversified
management investment companies. The investment objective of the
Intermediate Series is to provide a high level of current interest
income exempt from Federal income tax through the purchase of investment
grade securities. The investment objective of the Insured Series is to
provide as high a level of current interest income exempt from Federal
income tax as is consistent with the assurance of the scheduled receipt
of interest and principal through insurance and the preservation of
capital (the income of either Series may constitute an item of
preference for determining the Federal alternative minimum tax). The
objectives and policies of each Series are presented in more detail in
the prospectus for each Series.


Each person who purchases Units of a Trust may contact the Trustee to
request a prospectus describing each Series and a form by which such
person may elect to become a participant in a Distribution Reinvestment
Option with respect to a Series. Each distribution of interest income or
principal on the participant's Units will automatically be applied by
the Trustee to purchase shares (or fractions thereof) of a Series
without a sales charge and with no minimum investment requirements.


The shareholder service agent for each Series will mail to each
participant in the Distribution Reinvestment Option confirmations of all
transactions undertaken for such participant in connection with the
receipt of distributions from The First Trust Combined Series and the
purchase of shares (or fractions thereof) of a Series.


A participant may at any time, by so notifying the Trustee in writing,
elect to terminate his participation in the Distribution Reinvestment
Option and receive future distributions on his Units in cash. There will
be no charge or other penalty for such termination. The Sponsor and
Oppenheimer Management Corporation each have the right to terminate the
Distribution Reinvestment Option, in whole or in part.


It should be remembered that even if distributions are reinvested
through the Universal Distribution Option or the Distribution
Reinvestment Option they are still treated as distributions for income
tax purposes.

What Reports Will Unit Holders Receive?



The Trustee shall furnish Unit holders of each Trust in connection with
each distribution a statement of the amount of interest, if any, and the
amount of other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed
in each case as a dollar amount per Unit. Within a reasonable time after
the last business day of each calendar year, the Trustee will furnish to
each person who at any time during the calendar year was a Unit holder
of a Trust of record, a statement as to (1) the Interest Account:

interest received by such Trust (including amounts representing interest
received upon any disposition of Bonds of such Trust), the amount of
such interest representing insurance proceeds (if applicable),
deductions for payment of applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of
the Trust, redemption of Units and the balance remaining after such
distributions and deductions, expressed both as a total dollar amount
and as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit
outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year; (2) the
Principal Account: the dates of disposition of any Bonds of such Trust
and the net proceeds received therefrom (excluding any portion
representing interest and the premium attributable to the exercise of
the right, if applicable, to obtain Permanent Insurance), deduction for
payment of applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of the Trust,
redemptions of Units, and the balance remaining after such distributions
and deductions, expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar
amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding on the
last business day of such calendar year; (3) the Bonds held and the
number of Units of such Trust outstanding on the last business day of
such calendar year; (4) the Redemption Price per Unit based upon the
last computation thereof made during such calendar year; and (5) the
amounts actually distributed during such calendar year from the Interest
Account and from the Principal Account of such Trust, separately stated,
expressed both as total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per Unit
outstanding on the Record Date for such distributions.


In order to comply with Federal and state tax reporting requirements,
Unit holders will be furnished, upon request to the Trustee, evaluations
of the Bonds in their Trust furnished to it by the Evaluator.


Each distribution statement will reflect pertinent information in
respect of each plan of distribution so that Unit holders may be
informed regarding the results of the other plan or plans of distribution.



How May Units be Redeemed?



A Unit holder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by tender to the
Trustee at its unit investment trust office in the City of New York of
the certificates representing the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or
accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with signature guaranteed
as explained above (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, as in
connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates), and payment of
applicable governmental charges, if any. No redemption fee will be
charged. On the third day following such tender, the Unit holder will be
entitled to receive in cash an amount for each Unit equal to the
Redemption Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of
such tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on
which Units are received by the Trustee (if such day is a day on which
the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading), except that as regards
Units received after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange
(generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a
day on which the New York Stock Exchange is scheduled in advance to
close at such earlier time), the date of tender is the next day on which
such Exchange is open for trading and such Units will be deemed to have
been tendered to the Trustee on such day for redemption at the
redemption price computed on that day. Units so redeemed shall be
cancelled.


Purchased Interest (if any) and other accrued interest to the settlement
date paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account of
a Trust or, if the balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal
Account of such Trust. All other amounts paid on redemption shall be
withdrawn from the Principal Account of the Trust.


The Redemption Price per Unit will be determined on the basis of the bid
price of the Bonds in a Trust and the amount of Purchased Interest of
the Trust (if any), as of the close of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange on the date any such determination is made. The Redemption Price
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit determined by the Trustee on
the basis of (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or moneys in the process
of being collected, (2) the value of the Bonds in such Trust based on
the bid prices of the Bonds, except for those cases in which the value
of the insurance, if applicable, has been added, and (3) Purchased


Page 23


Interest (if any) and any other interest accrued thereon, less (a)
amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of
such Trust, (b) the accrued expenses of such Trust, and (c) cash held
for distribution to Unit holders of record as of a date prior to the
evaluation then being made. The Evaluator may determine the value of the
Bonds in a Trust (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the Bonds
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds
comparable to those held by such Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices
for bonds comparable to any Bonds for which bid prices are not
available, (3) by determining the value of the Bonds by appraisal, or

(4) by any combination of the above. In determining the Redemption Price
per Unit for an Insured Trust, no value will be attributed to the
portfolio insurance covering the Bonds in such Trust unless such Bonds
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant
risk of such default. On the other hand, Bonds insured under a policy
obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others are
entitled to the benefits of such insurance at all times and such
benefits are reflected and included in the market value of such Bonds.
See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?" For a description of
the situations in which the evaluator may value the insurance obtained
by an Insured Trust, see "Public Offering-How is the Public Offering
Price Determined?"


The difference between the bid and offering prices of such Bonds may be
expected to average 1-2% of the principal amount. In the case of
actively traded bonds, the difference may be as little as 1/2 of 1% and,
in the case of inactively traded bonds, such difference usually will not
exceed 3%. Therefore, the price at which Units may be redeemed could be
less than the price paid by the Unit holder and may be less than the par
value of the Securities represented by the Units so redeemed.


The Trustee is empowered to sell underlying Bonds in a Trust in order to
make funds available for redemption. To the extent that Bonds are sold,
the size and diversity of such Trust will be reduced. Such sales may be
required at a time when Bonds would not otherwise be sold and might
result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than
for customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the
Securities and Exchange Commission determines that trading on that
Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of which
disposal or evaluation of the Bonds is not reasonably practicable, or
for such other periods as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by
order permit. Under certain extreme circumstances, the Sponsor may apply
to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an order permitting a full
or partial suspension of the right of Unit holders to redeem their Units.



How May Units be Purchased by the Sponsor?



The Trustee shall notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for
redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the secondary market at that time
equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit, which for certain
Trusts includes Purchased Interest, it may purchase such Units by
notifying the Trustee before 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on the next
succeeding business day and by making payment therefor to the Unit
holder not later than the day on which the Units would otherwise have
been redeemed by the Trustee. Units held by the Sponsor may be tendered
to the Trustee for redemption as any other Units. Any profit or loss
resulting from the resale or redemption of such Units will belong to the
Sponsor.



How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?



The Trustee is empowered to sell such of the Bonds in each Trust on a
list furnished by the Sponsor as the Trustee in its sole discretion may
deem necessary to meet redemption requests or pay expenses to the extent
funds are unavailable. As described in the following paragraph and in
certain other unusual circumstances for which it is determined by the
Depositor to be in the best interests of the Unit holders or if there is
no alternative, the Trustee is empowered to sell Bonds in a Trust which
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant
risk of such default and for which value has been attributed to the
insurance, if any, obtained by the Trust. See "Rights of Unit Holders-
How May Units be Redeemed?" The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated,
to direct the Trustee to dispose of Bonds in a Trust in the event of
advanced refunding. The Sponsor may from time to time act as agent for a
Trust with respect to selling Bonds out of a Trust. From time to time,
the Trustee may retain and pay compensation to the Sponsor subject to
the restrictions under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.


Page 24


If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any Bond
occurs and no provision for payment is made therefor, either pursuant to
the portfolio insurance, if any, or otherwise, within thirty days, the
Trustee is required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails
to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold such Bond within thirty days
after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the
Trustee may, in its discretion, sell the defaulted Bond and not be
liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.


The Sponsor shall instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by an
issuer of any of the Bonds to issue new obligations in exchange and
substitution for any Bonds pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan,
except that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept such an offer
or to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem
proper if the issuer is in default with respect to such Bonds or in the
written opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default in
respect to such Bonds in the foreseeable future. Any obligations so
received in exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject
to the terms and conditions in the Indenture to the same extent as Bonds
originally deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of
obligations in exchange or substitution for underlying Bonds, the
Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each Unit holder of the
affected Trust, identifying the Bonds eliminated and the Bonds
substituted therefor. Except as stated in this paragraph and under "What
is the First Trust Combined Series?" for Failed Bonds, the acquisition
by a Trust of any securities other than the Bonds initially deposited is
prohibited.

The Sponsor and the Trustee shall be under no liability to Unit holders
for taking any action or for refraining from taking any action in good
faith pursuant to the Indenture, or for errors in judgment, but shall be
liable only for their own willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
negligence (ordinary negligence in the case of the Trustee) or reckless

OTHER INFORMATION




How May the Indenture be Amended or Terminated?



The Sponsor and the Trustee have the power to amend the Indenture
without the consent of any of the Unit holders when such an amendment is

(1) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision of
the Indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other
provision contained therein, or (2) to make such other provisions as
shall not adversely affect the interest of the Unit holders (as
determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee), provided that
the Indenture is not amended to increase the number of Units of any
Trust issuable thereunder or to permit the deposit or acquisition of
securities either in addition to or in substitution for any of the Bonds
of any Trust initially deposited in a Trust, except for the substitution
of certain refunding securities for Bonds or New Bonds for Failed Bonds.
In the event of any amendment, the Trustee is obligated to notify
promptly all Unit holders of the substance of such amendment.


Each Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of 100% of the Unit
holders of such Trust or by the Trustee when the value of such Trust, as
shown by any evaluation, is less than 20% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Bonds initially deposited in the Trust or by the Trustee
in the event that Units of a Trust not yet sold aggregating more than
60% of the Units of such Trust are tendered for redemption by the
Underwriters, including the Sponsor. If a Trust is liquidated because of
the redemption of unsold Units of the Trust by the Underwriters, the


Page 26


Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units of such Trust the entire
sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Indenture will terminate upon
the redemption, sale or other disposition of the last Bond held
thereunder, but in no event shall it continue beyond the Mandatory
Termination Date as indicated in Part One for each Trust. In the event
of termination, written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to
all Unit holders of such Trust. Within a reasonable period after
termination, the Trustee will sell any Bonds remaining in the Trust,
and, after paying all expenses and charges incurred by such Trust, will
distribute to each Unit holder of such Trust (including the Sponsor if
it then holds any Units), upon surrender for cancellation of his
Certificate for Units, his pro rata share of the balances remaining in
the Interest and Principal Accounts of such Trust, all as provided in
the Indenture.

DESCRIPTION OF BOND RATINGS*



Standard & Poor's. A brief description of the applicable Standard &
Poor's rating symbols and their meanings follow:


A Standard & Poor's corporate or municipal bond rating is a current
assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a
specific debt obligation. This assessment may take into consideration
obligors such as guarantors, insurers, or lessees.


The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a
security, inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or
suitability for a particular investor.


The ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or
obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers reliable.
Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection with any
rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial information.
The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of
changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or for other
circumstances.


The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following
considerations:


l.   Likelihood of default-capacity and willingness of the obligor as to
the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance
with the terms of the obligation;


ll.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation;


lll. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


AAA-Bonds rated AAA have the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay
principal is extremely strong.**


AA-Bonds rated AA have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay
principal and differ from the highest rated issues only in small degree.


A-Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay
principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds
in higher rated categories.


BBB-Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate
protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing
circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay
interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds
in higher rated categories.


Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by
the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within
the major rating categories.


Provisional Ratings: The letter "p" indicates that the rating is
provisional. A provisional rating assumes the successful completion of
the project being financed by the bonds being rated and indicates that
payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent
upon the successful and timely completion of the project. This rating,
however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the
project, makes no comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default
upon failure of, such completion. The investor should exercise his/her
own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk.


Credit Watch: Credit Watch highlights potential changes in ratings of
bonds and other fixed income securities. It focuses on events and trends
which place companies and government units under special surveillance by
S&P's 180-member analytical staff. These may include mergers, voter
referendums, actions by regulatory authorities, or developments gleaned
from analytical reviews. Unless otherwise noted, a rating decision will
be made within 90 days. Issues appear on Credit Watch where an event,
situation, or deviation from trends occurred and needs to be evaluated
as to its impact on credit ratings. A listing, however, does not mean a
rating change is inevitable. Since S&P continuously monitors all of its
ratings, Credit Watch is not intended to include all issues under
review. Thus, rating changes will occur without issues appearing on
Credit Watch.




*As published by the rating companies.


**Bonds insured by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, AMBAC Indemnity
Corporation, Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, Connie Lee
Insurance Company, Financial Security Assurance and Capital Guaranty
Insurance Company are automatically rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's.


Page 28


Moody's Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings follow:


Aaa-Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They
carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred
to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or by an
exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the various
protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be
visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position
of such issues. Their safety is so absolute that with the occasional
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances, characteristically,
their market value is affected solely by money market fluctuations.


Aa-Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally
known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds
because margins of protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities
or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or
there may be other elements present which make the long term risks
appear somewhat large than in Aaa securities. Their market value is
virtually immune to all but money market influences, with the occasional
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances.


A-Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes
and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors
giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate, but
elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment
sometime in the future. The market value of A-rated bonds may be
influenced to some degree by economic performance during a sustained
period of depressed business conditions, but, during periods of
normalcy, A-rated bonds frequently move in parallel with Aaa and Aa
obligations, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few
specific instances.


A 1 and Baa 1-Bonds which are rated A 1 and Baa 1 offer the maximum in
security within their quality group, can be bought for possible
upgrading in quality, and additionally, afford the investor an
opportunity to gauge more precisely the relative attractiveness of
offerings in the market place.


Baa-Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade
obligations; i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured.
Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present
but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be
characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such bonds
lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative
characteristics as well. The market value of Baa-rated bonds is more
sensitive to changes in economic circumstances, and aside from
occasional speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class, Baa
market valuations will move in parallel with Aaa, Aa, and A obligations
during periods of economic normalcy, except in instances of oversupply.


Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at
the high end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range
ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower
end of its generic rating category.


Con.(---)-Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of
some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally.
These are bonds secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction,

(b) earnings of projects unseasoned in operation experience, (c) rentals
which begin when facilities are completed, or (d) payments to which some
other limiting condition attaches. Parenthetical rating denotes probable
credit stature upon completion of construction or elimination of basis
of condition.


Fitch Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable
Fitch Investors Service, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings follow:


AAA-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit
quality. The obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest
and repay principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably
foreseeable events.


AA-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit
quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is
very strong, although not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA. Bonds
rated in the AAA and AA categories are not significantly vulnerable to
foreseeable future developments.


A-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality.
The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered
to be strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic
conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.


BBB-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit
quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is


Page 29


considered to be adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and
circumstances, however, are more likely to have adverse impact on these
bonds, and therefore impair timely payment. The likelihood that the
ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than
for bonds with higher ratings.


To provide more detailed indications of credit quality, the AA, A and
BBB ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to
show relative standing within these major rating categories.

Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders



At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from
Federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective
issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to State Trusts, where
applicable, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as
to the exemption of interest on such Bonds when held by residents of the
State in which the issuers of such Bonds are located, from State income
taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes.
Neither the Sponsor, Chapman and Cutler, nor any of the Special Counsel
to the Fund for State tax matters have made any special review for the
Fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the
bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith. If the interest
on a Bond should be determined to be taxable, the Bond would generally
have to be sold at a substantial discount. In addition, investors could
be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on
which interest is determined to be taxable.


Gain realized on the sale or redemption of the Bonds by the Trustee or
of a Unit by a Unit holder is includable in gross income for Federal
income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax
purposes. (Such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of
accrued interest or accrued original issue discount, if any.) If a Bond
is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price paid for
the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond. When this
accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of capital and
reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased for a premium,
the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the Bond. Bond
premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond, and the tax
basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium
amortized in that tax year.


For purposes of the following opinions, it is assumed that each asset of
the Trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income
for Federal income tax purposes. At the time of the closing for each
Trust, Chapman and Cutler, Counsel for the Sponsor, rendered an opinion
under then existing law substantially to the effect that:


(1)   the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for
Federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue
discount on Bonds which is excludable from gross income under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") will retain its status for
Federal income tax purposes, when received by the Trusts and distributed
to a Unit holder; however, such interest may be taken into account in
computing the alternative minimum tax and the additional tax on branches
of foreign corporations and the environmental tax (the "Superfund Tax"),
as noted below. See "Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit
Holders";



ALL PARTS OF THE PROSPECTUS SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.



THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY
OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

(2)   each Unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata
portion of each asset of the respective Trust under subpart E,
subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code and will have a taxable event when
the Trust disposes of a Bond, or when the Unit holder redeems or sells
his Units. If the Unit holder disposes of a Unit, he is deemed thereby
to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the
Trust involved including his pro rata portion of all the Bonds
represented by the Unit. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (the "1997
Act") includes provisions that treat certain transactions designed to
reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain (e.g. short
sales, offsetting notional principal contracts, futures or forward
contracts or similar transactions) as constructive sales for purposes of
recognition of gain (but not loss) and for purposes of determining the
holding period. Unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with
regard to any such constructive sale rules. Unit holders must reduce the
tax basis of their Units for their share of accrued interest received by
the respective Trust, if any, on Bonds before the date the Trust
acquired ownership of the Bonds (and the amount of this reduction may
exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller) and,
consequently, such Unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or
reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such Units. Gain or
loss upon the sale or redemption of Units is measured by comparing the
proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the
Units. If the Trustee disposes of Bonds (whether by sale, payment on
maturity, redemption or otherwise), gain or loss is recognized to the
Unit holder (subject to various non-recognition provisions of the Code).
The amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the Unit
holder's pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with
the Unit holder's basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset
disposed of. In the case of a Unit holder who purchases Units, such
basis (before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and
amortized bond premium, if any) is determined by apportioning the cost
of the Units among each of the Trust assets ratably according to value
as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the Units.
Unit holders should consult their own tax advisers with regard to the
calculation of basis. The tax basis reduction requirements of the Code
relating to amortization of bond premium may, under some circumstances,
result in the Unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his Units are
sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost;
and


(3)  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by
issuers of Bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds
held by the Trustee will be excludable from Federal gross income if, and
to the same extent as, such interest would have been so excludable if
paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted Bonds provided
that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such
policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable
expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer, will
pay debt service on the Bonds.


Sections 1288 and 1272 of the Code provide a complex set of rules
governing the accrual of original issue discount. These rules provide
that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant
compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the Bond, depending
on the date the Bond was issued. In addition, special rules apply if the
purchase price of a Bond exceeds the original issue price plus the
amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued
based upon its issue price (its "adjusted issue price") to prior owners.
If a Bond is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price
paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond.
When this accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of
capital and reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased
for a premium, the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of
the Bond. Bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond,
and the tax basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of
the premium amortized in that tax year. The application of these rules
will also vary depending on the value of the Bond on the date a Unit
holder acquires his Unit, and the price the Unit holder pays for his
Unit. Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these
rules and their application. See "Portfolio" appearing in Part One for
each Trust for information relating to Bonds, if any, issued at an
original issue discount.


The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the "Tax Act") subjects tax-
exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the Code effective for
bonds purchased after April 30, 1993. In general, market discount is the
amount (if any) by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds
an investor's purchase price (except to the extent that such difference,


Page 2


if any, is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued),
subject to statutory de minimis rule. Market discount can arise based on
the price a Trust pays for Bonds or the price a Unit holder pays for his
or her Units. Under the Tax Act, accretion of market discount is taxable
as ordinary income; under prior law the accretion had been treated as
capital gain. Market discount that accretes while a Trust holds a Bond
would be recognized as ordinary income by the Unit holders when
principal payments are received on the Bond, upon sale or at redemption
(including early redemption) or upon the sale or redemption of his or
her Units, unless a Unit holder elects to include market discount in
taxable income as it accrues. The market discount rules are complex and
Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and
their application.


Counsel for the Sponsor has also advised that under Section 265 of the
Code, interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or
carry Units of a Trust is not deductible for Federal income tax
purposes. The Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that such
indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying
of Units (however, these rules generally do not apply to interest paid
on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence).
Also, under Section 265 of the Code, certain financial institutions that
acquire Units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest
expense attributable to ownership of Units. Legislative proposals have
been made that would extend the financial institution rules to certain
other corporations including securities dealers and other financial
intermediaries. Investors with questions regarding these issues should
consult with their tax advisers.


In the case of certain of the Bonds in a Trust, the opinions of bond
counsel indicate that interest on such Bonds received by a "substantial
user" of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these Bonds,
or persons related thereto, for periods while such Bonds are held by
such a user or related person, will not be excludable from Federal gross
income, although interest on such Bonds received by others would be
excludable from Federal gross income. "Substantial user" and "related
person" are defined under the Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations. Any
person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related
person as so defined should contact his tax adviser.


ALL STATEMENTS OF LAW IN THE PROSPECTUS CONCERNING EXCLUSION FROM GROSS
INCOME FOR FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER TAX PURPOSES ARE THE OPINIONS OF
COUNSEL AND ARE TO BE SO CONSTRUED.


At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from
Federal gross income are rendered by bond counsel to the respective
issuing authorities. Neither the Sponsor nor Chapman and Cutler has made
any special review for the Fund of the proceedings relating to the
issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for such opinions.


In general, Section 86 of the Code provides that 50% of Social Security
benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of
"modified adjusted gross income" plus 50% of the Social Security
benefits received exceeds the "base amount." The base amount is $25,000
for unmarried taxpayers, $32,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint
return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times
during the taxable year and who file separate returns. Modified adjusted
gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to
certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income
and by including tax-exempt interest. To the extent that Social Security
benefits are includible in gross income, they will be treated as any
other item of gross income.


In addition, under the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after
December 31 1993, up to 85% of Social Security benefits are includible
in gross income to the extent that the sum of "modified adjusted gross
income" plus 50% of Social Security benefits received exceeds an
"adjusted base amount." The adjusted base amount is $34,000 for
unmarried taxpayers, $44,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint
return, and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all
times during the taxable year and who file separate returns.


Although tax-exempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross
income solely for the purpose of determining what portion, if any, of
Social Security benefits will be included in gross income, no tax-exempt
interest, including that received from a Trust, will be subject to tax.
A taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount
or the adjusted base amount must include 50% or 85%, respectively, of
his Social Security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives
any tax-exempt interest. A taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income
(after inclusion of tax-exempt interest) does not exceed the base amount
need not include any Social Security benefits in gross income.


Page 3


For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals
and corporations, interest on certain private activity bonds (which
includes most industrial and housing revenue bonds) issued on or after
August 8, 1986 is included as an item of tax preference. EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE NOTED IN PART ONE FOR CERTAIN TRUSTS, THE TRUSTS DO NOT
INCLUDE ANY SUCH PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS ISSUED ON OR AFTER THAT DATE.


For taxpayers other than corporations, net capital gains (which is
defined as net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss
for the taxable year) are subject to a maximum marginal stated tax rate
of either 28% or 20%, depending upon the holding period of the capital
assets. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the holding period for the
asset is more than one year, and is short-term if the holding period for
the asset is one year or less. Generally, capital gain realized from
assets held for more than one year but not more than 18 months are taxed
at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 28% and capital gains realized
from assets (with certain exclusions) held for more than 18 months are
taxed at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 20% (10% in the case of
certain taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket). Further, capital gains
realized from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same
rate as ordinary income. Legislation is currently pending that provides
the appropriate methodology that should be applied in netting the
realized capital gains and losses. Such legislation is proposed to be
effective retroactively for tax years ending after May 6, 1997. The date
on which a Unit is acquired (i.e., the "trade date") is excluded for
purposes of determining the holding period of the Unit. It should be
noted that legislative proposals are introduced from time to time that
affect tax rates and could affect relative differences at which ordinary
income and capital gains are taxed.


In addition, please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as
ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are
considered "conversion transactions" effective for transactions entered
into after April 30, 1993. Unit holders and prospective investors should
consult with their tax advisers regarding the potential effect of this
provision on their investment in Units.


Under the Code, taxpayers must disclose to the Internal Revenue Service
the amount of tax-exempt interest earned during the year.


Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit Holders. In the case of
certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax and the Superfund Tax
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986 depend upon the
corporation's alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is the
corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the
adjustment items used in computing AMTI of a corporation (other than an
S Corporation, Regulated Investment Company, Real Estate Investment
Trust, or REMIC) is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such
corporation's "adjusted current earnings" over an amount equal to its
AMTI (before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating
loss deduction). "Adjusted current earnings" includes all tax-exempt
interest, including interest on all of the Bonds in the Trusts. Under
current Code provisions, the Superfund Tax does not apply to tax years
beginning on or after January 1, 1996. Legislative proposals have been
introduced that would reinstate the Superfund Tax for taxable years
beginning after December 31, 1997 and before January 1, 2009. Under the
provisions of Section 884 of the Code, a branch profits tax is levied on
the "effectively connected earnings and profits" of certain foreign
corporations which include tax-exempt interest such as interest on the
Bonds in the Trust. Unit holders should consult their tax advisers with
respect to the particular tax consequences to them, including the
corporate alternative minimum tax, the Superfund Tax and the branch
profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the Code.


Ownership of the Units may result in collateral federal income tax
consequences to certain taxpayers, including, without limitation,
corporations, subject to the branch profits tax, financial institutions,
certain insurance companies, certain S corporations, individual
recipients of Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and
taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred (or continued) indebtedness
to purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisers as to the applicability of any such
collateral consequences.


At the time of the closing, Winston & Strawn (previously named Cole &
Deitz), Special Counsel to Series 4-125 of the Fund for New York tax
matters, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax laws of the
State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that each Trust
in Series 4-125 of the Fund is not an association taxable as a
corporation and the income of each Trust in Series 4-125 of the Fund


Page 4


will be treated as the income of the Unit holder in the same manner as
for Federal income tax purposes (subject to differences in accounting
for discount and premium to the extent the State and/or City of New York
do not conform to current Federal law).


At the time of the closing, Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, Special Counsel
to the Fund for New York tax matters for Series 126 and subsequent
Series of the Fund, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax
laws of the State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that
each Trust will not constitute an association taxable as a corporation
under New York law, and accordingly will not be subject to the New York
State franchise tax or the New York City general corporation tax. Under
the income tax laws of the State and City of New York, the income of
each Trust will be considered the income of the holders of the Units.


All statements in the Prospectus concerning exclusion from gross income
for Federal, state or other are the opinions of Counsel and are to be so
construed.



Ohio Tax Status of Unit Holders



Each Ohio Insured Trust is comprised of interest-bearing obligations
issued by or on behalf of the State of Ohio, political subdivisions
thereof, or agencies or instrumentalities thereof ("Ohio Obligations"),
or by the governments of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or Guam
(collectively, "Territorial Obligations"). At the time of the closing
for each Ohio Trust, Special Counsel to the Fund for Ohio tax matters
rendered an opinion under then existing Ohio income tax law applicable
to taxpayers whose income is subject to Ohio income taxation
substantially to the effect that:


Each Ohio Insured Trust is not taxable as a corporation or otherwise for
purposes of the Ohio personal income tax, Ohio school district income
taxes, the Ohio corporation franchise tax, or the Ohio dealers in
intangibles tax.


Income of an Ohio Insured Trust will be treated as the income of the
Unit holders for purposes of the Ohio personal income tax, Ohio school
district income taxes, Ohio municipal income taxes and the Ohio
corporation franchise tax in proportion to the respective interest
therein of each Unit holder.


Interest on Ohio Obligations and Territorial Obligations held by an Ohio
Insured Trust is exempt from the Ohio personal income tax, Ohio
municipal income taxes and Ohio school district income taxes and is
excluded from the net income base of the Ohio corporation franchise tax
when distributed or deemed distributed to Unit holders.


Proceeds paid under insurance policies, if any, to the Trustee of an
Ohio Insured Trust, representing maturing interest on defaulted
obligations held by an Ohio Insured Trust will be exempt from the Ohio
personal income tax, Ohio school district income taxes, Ohio municipal
income taxes and the net income base of the Ohio corporation franchise
tax if, and to the same extent as, such interest would be exempt from
such taxes if paid directly by the issuer of such obligations.


Gains and losses realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition by
an Ohio Insured Trust of Ohio Obligations are excluded in determining
adjusted gross and taxable income for purposes of the Ohio personal
income tax, Ohio municipal income taxes and Ohio school district income
taxes and are excluded from the net income base of the Ohio corporation
franchise tax when distributed or deemed distributed to Unit holders.


For information with respect to the Federal income tax status and other
tax matters, see "What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?"



Certain Considerations



As described above, an Ohio Insured Trust will invest most of its net
assets in securities issued by or on behalf of (or in certificates of
participation in lease-purchase obligations of) the State of Ohio,
political subdivisions of the State, or agencies or instrumentalities of
the State or its political subdivisions (Ohio Obligations). An Ohio
Insured Trust is therefore susceptible to general or particular
political, economic or regulatory factors that may affect issuers of
Ohio Obligations. The following information constitutes only a brief
summary of some of the many complex factors that may have an effect. The
information does not apply to "conduit" obligations on which the public
issuer itself has no financial responsibility. This information is
derived from official statements of certain Ohio issuers published in
connection with their issuance of securities and from other publicly


Page 5


available information, and is believed to be accurate. No independent
verification has been made of any of the following information.


Generally, the creditworthiness of Ohio Obligations of local issuers is
unrelated to that of obligations of the State itself, and the State has
no responsibility to make payments on those local obligations.


There may be specific factors that at particular times apply in
connection with investment in particular Ohio Obligations or in those
obligations of particular Ohio issuers. It is possible that the
investment may be in particular Ohio Obligations, or in those of
particular issuers, as to which those factors apply. However, the
information below is intended only as a general summary, and is not
intended as a discussion of any specific factors that may affect any
particular obligation or issuer.


The timely payment of principal of and interest on Ohio Obligations has
been guaranteed by bond insurance purchased by the issuers, the Ohio
Trusts or other parties. Those Ohio Obligations may not be subject to
the factors referred to in this section of the Prospectus.


Ohio is the seventh most populous state; the 1990 Census count of
10,847,000 indicated a 0.5% population increase from 1980. The Census
estimate for 1996 is 11,173,000.


While diversifying more into the service and other non-manufacturing
areas, the Ohio economy continues to rely in part on durable goods
manufacturing largely concentrated in motor vehicles and equipment,
steel, rubber products and household appliances. As a result, general
economic activity, as in many other industrially-developed states, tends
to be more cyclical than in some other states and in the nation as a
whole. Agriculture is an important segment of the economy, with over
half the State's area devoted to farming and approximately 16% of total
employment in agribusiness.


In prior years, the State's overall unemployment rate was commonly
somewhat higher than the national figure. For example, the reported 1990
average monthly State rate was 5.7%, compared to the 5.5% national
figure. However, for the last six years, the State rates were below the
national rates (4.9% versus 5.4% in 1996). The unemployment rate and its
effects vary among geographic areas of the State.


There can be no assurance that future national, regional or state-wide
economic difficulties, and the resulting impact on State or local
government finances generally, will not adversely affect the market
value of Ohio Obligations held in the Ohio Trusts or the ability of
particular obligors to make timely payments of debt service on (or lease
payments relating to) those Obligations.


The State operates on the basis of a fiscal biennium for its
appropriations and expenditures, and is precluded by law from ending its
July 1 to June 30 fiscal year (FY) or fiscal biennium in a deficit
position. Most State operations are financed through the General Revenue
Fund (GRF), for which the personal income and sales-use taxes are the
major sources. Growth and depletion of GRF ending fund balances show a
consistent pattern related to national economic conditions, with the
ending FY balance reduced during less favorable and increased during
more favorable economic periods. The State has well-established
procedures for, and has timely taken, necessary actions to ensure
resource/expenditure balances during less favorable economic periods.
Those procedures included general and selected reductions in
appropriations spending.


The 1992-93 biennium presented significant challenges to State finances,
which were successfully addressed. To allow time to resolve certain
budget differences, an interim appropriations act was enacted effective
July 1, 1991; it included GRF debt service and lease rental
appropriations for the entire biennium, while continuing most other
appropriations for a month. Pursuant to the general appropriations act
for the entire biennium, passed on July 11, 1991, $200 million was
transferred from the Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF, a cash and
budgetary management fund) to the GRF in FY 1992.


Based on updated results and forecasts in the course of that fiscal
year, both in light of a continuing uncertain nationwide economic
situation, there was projected, and then timely addressed, an FY 1992
imbalance in GRF resources and expenditures. In response, the Governor
ordered most State agencies to reduce GRF spending in the last six
months of FY 1992 by a total of approximately $184 million; the $100.4
million BSF balance and additional amounts from certain other funds were
transferred late in the FY to the GRF, and adjustments were made in the
timing of certain tax payments.


A significant GRF shortfall (approximately $520 million) was then
projected for FY 1993. It was addressed by appropriate legislative and
administrative actions, including the Governor's ordering $300 million
in selected GRF spending reductions and subsequent executive and
legislative action (a combination of tax revisions and additional


Page 6


spending reductions). The June 30, 1993 ending GRF fund balance was
approximately $111 million, of which, as a first step to replenishment,
$21 million was deposited in the BSF.


None of the spending reductions were applied to appropriations needed
for debt service or lease rentals relating to any State obligations.


The 1994-95 biennium presented a more affirmative financial picture.
Based on June 30, 1994 balances, an additional $260 million was
deposited in the BSF. The biennium ended June 30, 1995 with a GRF ending
fund balance of $928 million, of which $535.2 million was transferred
into the BSF. The significant GRF fund balance, after leaving in the GRF
an unreserved and undesignated balance of $70 million, was transferred
to the BSF and other funds including school assistance funds and, in
anticipation of possible federal program changes, a human services
stabilization fund.


From a higher than forecast 1996-97 mid-biennium GRF fund balance, $100
million was transferred for elementary and secondary school computer
network purposes and $30 million to a new State transportation
infrastructure fund. Approximately $400.8 million served as a basis for
temporary 1996 personal income tax reductions aggregating that amount.
The 1996-97 biennium-ending GRF fund balance was $834.9 million. Of
that, $250 million goes to school building construction and renovation,
$94 million to the school computer network, $44.2 million for school
textbooks and instructional materials and a distance learning program,
and $34 million to the BSF (which had a January 8, 1998 balance of
$862.7 million), with the $263 million balance to a State income tax
reduction fund.


The GRF appropriations act for the 1997-98 biennium was passed on June
25, 1997 and promptly signed (after selective vetoes) by the Governor.
All necessary GRF appropriations for State debt service and lease rental
payments then projected for the biennium were included in that act.


The State's incurrence or assumption of debt without a vote of the
people is, with limited exceptions, prohibited by current State
constitutional provisions. The State may incur debt, limited in amount
to $750,000, to cover casual deficits or failures in revenues or to meet
expenses not otherwise provided for. The Constitution expressly
precludes the State from assuming the debts of any local government or
corporation. (An exception is made in both cases for any debt incurred
to repel invasion, suppress insurrection or defend the State in war.)


By 14 constitutional amendments, approved from 1921 to date (the last
adopted in 1995), Ohio voters have authorized the incurrence of State
debt and the pledge of taxes or excises to its payment. At January 8,
1998, $1.07 billion (excluding certain highway bonds payable primarily
from highway use receipts) of this debt was outstanding or sold and
awaiting delivery. The only such State debt at that date still
authorized to be incurred were portions of the highway bonds and the
following: (a) up to $100 million of obligations for coal research and
development may be outstanding at any one time ($30.9 million
outstanding); (b) of a total $2.4 billion which may be issued, $240
million of obligations previously authorized for local government
infrastructure improvements, no more than $120 million of which may be
issued in any calendar year ($946.9 million outstanding or sold and
awaiting delivery); and (c) up to $200 million in general obligation
bonds for parks, recreation and natural resources purposes which may be
outstanding at any one time ($90.9 million outstanding with no more than
$50 million to be issued in any one year).


The electors approved in November 1995 a constitutional amendment that
extends the local infrastructure bond program (authorizing an additional
$1.2 billion of State full faith and credit obligations to be issued
over 10 years for that purpose), and authorizes additional highway bonds
(expected to be payable primarily from highway use receipts). The latter
supersedes the prior $500 million outstanding authorization, and
authorizes not more that $1.2 billion to be outstanding at any time and
not more than $220 million to be issued in a fiscal year.


The Constitution also authorizes the issuance of State obligations for
certain purposes, the owners of which do not have the right to have
excises or taxes levied to pay debt service. Those special obligations
include obligations issued by the Ohio Public Facilities Commission and
the Ohio Building Authority, and certain obligations issued by the State
Treasurer, over $4.8 billion of which were outstanding at January 8, 1998.


A 1990 constitutional amendment authorizes greater State and political
subdivision participation (including financing) in the provision of
housing. The General Assembly may for that purpose authorize the
issuance of State obligations secured by a pledge of all or such portion
as it authorizes of State revenues or receipts (but not by a pledge of
the State's full faith and credit).


Page 7


A 1994 constitutional amendment pledges the full faith and credit and
taxing power of the State to meeting certain guarantees under the
State's tuition credit program which provides for purchase of tuition
credits, for the benefit of State residents, guaranteed to cover a
specified amount when applied to the cost of higher education tuition.
(A 1965 constitutional provision that authorized student loan guarantees
payable from available State moneys has never been implemented, apart
from a "guarantee fund" approach funded essentially from program
revenues).


State and local agencies issue obligations that are payable from
revenues from or relating to certain facilities (but not from taxes). By
judicial interpretation, these obligations are not "debt" within
constitutional provisions. In general, payment obligations under lease-
purchase agreements of Ohio public agencies (in which certificates of
participation may be issued) are limited in duration to the agency's
fiscal period, and are renewable only upon appropriations being made
available for the subsequent fiscal period.


Local school districts in Ohio receive a major portion (state-wide
aggregate approximately 44% in recent years) of their operating moneys
from State subsidies, but are dependent on local property taxes, and in
119 districts from voter-authorized income taxes, for significant
portions of their budgets. Litigation, similar to that in other states,
has been pending questioning the constitutionality of Ohio's system of
school funding. The Ohio Supreme Court has concluded that aspects of the
system (including basic operating assistance and the loan program
referred to below) are unconstitutional, and ordered the State to
provide for and fund a system complying with the Ohio Constitution,
staying its order for a year (to March 1998) to permit time for
responsive corrective actions. A small number of the State's 612 local
school districts have in any year required special assistance to avoid
year-end deficits. A program has provided for school district cash need
borrowing directly from commercial lenders, with diversion of State
subsidy distributions to repayment if needed. Recent borrowings under
this program totalled $41.1 million for 28 districts in FY 1994, $71.1
million for 29 districts in FY 1995 (including $29.5 million for one
district), $87.2 million for 20 districts in FY 1996 (including $42.1
million for one district) and $113.2 million for 12 districts in 1997
(including $90 million to one for restructuring its prior loans).


Ohio's 943 incorporated cities and villages rely primarily on property
and municipal income taxes for their operations. With other
subdivisions, they also receive local government support and property
tax relief moneys distributed by the State. For those few municipalities
and school districts that on occasion have faced significant financial
problems, there are statutory procedures for a joint State/local
commission to monitor the fiscal affairs and for development of a
financial plan to eliminate deficits and cure any defaults. (Similar
procedures have recently been extended to counties and townships.) Since
inception for municipalities in 1979, these "fiscal emergency"
procedures have been applied to 24 cities and villages; for 18 of them
the fiscal situation was resolved and the procedures terminated (one
village is in preliminary "fiscal watch" status). As of January 27,
1998, the 1996 school district "fiscal emergency" provision has been
applied to five districts and 12 districts were placed on preliminary
"fiscal watch" status.


At present the State itself does not levy ad valorem taxes on real or
tangible personal property. Those taxes are levied by political
subdivisions and other local taxing districts. The Constitution has
since 1934 limited to 1% of true value in money the amount of the
aggregate levy (including a levy for unvoted general obligations) of
property taxes by all overlapping subdivisions, without a vote of the
electors or a municipal charter provision, and statutes limit the amount
of that aggregate levy to 10 mills per $1 of assessed valuation
(commonly referred to as the "ten-mill limitation"). Voted general
obligations of subdivisions are payable from property taxes that are
unlimited as to amount or rate.


The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of
the general factors which may impact certain issuers of Bonds and does
not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse
conditions to which the issuers of Bonds held by the Ohio Trusts are
subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social
and environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the
control of the issuers of the Bonds, could affect or could have an
adverse impact on the financial condition of the issuers. The Sponsor is
unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other
factors may affect the issuers of the Bonds, the market value or
marketability of the Bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of
the Bonds acquired by the Ohio Trusts to pay interest on or principal of
the Bonds.

Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders



At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from
Federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective
issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to State Trusts, where
applicable, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as
to the exemption of interest on such Bonds when held by residents of the
State in which the issuers of such Bonds are located, from State income
taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes.
Neither the Sponsor, Chapman and Cutler, nor any of the Special Counsel
to the Fund for State tax matters have made any special review for the
Fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the
bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith. If the interest
on a Bond should be determined to be taxable, the Bond would generally
have to be sold at a substantial discount. In addition, investors could
be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on
which interest is determined to be taxable.


Gain realized on the sale or redemption of the Bonds by the Trustee or
of a Unit by a Unit holder is includable in gross income for Federal
income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax
purposes. (Such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of
accrued interest or accrued original issue discount, if any.) If a Bond
is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price paid for
the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond. When this
accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of capital and
reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased for a premium,
the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the Bond. Bond
premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond, and the tax
basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium
amortized in that tax year.


For purposes of the following opinions, it is assumed that each asset of
the Trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income
for Federal income tax purposes. At the time of the closing for each
Trust, Chapman and Cutler, Counsel for the Sponsor, rendered an opinion
under then existing law substantially to the effect that:


(1)   the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for
Federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue
discount on Bonds which is excludable from gross income under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") will retain its status for
Federal income tax purposes, when received by the Trusts and distributed
to a Unit holder; however, such interest may be taken into account in
computing the alternative minimum tax and the additional tax on branches
of foreign corporations and the environmental tax (the "Superfund Tax"),
as noted below. See "Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit
Holders";



ALL PARTS OF THE PROSPECTUS SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR





FUTURE REFERENCE.



THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY
OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.


Page 1


(2)   each Unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata
portion of each asset of the respective Trust under subpart E,
subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code and will have a taxable event when
the Trust disposes of a Bond, or when the Unit holder redeems or sells
his Units. If the Unit holder disposes of a Unit, he is deemed thereby
to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the
Trust involved including his pro rata portion of all the Bonds
represented by the Unit. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (the "1997
Act") includes provisions that treat certain transactions designed to
reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain (e.g. short
sales, offsetting notional principal contracts, futures or forward
contracts or similar transactions) as constructive sales for purposes of
recognition of gain (but not loss) and for purposes of determining the
holding period. Unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with
regard to any such constructive sale rules. Unit holders must reduce the
tax basis of their Units for their share of accrued interest received by
the respective Trust, if any, on Bonds before the date the Trust
acquired ownership of the Bonds (and the amount of this reduction may
exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller) and,
consequently, such Unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or
reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such Units. Gain or
loss upon the sale or redemption of Units is measured by comparing the
proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the
Units. If the Trustee disposes of Bonds (whether by sale, payment on
maturity, redemption or otherwise), gain or loss is recognized to the
Unit holder (subject to various non-recognition provisions of the Code).
The amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the Unit
holder's pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with
the Unit holder's basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset
disposed of. In the case of a Unit holder who purchases Units, such
basis (before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and
amortized bond premium, if any) is determined by apportioning the cost
of the Units among each of the Trust assets ratably according to value
as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the Units.
Unit holders should consult their own tax advisers with regard to the
calculation of basis. The tax basis reduction requirements of the Code
relating to amortization of bond premium may, under some circumstances,
result in the Unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his Units are
sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost;
and


(3)  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by
issuers of Bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds
held by the Trustee will be excludable from Federal gross income if, and
to the same extent as, such interest would have been so excludable if
paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted Bonds provided
that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such
policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable
expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer, will
pay debt service on the Bonds.


Sections 1288 and 1272 of the Code provide a complex set of rules
governing the accrual of original issue discount. These rules provide
that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant
compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the Bond, depending
on the date the Bond was issued. In addition, special rules apply if the
purchase price of a Bond exceeds the original issue price plus the
amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued
based upon its issue price (its "adjusted issue price") to prior owners.
If a Bond is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price
paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond.
When this accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of
capital and reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased
for a premium, the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of
the Bond. Bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond,
and the tax basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of
the premium amortized in that tax year. The application of these rules
will also vary depending on the value of the Bond on the date a Unit
holder acquires his Unit, and the price the Unit holder pays for his
Unit. Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these
rules and their application. See "Portfolio" appearing in Part One for
each Trust for information relating to Bonds, if any, issued at an
original issue discount.


The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the "Tax Act") subjects tax-
exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the Code effective for
bonds purchased after April 30, 1993. In general, market discount is the
amount (if any) by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds
an investor's purchase price (except to the extent that such difference,


Page 2


if any, is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued),
subject to statutory de minimis rule. Market discount can arise based on
the price a Trust pays for Bonds or the price a Unit holder pays for his
or her Units. Under the Tax Act, accretion of market discount is taxable
as ordinary income; under prior law the accretion had been treated as
capital gain. Market discount that accretes while a Trust holds a Bond
would be recognized as ordinary income by the Unit holders when
principal payments are received on the Bond, upon sale or at redemption
(including early redemption) or upon the sale or redemption of his or
her Units, unless a Unit holder elects to include market discount in
taxable income as it accrues. The market discount rules are complex and
Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and
their application.


Counsel for the Sponsor has also advised that under Section 265 of the
Code, interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or
carry Units of a Trust is not deductible for Federal income tax
purposes. The Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that such
indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying
of Units (however, these rules generally do not apply to interest paid
on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence).
Also, under Section 265 of the Code, certain financial institutions that
acquire Units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest
expense attributable to ownership of Units. Legislative proposals have
been made that would extend the financial institution rules to certain
other corporations including securities dealers and other financial
intermediaries. Investors with questions regarding these issues should
consult with their tax advisers.


In the case of certain of the Bonds in a Trust, the opinions of bond
counsel indicate that interest on such Bonds received by a "substantial
user" of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these Bonds,
or persons related thereto, for periods while such Bonds are held by
such a user or related person, will not be excludable from Federal gross
income, although interest on such Bonds received by others would be
excludable from Federal gross income. "Substantial user" and "related
person" are defined under the Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations. Any
person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related
person as so defined should contact his tax adviser.


ALL STATEMENTS OF LAW IN THE PROSPECTUS CONCERNING EXCLUSION FROM GROSS
INCOME FOR FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER TAX PURPOSES ARE THE OPINIONS OF
COUNSEL AND ARE TO BE SO CONSTRUED.


At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from
Federal gross income are rendered by bond counsel to the respective
issuing authorities. Neither the Sponsor nor Chapman and Cutler has made
any special review for the Fund of the proceedings relating to the
issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for such opinions.


In general, Section 86 of the Code provides that 50% of Social Security
benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of
"modified adjusted gross income" plus 50% of the Social Security
benefits received exceeds the "base amount." The base amount is $25,000
for unmarried taxpayers, $32,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint
return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times
during the taxable year and who file separate returns. Modified adjusted
gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to
certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income
and by including tax-exempt interest. To the extent that Social Security
benefits are includible in gross income, they will be treated as any
other item of gross income.


In addition, under the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after
December 31 1993, up to 85% of Social Security benefits are includible
in gross income to the extent that the sum of "modified adjusted gross
income" plus 50% of Social Security benefits received exceeds an
"adjusted base amount." The adjusted base amount is $34,000 for
unmarried taxpayers, $44,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint
return, and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all
times during the taxable year and who file separate returns.


Although tax-exempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross
income solely for the purpose of determining what portion, if any, of
Social Security benefits will be included in gross income, no tax-exempt
interest, including that received from a Trust, will be subject to tax.
A taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount
or the adjusted base amount must include 50% or 85%, respectively, of
his Social Security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives
any tax-exempt interest. A taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income
(after inclusion of tax-exempt interest) does not exceed the base amount
need not include any Social Security benefits in gross income.

For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals
and corporations, interest on certain private activity bonds (which
includes most industrial and housing revenue bonds) issued on or after
August 8, 1986 is included as an item of tax preference. EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE NOTED IN PART ONE FOR CERTAIN TRUSTS, THE TRUSTS DO NOT
INCLUDE ANY SUCH PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS ISSUED ON OR AFTER THAT DATE.


For taxpayers other than corporations, net capital gains (which is
defined as net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss
for the taxable year) are subject to a maximum marginal stated tax rate
of either 28% or 20%, depending upon the holding period of the capital
assets. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the holding period for the
asset is more than one year, and is short-term if the holding period for
the asset is one year or less. Generally, capital gain realized from
assets held for more than one year but not more than 18 months are taxed
at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 28% and capital gains realized
from assets (with certain exclusions) held for more than 18 months are
taxed at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 20% (10% in the case of
certain taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket). Further, capital gains
realized from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same
rate as ordinary income. Legislation is currently pending that provides
the appropriate methodology that should be applied in netting the
realized capital gains and losses. Such legislation is proposed to be
effective retroactively for tax years ending after May 6, 1997. The date
on which a Unit is acquired (i.e., the "trade date") is excluded for
purposes of determining the holding period of the Unit. It should be
noted that legislative proposals are introduced from time to time that
affect tax rates and could affect relative differences at which ordinary
income and capital gains are taxed.


In addition, please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as
ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are
considered "conversion transactions" effective for transactions entered
into after April 30, 1993. Unit holders and prospective investors should
consult with their tax advisers regarding the potential effect of this
provision on their investment in Units.


Under the Code, taxpayers must disclose to the Internal Revenue Service
the amount of tax-exempt interest earned during the year.


Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit Holders. In the case of
certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax and the Superfund Tax
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986 depend upon the
corporation's alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is the
corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the
adjustment items used in computing AMTI of a corporation (other than an
S Corporation, Regulated Investment Company, Real Estate Investment
Trust, or REMIC) is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such
corporation's "adjusted current earnings" over an amount equal to its
AMTI (before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating
loss deduction). "Adjusted current earnings" includes all tax-exempt
interest, including interest on all of the Bonds in the Trusts. Under
current Code provisions, the Superfund Tax does not apply to tax years
beginning on or after January 1, 1996. Legislative proposals have been
introduced that would reinstate the Superfund Tax for taxable years
beginning after December 31, 1997 and before January 1, 2009. Under the
provisions of Section 884 of the Code, a branch profits tax is levied on
the "effectively connected earnings and profits" of certain foreign
corporations which include tax-exempt interest such as interest on the
Bonds in the Trust. Unit holders should consult their tax advisers with
respect to the particular tax consequences to them, including the
corporate alternative minimum tax, the Superfund Tax and the branch
profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the Code.


Ownership of the Units may result in collateral federal income tax
consequences to certain taxpayers, including, without limitation,
corporations, subject to the branch profits tax, financial institutions,
certain insurance companies, certain S corporations, individual
recipients of Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and
taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred (or continued) indebtedness
to purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisers as to the applicability of any such
collateral consequences.


At the time of the closing, Winston & Strawn (previously named Cole &
Deitz), Special Counsel to Series 4-125 of the Fund for New York tax
matters, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax laws of the
State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that each Trust
in Series 4-125 of the Fund is not an association taxable as a
corporation and the income of each Trust in Series 4-125 of the Fund


Page 4


will be treated as the income of the Unit holder in the same manner as
for Federal income tax purposes (subject to differences in accounting
for discount and premium to the extent the State and/or City of New York
do not conform to current Federal law).


At the time of the closing, Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, Special Counsel
to the Fund for New York tax matters for Series 126 and subsequent
Series of the Fund, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax
laws of the State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that
each Trust will not constitute an association taxable as a corporation
under New York law, and accordingly will not be subject to the New York
State franchise tax or the New York City general corporation tax. Under
the income tax laws of the State and City of New York, the income of
each Trust will be considered the income of the holders of the Units.


All statements in the Prospectus concerning exclusion from gross income
for Federal, state or other are the opinions of Counsel and are to be so
construed.



Pennsylvania Tax Status of Unit Holders



In rendering its opinion, Special Counsel has not, for timing reasons,
made an independent review of proceedings related to the issuance of the
Bonds. It has relied on the Sponsor for assurance that the Bonds have
been issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or by or on behalf of
municipalities or other governmental agencies within the Commonwealth.


At the time of the closing for each Pennsylvania Trust, Special Counsel
to the Fund for Pennsylvania tax matters rendered an opinion under then
existing Pennsylvania income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose
income is subject to Pennsylvania income taxation substantially to the
effect that:


Units evidencing fractional undivided interests in a Pennsylvania Trust,
which are represented by obligations issued by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, any public authority, commission, board or other agency
created by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, any political subdivision
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any public authority created by
any such political subdivision, are not taxable under any of the
personal property taxes presently in effect in Pennsylvania;


Distributions of interest income to Unit holders that would not be
taxable if received directly by a Pennsylvania resident are not subject
to personal income tax under the Pennsylvania Tax Reform Code of 1971;
nor will such interest be taxable under the Philadelphia School District
Investment Income Tax imposed on Philadelphia resident individuals;


A Unit holder will have a taxable event under the Pennsylvania state and
local income taxes referred to in the preceding paragraph upon the
redemption or sale of his Units. Units will be taxable under the
Pennsylvania inheritance and estate taxes;


A Unit holder which is a corporation will have a taxable event under the
Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax when it redeems or sells its
Units. Interest income distributed to Unit holders which are
corporations is not subject to Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax or
Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax. However, banks, title insurance
companies and trust companies may be required to take the value of the
Units into account in determining the taxable value of their shares
subject to the Shares tax;


Under Act No. 68 of December 3, 1993, gains derived by a Pennsylvania
Trust from the sale, exchange or other disposition of Bonds may be
subject to Pennsylvania personal or corporate income taxes. Those gains
which are distributed by a Pennsylvania Trust to Unit holders who are
individuals may be subject to Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax. For Unit
holders which are corporations, the distributed gains may be subject to
Corporate Net Income Tax or Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax. Gains which
are not distributed by a Pennsylvania Trust may nevertheless be taxable
to Unit holders if derived by a Pennsylvania Trust from the sale,
exchange or other disposition of Bonds issued on or after February 1,
1994. Gains which are not distributed by a Pennsylvania Trust will
remain nontaxable to Unit holders if derived by a Pennsylvania Trust
from the sale, exchange or other disposition of Bonds issued prior to
February 1, 1994.


Any proceeds paid under insurance policies issued to the Trustee or
obtained by issuers of the Bonds with respect to the Bonds which
represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee
will be excludable from Pennsylvania gross income if, and to the same
extent as, such interest would have been so excludable if paid by the
issuer of the defaulted obligations;


A Pennsylvania Trust is not taxable as a corporation under Pennsylvania
tax laws applicable to corporations.


Page 5


On December 3, 1993, changes to Pennsylvania laws affecting taxation of
income and gains from the sale of Pennsylvania and local obligations
were enacted. Among these changes was the repeal of the exemption from
tax of gains realized upon the sale or other disposition of such
obligations. The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue has issued proposed
regulations concerning these changes. The opinions expressed above are
based on Special Counsel's analysis of the law and proposed regulations,
but are subject to modification upon review of final regulations or
other guidance that may be issued by the Department of Revenue or future
court decisions.

tax matters, see "What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?"



Certain Considerations



Investors should be aware of certain factors that might affect the
financial conditions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
historically has been identified as a heavy industry state although that
reputation has changed recently as the industrial composition of the
Commonwealth diversified when the coal, steel and railroad industries
began to decline. A more diversified economy was necessary as the
traditionally strong industries in the Commonwealth declined due to a
long-term shift in jobs, investment and workers away from the northeast
part of the nation. The major sources of growth in Pennsylvania are in
the service sector, including trade, medical and the health services,
education and financial institutions. Pennsylvania's agricultural
industries are also an important component of the Commonwealth's
economic structure, particularly in crop and livestock products as well
as agribusiness and food related industries.


Strong growth experienced in Pennsylvania in 1997 was unanticipated and
is unlikely to continue. The peak growth was reached during the first
quarter and growth in subsequent quarters has been lower. Due to
Pennsylvania's improved competitive position, the Commonwealth should
experience economic growth rates close to the national average. The
annual rate of job growth, ranked 45th in 1995, is currently ranked 17th
nationwide.


Non-manufacturing employment has increased in recent years to 82.9% of
total Commonwealth employment as of December 1997. Consequently,
manufacturing employment constitutes a diminished share of total
employment within the Commonwealth. Manufacturing, contributing 17.1% of
non-agricultural employment as of December 1997, has fallen behind both
the services sector and the trade sector as the largest single source of
employment within the Commonwealth. In December 1997, the services
sector accounted for 31.6% of all non-agricultural employment while the
trade sector accounted for 22.8%.


Preliminary results from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and
Industry show Pennsylvania's total non-farm jobs increased by 106,200 or
almost 2% from December 1996 to December 1997. The services industry was
responsible for over one-half of all new jobs created during this
period. Retail trade increased 1.5% or 14,000 jobs. Construction
employment increased 7.4% or 15,200 jobs. Manufacturing growth was slow
at .4% or 4,100 jobs from December 1996 to December 1997. As of December
1997, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the Commonwealth was
4.8% compared to 4.7% for the United States.


More jobs in 1997 brought faster growing personal income. For the four
quarters ending with the first quarter of 1997, personal income in
Pennsylvania rose at a rate of over 6%. This healthy advance contributed
to a 6.1% increase in General Fund tax revenue for fiscal year 1996-97
due to similar increases in collections for personal income tax and the
sales and use tax.


Financial information for the principal operating funds of the
Commonwealth is maintained on a budgetary basis of accounting. A
budgetary basis of accounting is used for the purpose of ensuring
compliance with the enacted operating budget and is governed by
applicable statutes of the Commonwealth and by administrative
procedures. The Commonwealth also prepares annual financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
The budgetary basis financial information maintained by the Commonwealth
to monitor and enforce budgetary control is adjusted at fiscal year-end
to reflect appropriate accruals for financial reporting in conformity
with GAAP.


Fiscal 1997 Financial Results. At June 30, 1997, the Commonwealth
reported an unreserved/undesignated fund balance (budgetary basis) of
$402.7 million in the General Fund. This compares to a budgetary basis
fund balance of $158.5 million at June 30, 1996. The budgetary basis
fund balance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 was the result of
revenue collections totaling $26,149.6 million less appropriation


Page 6


authorizations totaling $25,835.7 million, less other net financing uses
totaling $69.7 million. Included in the $25,835.7 million appropriation
authorizations are $164.3 million of state supplemental appropriations
and $207.0 million in federal supplemental appropriations authorized
during the fiscal year.


On a GAAP basis, at June 30, 1997, the Commonwealth's General Fund
reported a fund balance of $1,364.9 million, an increase of $729.7
million from the $635.2 million fund balance at June 30, 1996. Total
assets increased by $563.4 million to $4,268.5 million. Liabilities
decreased $166.3 million to $2,903.6 million.


For fiscal year 1996-97, revenues of the Commonwealth's General, Special
Revenue, Debt Service and Capital Projects Funds (collectively, the
governmental funds) totaled $32,073 million, an increase of $1,147
million or 3.7% from fiscal year 1995-96. Taxes accounted for 56.6% of
the total general governmental revenues. Their combined fund balances at
June 30, 1997 increased by $914.6 million to $2,900.9 million. The
unreserved/undesignated fund balance was $699.2 million compared to
$378.2 million from the previous year.


Fiscal 1998 Budget. Total receipts for fiscal year 1997-98 are projected
at $17,077 million. Appropriations are estimated at $17,269 million. The
closing balance in the General Fund (after adding the beginning balance
of $403 billion and deducting lapses of $120 million) is $331 million.
After a transfer to the Rainy Day Fund of $50 million, the ending
balance in the General Fund for fiscal year 1997-98 is estimated at $281
million.


Estimated revenues for 1997-98 have been raised $231.1 million due to
substantial upward revisions to personal income and inheritance revenues
and downward revisions to sales and use and insurance premiums taxes.
The personal income tax has provided almost all of the revenue surplus.
Through December 1997, fiscal year 1997-98 revenues have increased 2.8%
over the same period in the prior fiscal year. Revised estimates for
1997-98 project a 2.1% increase in General Fund revenues. Total
revenues, excluding proposed tax changes, are projected to increase by
2.9%.


Proposed Fiscal 1999 Budget. The Governor's 1998-99 Budget continues a
four-year record of tax cuts and fiscal discipline. The proposed 1998-99
General Fund Budget is $17.8 billion, an increase of $518 million or 3%.
The total recommended budget for 1998-99 is $35.8 billion. Approximately
$10.16 billion is from federal funds.


General Fund revenue is estimated to be generated in the following
percentages: 34.7% from sales tax, 34.2% from personal income tax, 12.5%
from business tax, 9.3% from corporate net income tax, 5.4% from other
revenues, and 3.9% from the inheritance tax. Total expenditures for
fiscal year 1998-99 are estimated in the following percentages: 44.3%
for education, 34.4% for health and human services, 11.3% for
protection, 3.8% for direction programs, 3.1% for other programs, and
3.1% for economic development.


Budgets for the past four years have proposed an average spending growth
of 2.0%. The average growth in the enacted budgets during the previous
ten-year period was 5.4%. Over $128 million in tax reductions are
proposed in 1998-99 to help working families and to stimulate job
creation and retention.


After an estimated $2 million transfer to the Rainy Day Fund in 1998-99,
the ending fund balance for the General Fund for fiscal year 1998-99 is
estimated at $9 million. With the projected transfer at the end of 1998-
99, the reserve balance in the Commonwealth's Rainy Day Fund will exceed
$500 million, more than seven times the balance in 1994-95.


Debt Administration. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania permits the incurrence of debt, without approval of the
electorate, for capital projects specifically authorized in a capital
budget. Capital project debt outstanding cannot exceed one and three
quarters (1.75) times the average of the annual tax revenues deposited
in all funds during the previous five fiscal years. The certified
constitutional debt limit at August 29, 1997 was $34.3 billion.
Outstanding capital project debt at August 29, 1997 amounted to $3.7
billion.


In addition to constitutionally authorized capital project debt, the
Commonwealth may incur debt for electorate approved programs, such as
economic revitalization, land and water development, and water
facilities restoration; and for special purposes approved by the General
Assembly, such as disaster relief. The total general obligation bond
indebtedness outstanding at June 30, 1997 was $4,842 million. Total debt
service transfers paid from General Fund and Motor License Fund
appropriations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 amounted to
$781.5 million.


Page 7


All outstanding general obligation bonds of the Commonwealth are rated
AA- by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's. Any explanation concerning the
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies.
There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.


In addition to general obligation bonds, the Commonwealth issues tax
anticipation notes ("TANS") to meet operating cash needs during certain
months of the fiscal year. The Commonwealth anticipates issuance of $225
million in General Fund TANS during the 1997-98 fiscal year. During
fiscal year 1996-97, $550 million TANS were issued.


The City of Philadelphia ("Philadelphia") is the largest city in the
Commonwealth, with an estimated population of 1,478,002 in 1996,
according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Philadelphia functions both
as a city of the first class and a county for the purpose of
administering various governmental programs.


Legislation providing for the establishment of the Pennsylvania
Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority ("PICA") to assist first class
cities in remedying fiscal emergencies was enacted by the General
Assembly and approved by the Governor in June 1991. PICA is designed to
provide assistance through the issuance of funding debt to liquidate
budget deficits and to make factual findings and recommendations to the
assisted city concerning its budgetary and fiscal affairs. An
intergovernmental cooperation agreement between Philadelphia and PICA
was approved by City Council on January 3, 1992, and approved by the
PICA Board and signed by the Mayor on January 8, 1992. At this time,
Philadelphia is operating under a five-year fiscal plan approved by PICA
on April 30, 1996.


As of February 28, 1997, PICA has issued approximately $1,761.7 million
of its Special Tax Revenue Bonds to provide financial assistance to
Philadelphia, to liquidate the cumulative General Fund balance deficit,
to refund certain general obligation bonds of the City and to fund
additional capital projects. No further PICA bonds are to be issued by
PICA for the purpose of financing a capital project or deficit as the
authority for such bond sales expired on December 31, 1994. PICA's
authority to issue debt for the purpose of financing a cash flow deficit
expired on December 31, 1996. Its ability to refund existing outstanding
debt is unrestricted. PICA had $1,102.4 million in Special Tax Revenue
Bonds outstanding as of June 30, 1997.


The audited General fund balance of the City as of June 30, 1995, 1996,
and 1997 showed a surplus of approximately $80.5 million, $118.5
million, and $128.8 million, respectively.


S&P's rating on Philadelphia's general obligation bonds is "BBB" and
Moody's rating is "Baa." Any explanation concerning the significance of
such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no
assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that
they will not be revised or withdrawn.


It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations issued by
local Pennsylvania issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and there is no
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local
obligations in the event of default.


The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of
the general factors which may impact certain issuers of Bonds and does
not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse
conditions to which the issuers of Bonds held by the Pennsylvania Trusts
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic,
social and environmental policies and conditions, which are not within
the control of the issuers of the Bonds, could affect or could have an
adverse impact on the financial condition of the issuers. The Sponsor is
unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other
factors may affect the issuers of the Bonds, the market value or
marketability of the Bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of
the Bonds acquired by the Pennsylvania Trusts to pay interest on or
principal of the Bonds.
