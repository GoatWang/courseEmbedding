Quick Facts

    TPi stocks over 1000 microingredients (vitamins, trace minerals, amino acids, neutraceuticals, etc…), manufactures custom premixes, and operates distribution channels to customers west of the Continental Divide. We also distribute internationally to several countries along the Pacific Rim, Canada, and Mexico. Our customers are livestock feed companies, pet food companies, and vertically integrated food companies.  Furthermore, our manufacturing plant and distribution centers are clean, well maintained and managed by competent and experienced employees.  Everyday our goal is to treat those around us how we would like to be treated while providing a level of quality assurance that surpasses industry standards.  TPi was incorporated in May, 1989 and officially opened in 1990. Our stock was purchased by Land O' Lakes Purina Feed in July, 1997, and we operate as a Nutra Blend Brand. 


Quick Facts

    TPi has two manufacturing plants situated on one property in Madera, CA. On the property there is our Main Plant and our Specialty Premix Plant (SPP). The SPP plant evolved as equine customers and end consumers began requesting feeds made in an ionophore (Rumensin® & Bovatec®) free plant. We accepted the challenge and met the requests. After five years of ionophore free status, we chose to make the SPP 100% medication free. No medications are allowed in the SPP and we control contamination up the procurement chain. The SPP has multiple mixers, an Air-Swept-Pullverizer, liquid pumping systems, a tablet press, and several packaging options. The SPP has the capability to manufacture various sized orders from 25 lbs to a full truckload. The production staff in the SPP is our most experienced and include employees that have been with TPi since the early 90’s. 


Quick Facts

    TPi strives daily to improve our customers’ confidence level  with our products and custom premixes. We are 100% compliant with the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002(Bioterrorism Act/BTA) through our own lot tracking and bar coding system. We are also Safe Feed/Safe Food Certified, and efforts are underway to become HACCP certified. Other quality assurance certifications under consideration are FAMI-QS, ISO9001, NASC, and several private certifications. Overall TPi’s goal is to meet or exceed our customers’ needs for Quality Assurance through cooperation, transparency, processing, and innovation.



Quick Facts

    TPi’s domestic market territory consists of states along and west of the Continental Divide. TPi also accesses the international market through the ports of Long Beach, CA; Oakland, CA; and Portland, OR. We do interact and extend our domestic market territory with our sister company based out of Neosho, MO called Nutra Blend. Nutra Blend’s market territory is mainly the states east of the Continental Divide. TPi and Nutra Blend’s market territories provide us with a nationwide footprint for the efficient distribution of microingredients and high quality premixes.

Apartments for rent in Texas
Interested in moving to Texas where everything's bigger? Texas has a variety of apartments (big and small) for rent in Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio and many other great cities.

Austin, Texas is home to big music with more music venues per capita than any other city across the nation. Along 6th Street, you'll find Austin apartments near bars, clubs, art galleries and cafes where live music is regularly featured in every genre you can imagine. Austin also hosts popular music festivals, such as South by Southwest (SXSW), Austin City Limits Music Festival and many others.

There's more to enjoy in Austin than music, though. With more than 250 parks, preserves and greenbelts in Austin, you'll have easy access to greenspace for walks, picnics, tennis matches and more. The University of Texas at Austin adds a feeling of livelihood and a youthful spirit that many Texas apartment dwellers find very appealing.

If you're more interested in living close to beaches, head southwest to Houston, where you'll find Texas apartments within an hour's drive to beaches such as Galveston Beach. Houston is also home to the Johnson Space Center, The University of Houston and a great museum district.

You'll also find great apartments in Dallas, Texas. In this city of more than a million residents, there are plenty of options for work and play. Whether you're looking for a night on the town, a variety of restaurant options or something fun for your kids to do, you can find all these things and more near Dallas apartments.

If you rent an apartment in San Antonio, you'll see that this city has a lot to offer, including the Paseo del Rio (the San Antonio River Walk), numerous theme parks and charming neighborhoods that not only attract visitors, but keep long-time residents in the area. And it's perhaps most known for its Tejano culture, the historic Alamo and the 16-time NBA Champions, the San Antonio Spurs. San Antonio also boasts a cost of living that's significantly lower than the national average. As a result, San Antonio apartments are available across a wide range of price points.

From the inexpensive to the luxurious, you can find just the right apartment for your taste and budget in Texas cities like Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, as well as in smaller cities throughout the state.
