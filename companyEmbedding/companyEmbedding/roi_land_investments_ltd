Announces Land Purchase Agreement to Acquire a 225 Acres (9,801,000 Square Feet) Parcel of Land in the Town of Evans, Colorado.GlobeNewswire Europe•January 12, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareQUEBEC CITY, Quebec, January 12th, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ROI Land Investments Ltd. (ROII) ("ROI" or the "Company"), a diversified real estate land development investment company announced today it entered into a Land Purchase Agreement ("Agreement") to acquire 225 acres (9,801,000 square feet) land parcel located in the Town of Evans, which is adjacent to Greeley, in the North-East part of Colorado, 60 miles (one hour) from it`s capital, Denver. Both towns represent a population of approximately 93,000 people in a market composed of the following characteristics: Low vacancy rates increase rents and driving renters to buy a houseCurrent low interest rates make home ownership more affordableFood industry within the country is in expansion thus far creating new jobs Towns of Greely and Evans:Both towns located in Weld County, one of the largest in the country that traditionally has attracted oil & gas companies using fracking technology for drilling oil wells.  Other industries are also expanding in Weld County where property taxes are very low, 0.75%.   In the lasts 12 months, appreciation of homes was 19% and inventory lasted 1 month. The market value of Weld County agricultural products exceed $1.5 billion and is consistently ranked in the top ten in the country for amount of agricultural products sold. Weld county ranks third in the U.S. for value of livestock and 30% of jobs are related to agriculture.  The rest of the work force are in small businesses, healthcare, education and government.  The energy industry is big in Weld County and still growing.  More oil and gas well permits have been approved here than in any other county in Colorado.  Weld County is greatly located with wide open plains and perfect for wind-generated electricity production. In a recent report issued by Wells Fargo Securities LLC and information obtained by the U.S. Department of Commerce indicated that Economic growth in Colorado has out paced the nation for the past two years.  Strong population growth and a relatively young population have fueled job growth in the state. Colorado`s population is the third fastest growing of any state since 2010, rising a cumulative 6.1 percent. In addition, with a median age of 36.4 years, Colorado is the 12th youngest of all states. The relatively young population has helped fuel urbanization, with the population of the state`s largest metro area, Denver, accounting for more than its fair share of the state`s population growth since 2010.Weld County has seen the strongest job growth of any county in the country over the past year, with nonfarm payrolls rising 8.9 percent from June 2013 to June 2014, which is the latest data available from the QCEW series. We fear that the recent fall in energy prices may have negative effects on the resources & mining sector, however, and June may be the high-water mark for job growth in this sector. The state`s sizable alternative energy industry may also be in for a dry spell. Lower energy prices make it more difficult for many alternative energy projects to stand on their own, just as many tax incentives are being scaled back. Fortunately, Colorado has an incredibly diverse economy and should be able to weather these changes, even though overall growth will likely slow. Source: U.S. Department of Labor and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, December 30th, 2014.About Colorado State Housing:Strong population and employment growth, particularly in high-paying jobs, has supported Colorado`s housing market. Home sales in Colorado were roughly flat from a year ago through the third quarter, compared to the nation, where sales have declined year over year. Single-family sales, however, declined 4.3 percent year over year and sales of condos and townhomes increased 19.4 percent. This is not surprising, given the rapid growth of Colorado`s metro areas and the relatively young population. Young people, particularly in urban environments, tend to live in apartments rather than single-family homes. Home prices have surpassed their prerecession levels in Colorado and now stand 11.2 percent above their prerecession peak. Conversely in the nation, home prices remain 12.4 percent below their prerecession levels. Although home price appreciation has moderated as of late, home prices were still 8.6 percent higher than a year ago in October. In the nation, however, home prices were only 6.1 percent higher. Improving permits data points to continued strengthening in construction activity in the future. It appears that the majority of construction in the multifamily market is in the apartment segment rather than condominiums.Read MoreSingle-family construction remains well off its pre-recession levels and historical norms. Stronger population growth and improving household formations should drive home sales higher in the coming year and give single-family construction a much needed boost. The growing trend toward urbanization and the state`s relatively young population, however, will likely continue to tilt demand toward rental housing and apartments and continue to play a moderating influence on home purchases.

ROI Land Investments Ltd (OTCPK:ROII)
Property, Plant and Equipment
=GURUF("ROII","Property, Plant and Equipment")

$15.45 Mil (As of Mar. 2016)
ROI Land Investments Ltd's quarterly net PPE declined from Sep. 2015 ($15.07 Mil) to Dec. 2015 ($14.80 Mil) but then increased from Dec. 2015 ($14.80 Mil) to Mar. 2016 ($15.45 Mil).
ROI Land Investments Ltd's annual net PPE increased from Dec. 2013 ($0.00 Mil) to Dec. 2014 ($8.96 Mil) and increased from Dec. 2014 ($8.96 Mil) to Dec. 2015 ($14.80 Mil).

Definition
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are the fixed assets of the companyFixed assets are also known as non-current assets.
Property, plant, and equipment includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers.
Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are:

	Land
	Buildings (and leasehold improvements)
	Transportation equipment
	Manufacturing equipment
	Office equipment
	Office furniture

Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes:

	Track
	Ties
	Ballast
	Bridges
	Tunnels
	Signals
	Locomotives
	Freight Cars

There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a companys 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns.
The market value of property, plant, and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property, plant, and equipment.
For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away. That property, plant, and equipment was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land.
All property, plant, and equipment other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost.
The property, plant, and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property, plant, and equipment. This means it is the cost of the property, plant, and equipment less accumulated depreciation.

Explanation
A company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive. The company replaces when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.
Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows, whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance.
Producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson etc.
