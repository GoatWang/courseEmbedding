TOA
Distribution Systems Inc

(formerly
known as Skyhigh Resources Inc) 

Notes to
Financial Statements

September
30, 2016

 

NOTE
1.                           
BASIS
OF PRESENTATION

 

In August
2009 the Company initiated a number of corporate changes, including
1), a name change to TOA Distribution Systems Inc, (formerly known
as Skyhigh Resources Inc, 2) approved a 10 for 1 roll forward of
its issued and outstanding common stock, 3), increased it
authorized par value $0.001 common shares to 250,000,000 shares
(formerly 50,000,000), and 4), authorized 10,000,000 par value
$0.001 preferred shares.

 

In
mid-2009, the Company resolved to change its corporate focus,
moving from mining and exploration into bottled drinking water
distribution.

 

The
Company owned two (2) mineral properties acquired from related
parties in January 2008 by issuing stock to related parties. The
purchase price was fully impaired. In February 2012 these claims
were deemed surplus and were sold in May 2012.

 

On
September 2, 2009 the Company entered into to a Sub-Distribution
agreement with Taste of Aruba (US), Inc to distribute bottled water
products produced in Aruba by Taste of Aruba-Premium Aruban
Water.   The territory in which the Company can
distribute these products include the United States and all its
territories and insular areas in the Caribbean and Pacific such as
but not limited to Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Marshall
Islands, and Guam, and all of Canada.  In January 2016, the
Company and Taste of Aruba agreed to cancel the Sub-Distribution
agreement on a no loss no gain basis for either party. Taste of
Aruba was unable to confirm when its products would be available
for resale. The 17,000,000 shares issued to cover the cost of the
Sub-Distribution Agreement have been returned and were cancelled on
January18, 2016. This transaction which included full impairment
has been reversed in the financial records for the year ended March
31, 2016.

In the
opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related
statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity include
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items,
necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP"). Preparing financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and
outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions
.

NOTE
2.                           
GOING
CONCERN

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United
States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company
as a going concern.  However, the Company has no business
operations to date, accumulated losses amounting to $178,776 and
must secure additional financing to commence the Company's plan of
operations, which means there is substantial concern about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company
intends to acquire additional operating capital through equity
offerings to the public to fund its business plan or loans from
shareholders and others. There is no assurance that the equity
offerings will be successful or loans will be received to provide
sufficient funds to commence operations or to assure the eventual
profitability of the Company.

 

NOTE
3.                           
SUB-DISTRIBUTION
AGREEMENT

 

On
September 2, 2009 the Company signed an Exclusive Sub-Distribution
Agreement ("Agreement") with Taste of Aruba (US) Inc, a State of
Nevada Incorporated company, owner and master distributor of
products from Taste of Aruba-Premium Aruban Water. Under the
Agreement, the Company would have  distributed in the United
States, its territories and insular areas in the Caribbean and
Pacific and Canada, bottled water produced under license in Aruba
by Water Energy Company-Aruba.

 

  

 

NOTE
3.                           
SUB-DISTRIBUTION
AGREEMENT (cont'd)

 

In January
2016, the Company and Taste of Aruba agreed to cancel the
Sub-Distribution agreement on a no loss no gain basis for either
party. Taste of Aruba was unable to confirm when its products would
be available for resale. The 17,000,000 shares issued to cover the
cost of the Sub-Distribution Agreement have been returned and were
cancelled on January18, 2016. This transaction which included full
impairment has been reversed in the financial records for the year
ended March 31, 2016.

 

T he
Company periodically reviews for impairment its long-lived assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management has
determined that its Distribution Agreement asset requires
impairment. As no sale activities have occurred, no product is yet
available for sale and funds to establish a sales and distribution
operation have not been secured.

 

NOTE
4.                           
LOANS
PAYABLE

 

Loans
payable to related parties, were received from a director of the
Company and others closely associated persons or businesses. These
funds were provided as cash loans to cover operating expenses and
as payment for services provided.

 

Loans
payable to the past and current presidents totaled $6,306 made up
of principal amounting to $3,742 and accrued interest of
$2,564

 

Loans
payable to a closely associated business totaled 93,219 made up of
principal amounting to $78,815 and accrued interest amounting to
$14,404.

 

In
aggregate, Loans Payable Related Parties to September 30, 2016
totaled $99,526 made up of $82,558 for principal and $16,968 for
accrued interest.
