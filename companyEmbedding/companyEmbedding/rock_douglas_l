Doug Rock










 



 

 

Douglas
        L. Rock  of The Woodlands, TX, is a national leader in
        the energy industry
        and a philanthropic pioneer at Penn State. He also
    attended the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of Business Administration. 
He is president, CEO, and chairman of Smith International,
          Inc., Houston, TX, a supplier of products and services to
          the oil and
        gas exploration and production industry, the petrochemical industry,
          and other industrial markets. Doug has been with Smith International
          since
        1974. Before becoming president in 1987, he served as president of both
        the Smith Tool and the Drilco divisions as well as vice president in
          charge of research and engineering and of manufacturing at Smith Tool.
          He was
        named chief executive officer in 1989 and chairman of the board in 1991.
Doug’s contributions to Smith International
          have been enormous. In 1986 the company faced huge challenges—it
          had declared chapter 11 bankruptcy. Through his leadership
          the company sold some of its holdings and invested in others to regain
          Fortune 500 status. In the
        last 10 years, Smith revenues have risen from $211 million annually
          to $3.6 billion in 2001. In 2001, Smith’s profits exceeded $150
          million and Smith employees numbered 11,500.
Well known for his conscientious and innovative
          approach to business, Doug pursues a vision to drill for oil and gas
          without throwing
        anything
        away—leaving an environmentally responsible "small footprint." Such
        an approach is almost unheard of in those third-world areas where environmental
        regulations are lax. In addition, he has established a worldwide ethics
        hotline for Smith International. Under this successful program, employees
        may call to speak to an ethics officer not employed by the company; he
        wanted employees to feel they had a neutral place where they could air
        grievances, report unethical behavior, or simply ask questions. In addition,
        through Rock’s advocacy, Smith International has contributed significantly
        to engineering science and mechanical research at Penn State.
Doug has received considerable honor for his work
          and was designated as one of Worth magazine’s 50 best CEOS, 2001.
          He is former chairman of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association,
        and is currently vice
        chairman of the American Petroleum Institutes General Membership Committee.
He believes that his education in Liberal Arts
          from Penn State is the cornerstone of his success in the business world.
          As a member
        of both
      the Development Council for the Liberal Arts and that college’s Grand
        Destiny Campaign Committee, he has brought the ethics, insight, and commitment
        for which he is famous in his profession to bear upon University life.
        The College of the Liberal Arts named Rock an Alumni Fellow in 1995.
His $5 million endowment of the Rock Ethics Institute
        at Penn State underscores Doug’s commitment to ethical action.
        The institute will enable faculty to educate students across all disciplines
        in "moral literacy"—a
        concept that encompasses the ability to recognize moral issues, think
        rationally about them, and formulate and critically support responses
        to contemporary
        moral and ethical dilemmas. Rock endowed the institute because he believes
        that Penn State must provide its students not simply with knowledge but
        also develop their wisdom and character. Says Rock, "I hope that
        our work will contribute to a better, more humane world, one in which
        barriers
        between different educational and political spheres are broken down so
        that real dialogues occur."
Doug's family includes wife, Julie, a son, Jason,
          a stepdaughter, Alisson, and three grandchildren.
