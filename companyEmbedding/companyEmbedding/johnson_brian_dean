The Polk County Jail was completed in August of 1999 and has a capacity of 204 inmates.

The Polk County Jail is a state-of-the-art facility which is staffed by the best correctional personnel in the State. During our first State Jail Inspection, the Polk County Jail received an overall rating of 99.8%. This rating is a tribute to all of the hard work and dedication that the staff of the Polk County Jail constantly display.

The Polk County Jail serves many constituencies: the citizens of the County, other criminal justice agencies, the inmate population, staff at the facility, and others who come to the Jail. The Jail has three primary responsibilities to these groups.
