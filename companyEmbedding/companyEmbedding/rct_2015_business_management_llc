REDWOOD CITY, Calif., June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nevro Corp. (NYSE:   NVRO), a global medical device company that is providing innovative evidence-based solutions for the treatment of chronic pain, today announced that Neurosurgery, the official journal of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS), selected the SENZA-RCT 24-month outcomes publication as the journal's Top Pain Paper of the Year.  The SENZA-RCT is a groundbreaking pivotal study that was both the largest prospective randomized clinical trial ever conducted to assess the treatment of chronic back and leg pain, and the first to evaluate comparative effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapies.








Each paper was subject to a rigorous review process with the journal's editorial board, beginning with initial selection from the entire pool of papers published between June 2016 and June 2017.  "The CNS is committed to providing relevant and informative science to our members. This paper delivers on that commitment, and improves our field through innovation. This accomplishment is remarkable and should be celebrated," said Dr. Alan M. Scarrow, CNS President.
Dr. Todd Sitzman first presented the 24-month results of the SENZA-RCT during the 2015 North American Neuromodulation Society (NANS) meeting.  The results showed the sustained superiority of HF10™ therapy versus traditional low-frequency SCS therapy across all primary and secondary endpoints—including pain relief in the back and legs, and functional outcomes at every evaluation point to 24 months. 
The Principal Investigator of the trial, Dr. Leonardo Kapural, from Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, will present the trial results at the 2017 CNS Annual Meeting on Wednesday, October 11, in Boston, MA.  "We are excited to have our manuscript detailing the 24-month outcomes from the SENZA-RCT selected as the Top Pain Paper of the Year," stated Dr. Kapural. "The aim of the study was to provide meaningful longitudinal, comparative evidence that will assist physicians in better evaluating therapies and determining the best course of treatment for their patients suffering from chronic pain.  It is humbling that our work received this prestigious award."
"We are truly honored by this recognition from the prestigious Neurosurgery journal," said Rami Elghandour, President and CEO of Nevro. "We believe comparative, prospective long-term RCTs serve as the cornerstone of advancing patient care.  We sincerely appreciate the editorial board's recognition of the quality of work by Dr. Kapural and the SENZA-RCT investigators for their groundbreaking study.  We are continuing to invest in rigorous RCTs and look forward to increasing support for the field with pragmatic Level I evidence."

Pennsylvania LLC Annual Filing Requirements




Learn about annual report and tax filing requirements for Pennsylvania LLCs.


By David M. Steingold, Contributing Author




Share on Google Plus





Share on Facebook













 





If you want to start and run a Pennsylvania limited liability company (LLC), you'll need to prepare and file various documents with the state. This article covers the most important ongoing reporting and state tax filing requirements for Pennsylvania LLCs.
Annual Registration
Unlike most states, Pennsylvania does not require LLCs to file an annual report. However, Professional Limited Liability Companies (PLLCs) and foreign LLCs engaged in professional services must file a  Certificate of Annual Registration  (Form  DSCB:15-8221/8998)  with the Department of State. These must  be filed with the Corporation Bureau by April 15th of every year. The registration is filed  online  or by postal mail. An annual fee of $520 times the number of members of the LLC must be paid.
State Business Tax
When it comes to income taxes, most LLCs are so-called pass-through tax entities. In other words, the responsibility for paying federal income taxes passes through the LLC itself and falls on the individual LLC members. In most states, LLCs themselves do not pay income taxes, only their members do.
Starting with tax year 2017, Pennsylvania will no longer impose a Capital Stock/Franchise Tax on LLCs or require LLCs to file Form RCT-101 (PA Corporate Tax Report) with the Department of Revenue (DOR). LLCs required to file Form RCT-101 for the 2015 reporting period should mark that return as their final return. Check with the  Department of Revenue  (DOR) for more information.
In some cases, the owners of an LLC choose to have their business treated like a corporation for tax purposes. This choice is made by filing IRS Form 2553 with the IRS. (See the IRS website for the form.) Unlike the default pass-through tax situation, when an LLC elects to be taxed as a corporation, the company itself must file a separate tax return. The State of Pennsylvania, like almost every other state, has a corporation income tax. In Pennsylvania, the corporate tax generally is calculated at a flat 9.99% of taxable income as reported on the business's federal tax return (with adjustments). Use the state's corporation income tax return (Form RCT-101) to pay this tax. For more details, check Nolo’s article,  50-State Guide to Business Income Tax, or the  DOR website.
State Employer Taxes
Does your LLC have employees? If so, you'll need to pay employer taxes. Some of these taxes are paid to the federal government (the IRS) and are not covered here. (But note that federal employer tax obligations start with obtaining a federal  employer identification number  (EIN).) However, Pennsylvania employers also must pay taxes to the state.
First, you'll need to withhold and pay employee income taxes to the DOR. Begin by registering your business with the DOR either  online  or on paper (Form PA-100). Once you've registered, you'll need to file withholding taxes on a periodic basis (for example semi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly) using PA-501 (available via the DOR's online  e-tides system). You'll also need to use some version of Form REV-1667 each year to reconcile your LLC's tax withholding.
In addition, you'll probably need to register to pay state unemployment insurance (UI) taxes. These taxes are handled through Pennsylvania's Department of Labor & Industry (L&I). You can register for these taxes  online  or by using Form PA-100. Then, each quarter, you'll need to report on wages and pay the UI taxes to L&I. For more information, check the  L&I website.
Sales and Use Taxes
If your LLC will sell goods to customers in Pennsylvania, you will need to collect and pay sales tax. This means you'll have to register for this purpose with Department of Revenue and then make periodic sales tax payments for goods sold. You can register  online  or mail in Form PA-100. After you've registered, you'll be sent a PA Sales Tax License. Then, on a periodic basis (for example monthly or quarterly), you must submit sales tax returns to the DOR via the  e-tides  online system. For more information, check the  DOR website.
Registration in Other States
If you will be doing business in states other than Pennsylvania, you may need to register your LLC in some or all of those states. Whether you're required to register will depend on the specific states involved: each state has its own rules for what constitutes doing business and whether registration is necessary. Often activities such as having a physical presence (a business location) in a state, hiring employees in a state, or soliciting business in a state (such as by telephone, print ads, mail, or the Internet) will be considered doing business for registration purposes. Registration usually involves obtaining a certificate of authority or similar document.
For more information on the requirements for forming and operating an LLC in Pennsylvania, see Nolo’s article,  50-State Guide to Forming an LLC,  and other articles on LLCs in the  LLC section  of the Nolo website.

		RCT BRINGS CLASS ACTION AGAINST ADVOCARE	

Reid Collins Tsai has filed a class action lawsuit alleging an over $100 million fraud against Advocare International, LP and its high-level promotors. Advocare is a company that sells shakes, nutritional supplements, and powdered energy drinks. The lawsuit alleges that Advocare operates an illegal pyramid scheme by focusing not on selling products to retail customers, but on endlessly recruiting participants who purchase Advocare products at wholesale prices on an ongoing basis in exchange for the right to receive compensation for recruiting other participants to do the same. According to the lawsuit, Advocare entices people to participate in the scheme with the prospect of large financial rewards when, in fact, hardly any participants make money, the vast majority lose money, and the vast majority of money paid to participants comes from other participants, not retail customers.  The claims made in the complaint, brought on behalf of individuals who lost money participating in the scheme, allege that Advocare’s operation as a pyramid scheme violates both state and federal law, including the Racketeer Influenced & Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.
The lawsuit (Case No. 3:17-cv-00691-B) was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas by RCT partners Adam Swick and Ben King.  If you have lost money selling Advocare products and would like more information, please fill out the information below and someone will contact you.

RCT convinced the court that the insurance company’s attempt to use federal interpleader was—as the court concluded—a “thinly veiled attempt to cap its potential liability” to RCT’s clients. In obtaining this favorable ruling, RCT successfully distinguished two prior Tenth Circuit cases involving similar facts that have been binding precedent for almost 60 years.  See Aviva Life and Annuity Company v. White (In re Millennium Multiple Employer Welfare Benefit Plan), — F.3d —, 2014 WL 6056941 (10th Cir. 2014).

Having the right software for your business needs can mean the difference between getting things done or... having tasks linger, unaddressed, on your to-do list.Unfortunately, most top software companies often focus on larger businesses, rather than small enterprises. As a result, many of their solutions are either unaffordable or loaded with features smaller companies don't need.Not all software is this way. More and more, software providers are offering small business versions of their enterprise solutions or are targeting the small business market with programs uniquely designed to meet its needs. If you're in the market for a new tool, here are a few of the top small business software solutions to consider in 2015.AccountingIf you're like most entrepreneurs, chances are you're good at what you do--but significantly less practiced at the administrative side of running a business. But whether you're knowledgeable or not, needs like accounting must be taken care of. Any of the following tools will help get your books in order, whether you do so in order to manage your own finances or to pass your information on to your CPA.QuickBooksOne of the most recognized names in small business accounting, QuickBooks offers both desktop and online versions (depending on the needs of your company and the experience of your team members), you may prefer one over the other. Regardless of the option you choose, Quickbooks is reasonably affordable, though taking full advantage of the program does require a bit of training.As an added bonus, most accounting firms are experienced with QuickBooks. If you plan to seek outside support for your business's finances, give this program a shot, as its widespread familiarity will make transmitting your data to your accountant a snap.FreshBooksIf QuickBooks proves to be a bit of an overkill for your startup's needs, check out FreshBooks. This cloud-based accounting software program is easier to use than QuickBooks and supports over 50 integrations--including payroll and email programs. FreshBooks features a 30 days free trial and subscription-based pricing from $19.95 per month up to $39.95 per month after this period.Wave AccountingAnother cloud-based accounting tool, Wave Accounting has been named the best free accounting software for small businesses by Business News Daily. It's important to note that Wave is for very small businesses--in particular, companies with fewer than 10 staff members will get the most out of this QuickBooks alternative. That said, it provides excellent functionality for free, with free user forums for support or live support packages starting at $9 per month if your needs are more complex.Human ResourcesScaling your startup by bringing on employees is a major milestone for small businesses. But despite the game-changing nature of this step forward, few entrepreneurs take the time to fully address their human resources needs or to implement the HR technologies that can streamline these systems.Instead of letting your human resources needs get out of control as you expand, put one of the following tools into place as soon as possible:ZenefitsThis all-in one human resource software program gives you access to benefits management, payroll processing, onboarding tools and more. Even better, many Zenefits features can be set to run automatically after your initial configuration, significantly reducing the amount of time you need to spend on these tasks on an ongoing basis.As an added bonus, if your small business uses contractors rather than--or in addition to--regular employees, Zenefits makes it easy to manage their details as well, allowing you to track their compensation and handle their tax needs from within a single program.BambooHRLike Zenifits, BambooHR is a cloud-based HR system that's simple interface and intuitive design make it a great fit for small and medium sized businesses. Although the program is exclusively an online human resource information system, it does integrate with other payroll solutions or applicant tracking software, giving you easy access from one central dashboard.sumHRFinally, sumHR is a great small business HR software program that focuses on attendance, leave, and payroll functions. If you're looking to take your employee directory out of the spreadsheets and into a professional program, sumHR may be the solution for you. The company is also planning on adding new features soon, including reporting and performance reviews, making it one to watch into the future.SchedulingPlenty of small businesses have scheduling concerns to deal with, whether yours come in the form of hourly workers or customer appointments to be booked. But despite the widespread nature of this problem, many of these companies still rely on outdated pen and paper scheduling books which are both time-consuming to manage and vulnerable to human error.There's got to be a better way--and there is! Check out any of the following programs for your scheduling needs:When I WorkScheduling staff hours doesn't have to be difficult--When I Work makes the process intuitive and simple, helping to reduce absences and avoid employee miscommunications. When I Work offers mobile accessibility so that staff can see their schedules, trade shifts among themselves and request time off while on-the-go. The program's pricing comes as a monthly subscription fee that's based on the number of staff you manage--up to 20 staff can be scheduled for $29 per month.BookerIf you have clients that need to make appointments or you offer classes that your customers need to sign up for, Booker makes it easy. Once installed, you can attract customers from your website or social media profile and bring them to a central site where they can then book appointments. The site is optimized for mobile users, making it easy to build relationships with clients through the program's provided messaging and retention tools.GenbookAnother solution for online booking, Genbook allows your customers to book appointments while also giving you the tools needed to manage your business, staff, and reputation.

Data with a Big Story


Commercial properties are built
on a foundation of data. But if you’re only looking at the numbers from your
own building, you’re not getting the whole story. Without context, these facts
and figures—rental rates, operating expenses, fixed expenses—don’t tell you
much about how well your building is operating in comparison to its
competition. BOMA International’s Experience Exchange
Reports give you the context you need to make data-driven
decisions that will affect your bottom line.


The just-released 2017 Office
EER and Industrial EER are the commercial real estate industry’s most
comprehensive and accurate benchmarking resources for the office and industrial
sectors. Use the detailed income, expense and occupancy information from thousands
of properties across hundreds of markets to evaluate your building’s
operations, identify opportunities for cost savings, build better budgets,
discover market trends and more. With the interactive functionality of these
online reports, you can sort by multiple building parameters and by countless
line items to drill down to exactly the information you need to help your
property succeed.


Put the industry’s most
powerful business tool to work for you. Subscribe to the Office EER and
Industrial EER now at eer.boma.org.

BOMA Launches Water and Waste Challenge
The 2017 BOMA International Conference & Expo featured the official launch of BOMA International's W2 Challenge, a two-year initiative to encourage commercial real estate professionals to benchmark water and waste consumption and improve performance. With the support of a generous grant from Yardi and in partnership with BOMA local associations, BOMA International is proud to launch the new challenge to highlight and expand the sustainability efforts of the commercial real estate industry. The program will use ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager, which is already a popular tool for tracking energy use. The first year of the challenge will establish a baseline of water and waste consumption and costs, and the second year will promote performance improvements. Participants will receive progress reports, as well as guidance and best practices from BOMA and industry partners, and will be eligible for recognition for their leadership.
The challenge runs from January 1, 2018, through the end of 2019, but make a commitment now so you'll have the details you need to be ready at the start of the program. Visit www.boma.org/W2 to sign up and take your sustainability efforts to the next level.​

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
