Personal Prestige IMMA
New money only. A minimum $25,000 balance and a Chemung Canal checking account are required to open the account. No interest is earned on daily ledger balances under $1,000. The Personal Prestige IMMA is a variable interest rate/yield personal money market account and is subject to change at any time. Fees can reduce earnings on the account.
All Accounts Mentioned Above
We use the daily ledger balance method to calculate interest on your account. This method applies a daily periodic rate to the ledger balance in the account each day. All deposited checks begin to earn interest as soon as we receive credit for the checks from the Federal Reserve Bank. For exact availability of funds for all checks, refer to our “Availability of Funds” disclosure, which is given to you at the time the account is opened, or may be obtained at any time from one of our client service representatives.
Each day, the daily ledger balance is multiplied by the interest rate and divided by 365 days (Example: a daily ledger balance of $2,500 x rate of 2.00%/365 days would equal 13.7 cents accrued interest for the day.) The accrued interest for each day is added together and credited to the account each month.

Chemung Canal Trust Company, a Shaw Systems COLLECTIONS client since 1995, has experienced improved performance and low delinquency rates while using the product.
Resource Recovery manager for Chemung Canal Trust Company, Dave Wakeman, and his staff of 4 collectors are frequently acknowledged at the bank’s officer meetings for their excellent performance. Their average delinquency rate for the quarter ending 6/30/03 was .71%. The New York Bankers Association (NYBA) reports average delinquency for the same quarter at 1.97% for similar-size banks. 
Wakeman said, “The COLLECTIONS system plays a crucial role in managing past due accounts and keeping the delinquency well below industry standards.”
Wakeman is also pleased with the exceptional support from Shaw, especially the help he’s received from Marcus Ebenhack and Paul DeMarsh.
