About





They say home is where the heart is.

But what is home? To us, home is more than a roof over your head. It's the community we live in. It's family and friends and a familiar face. It's the memory of simpler times. Home is where we feel most comfortable and where we always feel welcome. It's where we belong and it makes us who we are.





The first Casey's opened in July 1968

The very first Casey's General Store was a converted three-bay garage that opened in Boone, Iowa in July of 1968. At the time, the population of Boone was around 12,468. The Casey's store carried a limited list of products — two kinds of gasoline, common grocery items and 10-cent cups of coffee.





In towns across America

There's a Casey's waiting for you with:


A warm smile.
Some good conversation.
A hot cup of joe.
A fresh donut.


A hot and ready sandwich.
A cold drink.
A famous handmade pizza.
Or whatever you need.







In 1985 famous homemade pizza is introduced.

In Waukee, Iowa, Casey's famous homemade pizza is introduced. And it quickly becomes a favorite in towns all over the Midwest. Now Casey's is the 5th largest pizza chain in the US, and people come from all over to experience Casey's famous pizza. Today, there are over 19 million pizzas made each year, and Casey's is the 4th largest convenience store chain.

Connecting in communities
Casey’s General Stores, Inc. believes giving back to the communities where we live and work is one of our core values. With a diverse variety of fundraising activities, Casey’s and its stores contributed more than $4.5 million last year to many community and charitable organizations and events. We receive hundreds of contribution requests each week; therefore, requests must be received at least 20 business days prior to the date of your event. Those communities where we have stores within our 15-state area will be the recipients of our charity dollars. Unfortunately, it is not possible to honor all requests even though most are very worthwhile causes. Organizations are asked to limit their requests to one per calendar year. Due to the high volume of requests we receive, the following guidelines below will be followed.
Request a donation online |  Request a donation online
Request Eligibility (Restrictions):
Casey’s General Stores, Inc. does not provide contributions to:

Individuals seeking assistance for trips, including school sponsored events
Research projects, assessments or special studies
Adult sport teams
Scholarships
Pageants
Educational attendance or behavior rewards

Request Process:
We require a Contribution Request Form to be filled out online in its entirety. Organizations seeking a multi-year pledge or high dollar contribution will need to include the total cost of the project and how much money has been raised thus far. Casey’s prefers that communities raise at least 60 percent of their total funding before soliciting a contribution from us.
Guidelines:
All requests must follow the guidelines listed below to receive serious consideration:

Request must be submitted at least 20 business days prior to the date for which the donation is needed.
Request must be submitted online only. All requests must be received on the Form provided.
E-mail and telephone requests will not be given any consideration.
Submit one request regardless of whether you wish to receive donations from several store locations.
Due to the high volume of requests we receive, refrain from calling the Corporate Headquarters or our stores to check on the status of a previously requested donation.
Checks will only be made payable to organizations and events, not individuals.
All requests, whether approved or declined, will be responded to in timely fashion assuming complete contact information is included on the request.

Casey's General Stores, Inc., is a chain of convenience stores in the Midwestern United States, primarily within the states of Arkansas, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. The company is headquartered in Ankeny, Iowa; a suburb of Des Moines.

History[edit]
In 1959, Donald Lamberti leased a service station in Des Moines, Iowa, from his father. After successfully remodeling the station into a convenience store and operating it for nine years, his gasoline supplier and friend, Kurvin C. (K.C.) Fish, suggested that he purchase the Square Deal Oil Company, a service station available for sale in Boone, Iowa. Lamberti followed Fish's advice and purchased the station, which he renamed "Casey's" after Fish and as with his leased store converted the station into a convenience store. The logo on the Boone store is the same logo used today by the Casey's chain.
The Boone store (located in a town of only 12,500) did well, so Lamberti decided to see if he could duplicate his success. He built another store in Creston, Iowa (population 7,000) and that store did well also. Lamberti became more ambitious and decided to open a store from scratch in the even smaller town of Waukee, Iowa (population 1,500 at the time). The Waukee store proved to be the most successful of the three, so Lamberti decided to purchase and open more stores, concentrating on towns of less than 5,000 population (a variation on the tactic used in the early success of Wal-Mart).
1970s–1990s[edit]
By the late 1970s (when Casey's opened its first warehouse) the chain had 118 stores, including the original store operated by Lamberti's parents which entered the Casey's fold in 1977.
In 1982, Casey's opened its first Distribution Center in Urbandale, Iowa.
Casey's became a publicly traded company in October, 1983, with an initial public offering of 700,000 shares. Around this time Casey's began to sell doughnuts in its stores; in December 1984 it introduced pizza into its stores (which is one of its signature items today).
In 1990, Casey's moved to its current facility in Ankeny, Iowa.
Casey's 1,000th store opened in Altoona, Iowa in 1996, the same year Casey's exceeded US $1 billion in annual sales.
2000–present[edit]
In January 2006, Casey's purchased Lincoln, Nebraska-based Gas 'N Shop.[2] On August 7, 2006, Casey's agreed to purchase the 33-store HandiMart chain, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a $63 million deal.[3]
In March 2010, Alimentation Couche-Tard (operator of several convenience store chains, including Circle K) offered $1.9 billion for control of the company, and later announced a proxy fight for control. Casey's rejected Couche-Tard's offer and was successful in September 2010 in retaining its board of directors vs. Couche-Tard's nominated slate.[4]
While Casey's and Couche-Tard were battling for company control, in September 2010, 7-Eleven offered a $2 billion bid for control of the company. Casey's and 7-Eleven engaged in discussions, but in November 2010 elected not to proceed with a merger.[5]
Casey's announced in 2017 that it plans to open about 10 new locations in western Ohio.[6]
Recent expansions[edit]

On October 12, 2010, Casey's announced the planned purchase of 19 "On The Way" stores in Illinois owned by Harper Oil Company, to be completed by November 2010 (Harper retained other stores and the On The Way name).[7]
On October 28, 2010, Casey's announced the purchase of six "Short Stop" stores in Iowa owned by J.D. Carpenter Companies, Inc.[8]
On November 3, 2010, Casey's announced the purchase of 44 "Kabredlo's" stores.[9] The purchase, expected to be completed by December 2010, would include 22 stores in Nebraska, 21 in Kansas, and the first Casey's location to operate in the state of Oklahoma.
On March 28, 2011, a Casey's General Store opened in Bella Vista, Arkansas, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
Casey's further solidified its Iowa base in June 2011 with the announced purchase of twenty-two Kum & Go stores in Iowa, bringing its total store number in the state to 473. At least for the time being, the Kum & Go stores will remain in the current buildings but be rebranded with signage.[10]
On August 2, 2012, a Casey's General Store opened in Cadiz, Kentucky, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
On April 11, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Mountain Home, Arkansas.
Casey's is also present in Tennessee, with a store in Dyersburg, Tennessee.
On September 5, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in DeSoto, Kansas, making it the third Casey's in Kansas City.
On October 1, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Horace, North Dakota, the chain's first store to operate in that state. Later acquisitions of the Fargo-based Stop n Go in 2014 expanded the chain in North Dakota.
On August 28, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Mayfield, Kentucky, only the chain's second store to operate in that state.
On August 21, 2014, a Casey's General Store opened in Clarksville, Arkansas.
On March 20, 2017, a Casey's General Store opened in Cridersville, Ohio, the first store to operate in the state.[11]

History[edit]
In 1959, Donald Lamberti leased a service station in Des Moines, Iowa, from his father. After successfully remodeling the station into a convenience store and operating it for nine years, his gasoline supplier and friend, Kurvin C. (K.C.) Fish, suggested that he purchase the Square Deal Oil Company, a service station available for sale in Boone, Iowa. Lamberti followed Fish's advice and purchased the station, which he renamed "Casey's" after Fish and as with his leased store converted the station into a convenience store. The logo on the Boone store is the same logo used today by the Casey's chain.
The Boone store (located in a town of only 12,500) did well, so Lamberti decided to see if he could duplicate his success. He built another store in Creston, Iowa (population 7,000) and that store did well also. Lamberti became more ambitious and decided to open a store from scratch in the even smaller town of Waukee, Iowa (population 1,500 at the time). The Waukee store proved to be the most successful of the three, so Lamberti decided to purchase and open more stores, concentrating on towns of less than 5,000 population (a variation on the tactic used in the early success of Wal-Mart).
1970s–1990s[edit]
By the late 1970s (when Casey's opened its first warehouse) the chain had 118 stores, including the original store operated by Lamberti's parents which entered the Casey's fold in 1977.
In 1982, Casey's opened its first Distribution Center in Urbandale, Iowa.
Casey's became a publicly traded company in October, 1983, with an initial public offering of 700,000 shares. Around this time Casey's began to sell doughnuts in its stores; in December 1984 it introduced pizza into its stores (which is one of its signature items today).
In 1990, Casey's moved to its current facility in Ankeny, Iowa.
Casey's 1,000th store opened in Altoona, Iowa in 1996, the same year Casey's exceeded US $1 billion in annual sales.
2000–present[edit]
In January 2006, Casey's purchased Lincoln, Nebraska-based Gas 'N Shop.[2] On August 7, 2006, Casey's agreed to purchase the 33-store HandiMart chain, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a $63 million deal.[3]
In March 2010, Alimentation Couche-Tard (operator of several convenience store chains, including Circle K) offered $1.9 billion for control of the company, and later announced a proxy fight for control. Casey's rejected Couche-Tard's offer and was successful in September 2010 in retaining its board of directors vs. Couche-Tard's nominated slate.[4]
While Casey's and Couche-Tard were battling for company control, in September 2010, 7-Eleven offered a $2 billion bid for control of the company. Casey's and 7-Eleven engaged in discussions, but in November 2010 elected not to proceed with a merger.[5]
Casey's announced in 2017 that it plans to open about 10 new locations in western Ohio.[6]
Recent expansions[edit]

On October 12, 2010, Casey's announced the planned purchase of 19 "On The Way" stores in Illinois owned by Harper Oil Company, to be completed by November 2010 (Harper retained other stores and the On The Way name).[7]
On October 28, 2010, Casey's announced the purchase of six "Short Stop" stores in Iowa owned by J.D. Carpenter Companies, Inc.[8]
On November 3, 2010, Casey's announced the purchase of 44 "Kabredlo's" stores.[9] The purchase, expected to be completed by December 2010, would include 22 stores in Nebraska, 21 in Kansas, and the first Casey's location to operate in the state of Oklahoma.
On March 28, 2011, a Casey's General Store opened in Bella Vista, Arkansas, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
Casey's further solidified its Iowa base in June 2011 with the announced purchase of twenty-two Kum & Go stores in Iowa, bringing its total store number in the state to 473. At least for the time being, the Kum & Go stores will remain in the current buildings but be rebranded with signage.[10]
On August 2, 2012, a Casey's General Store opened in Cadiz, Kentucky, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
On April 11, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Mountain Home, Arkansas.
Casey's is also present in Tennessee, with a store in Dyersburg, Tennessee.
On September 5, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in DeSoto, Kansas, making it the third Casey's in Kansas City.
On October 1, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Horace, North Dakota, the chain's first store to operate in that state. Later acquisitions of the Fargo-based Stop n Go in 2014 expanded the chain in North Dakota.
On August 28, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Mayfield, Kentucky, only the chain's second store to operate in that state.
On August 21, 2014, a Casey's General Store opened in Clarksville, Arkansas.
On March 20, 2017, a Casey's General Store opened in Cridersville, Ohio, the first store to operate in the state.[11]

History[edit]
In 1959, Donald Lamberti leased a service station in Des Moines, Iowa, from his father. After successfully remodeling the station into a convenience store and operating it for nine years, his gasoline supplier and friend, Kurvin C. (K.C.) Fish, suggested that he purchase the Square Deal Oil Company, a service station available for sale in Boone, Iowa. Lamberti followed Fish's advice and purchased the station, which he renamed "Casey's" after Fish and as with his leased store converted the station into a convenience store. The logo on the Boone store is the same logo used today by the Casey's chain.
The Boone store (located in a town of only 12,500) did well, so Lamberti decided to see if he could duplicate his success. He built another store in Creston, Iowa (population 7,000) and that store did well also. Lamberti became more ambitious and decided to open a store from scratch in the even smaller town of Waukee, Iowa (population 1,500 at the time). The Waukee store proved to be the most successful of the three, so Lamberti decided to purchase and open more stores, concentrating on towns of less than 5,000 population (a variation on the tactic used in the early success of Wal-Mart).
1970s–1990s[edit]
By the late 1970s (when Casey's opened its first warehouse) the chain had 118 stores, including the original store operated by Lamberti's parents which entered the Casey's fold in 1977.
In 1982, Casey's opened its first Distribution Center in Urbandale, Iowa.
Casey's became a publicly traded company in October, 1983, with an initial public offering of 700,000 shares. Around this time Casey's began to sell doughnuts in its stores; in December 1984 it introduced pizza into its stores (which is one of its signature items today).
In 1990, Casey's moved to its current facility in Ankeny, Iowa.
Casey's 1,000th store opened in Altoona, Iowa in 1996, the same year Casey's exceeded US $1 billion in annual sales.
2000–present[edit]
In January 2006, Casey's purchased Lincoln, Nebraska-based Gas 'N Shop.[2] On August 7, 2006, Casey's agreed to purchase the 33-store HandiMart chain, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a $63 million deal.[3]
In March 2010, Alimentation Couche-Tard (operator of several convenience store chains, including Circle K) offered $1.9 billion for control of the company, and later announced a proxy fight for control. Casey's rejected Couche-Tard's offer and was successful in September 2010 in retaining its board of directors vs. Couche-Tard's nominated slate.[4]
While Casey's and Couche-Tard were battling for company control, in September 2010, 7-Eleven offered a $2 billion bid for control of the company. Casey's and 7-Eleven engaged in discussions, but in November 2010 elected not to proceed with a merger.[5]
Casey's announced in 2017 that it plans to open about 10 new locations in western Ohio.[6]
Recent expansions[edit]

On October 12, 2010, Casey's announced the planned purchase of 19 "On The Way" stores in Illinois owned by Harper Oil Company, to be completed by November 2010 (Harper retained other stores and the On The Way name).[7]
On October 28, 2010, Casey's announced the purchase of six "Short Stop" stores in Iowa owned by J.D. Carpenter Companies, Inc.[8]
On November 3, 2010, Casey's announced the purchase of 44 "Kabredlo's" stores.[9] The purchase, expected to be completed by December 2010, would include 22 stores in Nebraska, 21 in Kansas, and the first Casey's location to operate in the state of Oklahoma.
On March 28, 2011, a Casey's General Store opened in Bella Vista, Arkansas, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
Casey's further solidified its Iowa base in June 2011 with the announced purchase of twenty-two Kum & Go stores in Iowa, bringing its total store number in the state to 473. At least for the time being, the Kum & Go stores will remain in the current buildings but be rebranded with signage.[10]
On August 2, 2012, a Casey's General Store opened in Cadiz, Kentucky, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
On April 11, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Mountain Home, Arkansas.
Casey's is also present in Tennessee, with a store in Dyersburg, Tennessee.
On September 5, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in DeSoto, Kansas, making it the third Casey's in Kansas City.
On October 1, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Horace, North Dakota, the chain's first store to operate in that state. Later acquisitions of the Fargo-based Stop n Go in 2014 expanded the chain in North Dakota.
On August 28, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Mayfield, Kentucky, only the chain's second store to operate in that state.
On August 21, 2014, a Casey's General Store opened in Clarksville, Arkansas.
On March 20, 2017, a Casey's General Store opened in Cridersville, Ohio, the first store to operate in the state.[11]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

About





They say home is where the heart is.

But what is home? To us, home is more than a roof over your head. It's the community we live in. It's family and friends and a familiar face. It's the memory of simpler times. Home is where we feel most comfortable and where we always feel welcome. It's where we belong and it makes us who we are.





The first Casey's opened in July 1968

The very first Casey's General Store was a converted three-bay garage that opened in Boone, Iowa in July of 1968. At the time, the population of Boone was around 12,468. The Casey's store carried a limited list of products — two kinds of gasoline, common grocery items and 10-cent cups of coffee.





In towns across America

There's a Casey's waiting for you with:


A warm smile.
Some good conversation.
A hot cup of joe.
A fresh donut.


A hot and ready sandwich.
A cold drink.
A famous handmade pizza.
Or whatever you need.







In 1985 famous homemade pizza is introduced.

In Waukee, Iowa, Casey's famous homemade pizza is introduced. And it quickly becomes a favorite in towns all over the Midwest. Now Casey's is the 5th largest pizza chain in the US, and people come from all over to experience Casey's famous pizza. Today, there are over 19 million pizzas made each year, and Casey's is the 4th largest convenience store chain.

History[edit]
In 1959, Donald Lamberti leased a service station in Des Moines, Iowa, from his father. After successfully remodeling the station into a convenience store and operating it for nine years, his gasoline supplier and friend, Kurvin C. (K.C.) Fish, suggested that he purchase the Square Deal Oil Company, a service station available for sale in Boone, Iowa. Lamberti followed Fish's advice and purchased the station, which he renamed "Casey's" after Fish and as with his leased store converted the station into a convenience store. The logo on the Boone store is the same logo used today by the Casey's chain.
The Boone store (located in a town of only 12,500) did well, so Lamberti decided to see if he could duplicate his success. He built another store in Creston, Iowa (population 7,000) and that store did well also. Lamberti became more ambitious and decided to open a store from scratch in the even smaller town of Waukee, Iowa (population 1,500 at the time). The Waukee store proved to be the most successful of the three, so Lamberti decided to purchase and open more stores, concentrating on towns of less than 5,000 population (a variation on the tactic used in the early success of Wal-Mart).
1970s–1990s[edit]
By the late 1970s (when Casey's opened its first warehouse) the chain had 118 stores, including the original store operated by Lamberti's parents which entered the Casey's fold in 1977.
In 1982, Casey's opened its first Distribution Center in Urbandale, Iowa.
Casey's became a publicly traded company in October, 1983, with an initial public offering of 700,000 shares. Around this time Casey's began to sell doughnuts in its stores; in December 1984 it introduced pizza into its stores (which is one of its signature items today).
In 1990, Casey's moved to its current facility in Ankeny, Iowa.
Casey's 1,000th store opened in Altoona, Iowa in 1996, the same year Casey's exceeded US $1 billion in annual sales.
2000–present[edit]
In January 2006, Casey's purchased Lincoln, Nebraska-based Gas 'N Shop.[2] On August 7, 2006, Casey's agreed to purchase the 33-store HandiMart chain, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a $63 million deal.[3]
In March 2010, Alimentation Couche-Tard (operator of several convenience store chains, including Circle K) offered $1.9 billion for control of the company, and later announced a proxy fight for control. Casey's rejected Couche-Tard's offer and was successful in September 2010 in retaining its board of directors vs. Couche-Tard's nominated slate.[4]
While Casey's and Couche-Tard were battling for company control, in September 2010, 7-Eleven offered a $2 billion bid for control of the company. Casey's and 7-Eleven engaged in discussions, but in November 2010 elected not to proceed with a merger.[5]
Casey's announced in 2017 that it plans to open about 10 new locations in western Ohio.[6]
Recent expansions[edit]

On October 12, 2010, Casey's announced the planned purchase of 19 "On The Way" stores in Illinois owned by Harper Oil Company, to be completed by November 2010 (Harper retained other stores and the On The Way name).[7]
On October 28, 2010, Casey's announced the purchase of six "Short Stop" stores in Iowa owned by J.D. Carpenter Companies, Inc.[8]
On November 3, 2010, Casey's announced the purchase of 44 "Kabredlo's" stores.[9] The purchase, expected to be completed by December 2010, would include 22 stores in Nebraska, 21 in Kansas, and the first Casey's location to operate in the state of Oklahoma.
On March 28, 2011, a Casey's General Store opened in Bella Vista, Arkansas, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
Casey's further solidified its Iowa base in June 2011 with the announced purchase of twenty-two Kum & Go stores in Iowa, bringing its total store number in the state to 473. At least for the time being, the Kum & Go stores will remain in the current buildings but be rebranded with signage.[10]
On August 2, 2012, a Casey's General Store opened in Cadiz, Kentucky, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
On April 11, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Mountain Home, Arkansas.

On September 5, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in DeSoto, Kansas, making it the third Casey's in Kansas City.
On October 1, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Horace, North Dakota, the chain's first store to operate in that state. Later acquisitions of the Fargo-based Stop n Go in 2014 expanded the chain in North Dakota.
On August 28, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Mayfield, Kentucky, only the chain's second store to operate in that state.
On August 21, 2014, a Casey's General Store opened in Clarksville, Arkansas.

About





They say home is where the heart is.

But what is home? To us, home is more than a roof over your head. It's the community we live in. It's family and friends and a familiar face. It's the memory of simpler times. Home is where we feel most comfortable and where we always feel welcome. It's where we belong and it makes us who we are.





The first Casey's opened in July 1968

The very first Casey's General Store was a converted three-bay garage that opened in Boone, Iowa in July of 1968. At the time, the population of Boone was around 12,468. The Casey's store carried a limited list of products — two kinds of gasoline, common grocery items and 10-cent cups of coffee.





In towns across America

There's a Casey's waiting for you with:


A warm smile.
Some good conversation.
A hot cup of joe.
A fresh donut.


A hot and ready sandwich.
A cold drink.
A famous handmade pizza.
Or whatever you need.







In 1985 famous homemade pizza is introduced.

In Waukee, Iowa, Casey's famous homemade pizza is introduced. And it quickly becomes a favorite in towns all over the Midwest. Now Casey's is the 5th largest pizza chain in the US, and people come from all over to experience Casey's famous pizza. Today, there are over 19 million pizzas made each year, and Casey's is the 4th largest convenience store chain.





Home is where there's a Casey's



A community gathering place
A mom-and-pop shop
A gas station


A pizza parlor
A bakery
A convenience store

History[edit]
In 1959, Donald Lamberti leased a service station in Des Moines, Iowa, from his father. After successfully remodeling the station into a convenience store and operating it for nine years, his gasoline supplier and friend, Kurvin C. (K.C.) Fish, suggested that he purchase the Square Deal Oil Company, a service station available for sale in Boone, Iowa. Lamberti followed Fish's advice and purchased the station, which he renamed "Casey's" after Fish and as with his leased store converted the station into a convenience store. The logo on the Boone store is the same logo used today by the Casey's chain.
The Boone store (located in a town of only 12,500) did well, so Lamberti decided to see if he could duplicate his success. He built another store in Creston, Iowa (population 7,000) and that store did well also. Lamberti became more ambitious and decided to open a store from scratch in the even smaller town of Waukee, Iowa (population 1,500 at the time). The Waukee store proved to be the most successful of the three, so Lamberti decided to purchase and open more stores, concentrating on towns of less than 5,000 population (a variation on the tactic used in the early success of Wal-Mart).
1970s–1990s[edit]
By the late 1970s (when Casey's opened its first warehouse) the chain had 118 stores, including the original store operated by Lamberti's parents which entered the Casey's fold in 1977.
In 1982, Casey's opened its first Distribution Center in Urbandale, Iowa.
Casey's became a publicly traded company in October, 1983, with an initial public offering of 700,000 shares. Around this time Casey's began to sell doughnuts in its stores; in December 1984 it introduced pizza into its stores (which is one of its signature items today).
In 1990, Casey's moved to its current facility in Ankeny, Iowa.
Casey's 1,000th store opened in Altoona, Iowa in 1996, the same year Casey's exceeded US $1 billion in annual sales.
2000–present[edit]
In January 2006, Casey's purchased Lincoln, Nebraska-based Gas 'N Shop.[2] On August 7, 2006, Casey's agreed to purchase the 33-store HandiMart chain, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a $63 million deal.[3]
In March 2010, Alimentation Couche-Tard (operator of several convenience store chains, including Circle K) offered $1.9 billion for control of the company, and later announced a proxy fight for control. Casey's rejected Couche-Tard's offer and was successful in September 2010 in retaining its board of directors vs. Couche-Tard's nominated slate.[4]
While Casey's and Couche-Tard were battling for company control, in September 2010, 7-Eleven offered a $2 billion bid for control of the company. Casey's and 7-Eleven engaged in discussions, but in November 2010 elected not to proceed with a merger.[5]
Casey's announced in 2017 that it plans to open about 10 new locations in western Ohio.[6]
Recent expansions[edit]

On March 28, 2011, a Casey's General Store opened in Bella Vista, Arkansas, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
Casey's further solidified its Iowa base in June 2011 with the announced purchase of twenty-two Kum & Go stores in Iowa, bringing its total store number in the state to 473. At least for the time being, the Kum & Go stores will remain in the current buildings but be rebranded with signage.[10]
On August 2, 2012, a Casey's General Store opened in Cadiz, Kentucky, the chain's first store to operate in that state.

Casey's General Stores, Inc., is a chain of convenience stores in the Midwestern United States, primarily within the states of Arkansas, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.

History[edit]
In 1959, Donald Lamberti leased a service station in Des Moines, Iowa, from his father. After successfully remodeling the station into a convenience store and operating it for nine years, his gasoline supplier and friend, Kurvin C. (K.C.) Fish, suggested that he purchase the Square Deal Oil Company, a service station available for sale in Boone, Iowa. Lamberti followed Fish's advice and purchased the station, which he renamed "Casey's" after Fish and as with his leased store converted the station into a convenience store. The logo on the Boone store is the same logo used today by the Casey's chain.
The Boone store (located in a town of only 12,500) did well, so Lamberti decided to see if he could duplicate his success. He built another store in Creston, Iowa (population 7,000) and that store did well also. Lamberti became more ambitious and decided to open a store from scratch in the even smaller town of Waukee, Iowa (population 1,500 at the time). The Waukee store proved to be the most successful of the three, so Lamberti decided to purchase and open more stores, concentrating on towns of less than 5,000 population (a variation on the tactic used in the early success of Wal-Mart).
1970s–1990s[edit]
By the late 1970s (when Casey's opened its first warehouse) the chain had 118 stores, including the original store operated by Lamberti's parents which entered the Casey's fold in 1977.
In 1982, Casey's opened its first Distribution Center in Urbandale, Iowa.
Casey's became a publicly traded company in October, 1983, with an initial public offering of 700,000 shares. Around this time Casey's began to sell doughnuts in its stores; in December 1984 it introduced pizza into its stores (which is one of its signature items today).
In 1990, Casey's moved to its current facility in Ankeny, Iowa.
Casey's 1,000th store opened in Altoona, Iowa in 1996, the same year Casey's exceeded US $1 billion in annual sales.
2000–present[edit]
In January 2006, Casey's purchased Lincoln, Nebraska-based Gas 'N Shop.[2] On August 7, 2006, Casey's agreed to purchase the 33-store HandiMart chain, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a $63 million deal.[3]
In March 2010, Alimentation Couche-Tard (operator of several convenience store chains, including Circle K) offered $1.9 billion for control of the company, and later announced a proxy fight for control. Casey's rejected Couche-Tard's offer and was successful in September 2010 in retaining its board of directors vs. Couche-Tard's nominated slate.[4]
While Casey's and Couche-Tard were battling for company control, in September 2010, 7-Eleven offered a $2 billion bid for control of the company. Casey's and 7-Eleven engaged in discussions, but in November 2010 elected not to proceed with a merger.[5]
Casey's announced in 2017 that it plans to open about 10 new locations in western Ohio.[6]
Recent expansions[edit]

On October 12, 2010, Casey's announced the planned purchase of 19 "On The Way" stores in Illinois owned by Harper Oil Company, to be completed by November 2010 (Harper retained other stores and the On The Way name).[7]
On October 28, 2010, Casey's announced the purchase of six "Short Stop" stores in Iowa owned by J.D. Carpenter Companies, Inc.[8]
On November 3, 2010, Casey's announced the purchase of 44 "Kabredlo's" stores.[9] The purchase, expected to be completed by December 2010, would include 22 stores in Nebraska, 21 in Kansas, and the first Casey's location to operate in the state of Oklahoma.
On March 28, 2011, a Casey's General Store opened in Bella Vista, Arkansas, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
Casey's further solidified its Iowa base in June 2011 with the announced purchase of twenty-two Kum & Go stores in Iowa, bringing its total store number in the state to 473. At least for the time being, the Kum & Go stores will remain in the current buildings but be rebranded with signage.[10]
On August 2, 2012, a Casey's General Store opened in Cadiz, Kentucky, the chain's first store to operate in that state.
On April 11, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Mountain Home, Arkansas.
Casey's is also present in Tennessee, with a store in Dyersburg, Tennessee.
On September 5, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in DeSoto, Kansas, making it the third Casey's in Kansas City.
On October 1, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Horace, North Dakota, the chain's first store to operate in that state. Later acquisitions of the Fargo-based Stop n Go in 2014 expanded the chain in North Dakota.
On August 28, 2013, a Casey's General Store opened in Mayfield, Kentucky, only the chain's second store to operate in that state.
On August 21, 2014, a Casey's General Store opened in Clarksville, Arkansas.
On March 20, 2017, a Casey's General Store opened in Cridersville, Ohio, the first store to operate in the state.[11]

Casey's today[edit]




A Casey's General Store located in the Amana Colonies, Iowa which complies with 'spare signage' and building aesthetics ordinances for that area.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
