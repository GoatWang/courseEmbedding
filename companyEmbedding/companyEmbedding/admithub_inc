It then works with accepted students at that school to help them navigate orientation, get financial aid, sign up for classes, and apply for housing. In 2016, AdmitHub teamed up with Georgia State University to help guide students through the transition to college. Georgia State saw an 11% increase in freshman enrollment and a 4.5% drop in the summer “melt” rate (the difference in students who accepted an offer of admission but didn’t show up for class in the fall) in the first year of the partnership.Awards2017: EducationAdmitHub On The WebWebsiteRead MoreadvertisementadvertisementIdeasIdeasSam Adams Tries To Raise Up Craft Brewing By Supporting The CompetitionIdeasRick Perry Is Fighting Historical Forces In The Energy Market–He’s Going To LoseIdeasThis New Documentary Shows The Struggle To Help People Coming Home From PrisonEntertainmentEntertainmentInside The Dumbest First Amendment Battle Of 2017EntertainmentJulia Michaels Is Exactly What Pop Music Needs Right NowEntertainment“Stranger Things 2” and “Ready Player One” Trailers Are Peak ’80s NostalgiaCo.DesignProductA Rare Look At One Of MoMA’s First Design ShowsCitiesMeet The NYC Renter Who Built A Business Exposing Bad LandlordsProductCan Lego Make Coding As Fun As Bricks?

​College Chatbot Service AdmitHub Raises $2.95M in Seed Funding to Guide Students Through School | EdSurge News 
Edtech Business ​College Chatbot Service AdmitHub Raises $2.95M in Seed Funding to Guide Students Through SchoolBy Sydney Johnson     Jan 11, 2017 Irina Strelnikova/ ShutterstockTweetShareEmailDiscover morehigher ed stories and resourcesVisit UsTop StoriesWhat if MOOCs Revolutionize Education After All?Jeffrey R.

Young · Jul 20, 2017 ‘Precision Education’ Hopes to Apply Big Data to Lift Diverse Student GroupsJeffrey R. Young · Jul 19, 2017 A lot of questions came up when I applied for and went through college. Questions like:When is the FAFSA due?But what if you could send a text to get immediate answers to these questions? Answers like:The 17/18 FAFSA is due by June 30, 2018, but I'd recommend submitting it as soon as you can to ensure that you don't miss out on available aid or state and college deadlines.AdmitHub, an edtech startup that’s creating conversational artificial intelligence (AI) to guide students to and through college, is trying to make that happen. (In fact, the conversation above was one that we had with the company’s chatbot, Oli.) Today, the Boston-based company announced it has raised $2.2 million in seed funding to develop Oli and other campus-specific chatbots, grow its team, and expand the service to more U.S. and international institutions. Co-led by Relay Ventures and Reach Capital, with participation from University Ventures and others, the funding round follows a previous $800,000 that the company pulled after participating in 2015 Techstars accelerator program. Combined, AdmitHub has raised a total $2.95 million in seed funding.“We’ve done a heck of a lot of work to create an excellent experience with the bot, but we have only just scratched the surface,” said Andrew Magliozzi, CEO and co-founder of AdmitHub. “We are really excited that we can leverage the collective intelligence of experts across the country to train our bots to deliver free guidance to students.”Oli, the company’s main chatbot, operates 24/7 via text and Facebook messenger to answer general inquiries ranging from financial aid to admission exams like the SAT. Plus, it even shows a bit of personality along the way (“the Styx classic ‘Mr. Roboto’ is pretty cool,” he’ll tell you).AdmitHub also partners with campuses directly to create institution-specific chatbots that help students with questions directly tailored to a particular college. Instead of Oli, the bot is personified by the campus’ mascot—like at Georgia State, where students interact with a bot named after the school’s spirited blue panther, Pounce. But like their human counterparts, these bots aren’t perfect. For example, when we asked Oli about which colleges have environmental science programs, it responded:So many colleges offer study abroad experiences that it is too hard to count! Even if your college does not offer study abroad opportunities, you still may be able to study abroad through programs outside of your own institution.Useful information, but not exactly what we’re looking for. While Oli has a bit of a learning curve ahead, Magliozzi explains that the chatbots are not meant to answer every question that a student might dish. For questions that require a human touch, the bots will notify experts who can best answer them. “If a student says ‘I'm the first person in my family to go to college, can you please help?’” Magliozzi explains, “we tell them about FAFSA and also notify a counselor. That’s not the type of thing you send a text message to respond to.”For institutions using AdmitHub, the chatbot serves three main purposes: to scale up support for students by automating responses to frequently asked questions; to provide admissions officers more data and insight to student progress; and to get personalized help to the students who need most it by reducing the amount of repetitive conversations admissions staff receive. “We make it a point to meet students where they are at via text message,” says Magliozzi. “And the last thing employees at schools want is another dashboard, so we meet them where they are too, which is usually by email.” In addition to Georgia State, AdmitHub currently has partnerships with higher-ed institutions including West Texas A&M University, Bowling Green State University, Allegheny College and The Cooper Union. Pricing varies according to the needs of the college; however AdmitHub says it generally charges institutions between $10 to $25 per student.According to a prepared statement by Scott Burke, assistant vice president for undergraduate admissions at Georgia State, the bots have already proven themselves useful: “To handle more than 185,000 messages with 3,600 students without AdmitHub would have required us to hire at least ten full-time staff members.” The company plans to reveal more data on how Pounce is helping Georgia State students and admissions officials in March at SXSWedu. CommentsEdtech Business ​College Chatbot Service AdmitHub Raises $2.95M in Seed Funding to Guide Students Through SchoolBy Sydney Johnson     Jan 11, 2017 Irina Strelnikova/ ShutterstockTweetShareEmailA lot of questions came up when I applied for and went through college.

AdmitHub, an edtech startup which builds conversational artificial intelligence (AI) to guide students on the path to and through college, has raised $2.95 million in seed funding. The funding round was co-led by Relay Ventures and Reach Capital, with participation from University Ventures and others. The new funding will be used by AdmitHub to grow its team of AI engineers and build out its sales team, with the goal of expanding its technology platform and scaling its reach to more colleges in the US and abroad.AdmitHub's conversational AI platform is the first of its kind to be used by colleges to support students with 24/7 engagement and expert advising. AdmitHub's virtual assistants reach students via the medium this millennial generation uses most: chat. Students receive important reminders, supportive guidance, and answers to thousands of questions via text message or Facebook Messenger. Because AdmitHub's virtual assistants are capable of handling the vast majority of messages, counselors are liberated to support students that most require their attention.'The medium for this generation is messaging,' noted Andrew Magliozzi, CEO and co-founder of AdmitHub. 'A nudge can incite action, but a conversation can transform a student's mindset. With our latest updates, AdmitHub's conversational AI can now provide all students with access to expert college advising via text message or Facebook Messenger.'AdmitHub already has a diverse group of college partners spanning the breadth of higher education, from large public universities like Georgia State University, West Texas A&M University, and Bowling Green State University, to small liberal arts colleges like Allegheny College and The Cooper Union.'To us, AdmitHub is not just a platform, it's a solution,' says Scott Burke, Assistant Vice President for Undergraduate Admissions at Georgia State. 'They are a true partner who've radically exceeded our expectations. To handle more than 185,000 messages with 3,600 students without AdmitHub would have required us to hire at least ten full-time staff members. It is also extremely rare to see such significant impact in the first year of implementing any product.'College partners using AdmitHub generally realize three primary benefits: 1) students receive on-demand access to college counseling; 2) admissions officers enjoy greater insight into student progress; and, 3) counselors have more time to focus on students most in-need of personal attention.'AdmitHub has already successfully applied conversational AI at multiple colleges to engage students in their native mobile environment,' said Kevin Talbot, Managing Partner at Relay Ventures. 'AdmitHub's AI platform drives immediate and sustainable value for their customers.'About AdmitHubFounded in 2014, AdmitHub is an edtech company committed to fostering college success with conversational artificial intelligence. AdmitHub's chatbots provide on-demand assistance via chat by gathering data, sending reminders, answering questions, surveying students, and connecting students to appropriate advisors. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), AdmitHub can calibrate a chatbot for any campus community. Currently, AdmitHub has various university partnerships focusing on recruiting prospects, yielding admits, and retaining enrolled students. AdmitHub's co-founders, Andrew Magliozzi and Kirk Daulerio, have a combined thirty-three years' experience in higher education and software development.
