Considerations When Choosing A Lawyer

Response and Communication

Did the attorney or law firm respond promptly?
Did you get to speak to an attorney directly or with a receptionist?

Trustworthiness and Compatibility

Is the lawyer telling you what you want to hear or being straight forward and honest?
Do you trust his/her advice?
Are you compatible?

Professional Experience, Academics, and Community Service

Has the lawyer handled your specific issue before? If so, what were the results?
What association and affiliations does the attorney have?
Which law school did the attorney attend?
Is the lawyer involved in his or her community?
