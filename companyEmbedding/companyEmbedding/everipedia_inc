Company Summary





Everipedia is basically a thug Wikipedia. We removed some of the more annoying aspects of Wikipedia and created a site that is much easier to use. Notability requirements are removed and citations / editing are much easier (what you see is what you get WYSIWYG, vs Wiki markup). There is also a commenting page for each link or file added.

How to Disrupt any Industry in 3 Steps


Building startups doesn't have to be rocket science

Disruption is what every entrepreneur hopes for when they start a business. This hope doesn't only stem to create a viable business, but to make severe impact on their customers, and the world around them.
Take a business that disrupted the taxi industry; Uber. They took the concerns with the traditional taxi model, empowered people that had cars to become chauffeurs for others, and eliminated the entire need of taxis altogether.
A site that is the definition of disruption is Everipedia. I spoke to cofounder Mahbod Moghadam, formerly Cofounder of Rap Genius (aka "Genius") about how Everipedia is disrupting Wikipedia, and the process he uses to disrupt any industry.
1. Find a pain in a system
Like most industries, there is usually one glaring issue, and concern that customers, or people that work specifically with a business or organization experience.
For example, with Wikipedia, around a thousand articles get deleted every week. And yet, even with its relatively small number of pages, Alexa deems Wikipedia the 7th-largest site in the world. So instead, with Everipedia, you can make an article about anything or anyone, and the format is simple enough that you can add information from your phone.
Similarly, Wikipedia has no social element to their pages, versus Everipedia has implemented social features that allow, for example, celebrities to share and interact with fans.
Thirdly, contributing to Wikipedia doesn't attach any goal or purpose, versus Everipedia takes the IQ points for contributing to Everipedia, and the plan is for IQ to someday be interchangeable for equity in the site. Contributors who put up a lot of college-related pages can be appointed "Campus Representatives".
Lastly, Everipedia's philosophical difference from Wikipedia of taking citations from anywhere bring a unique feel to the Everipedia. For Moghadam, these are the immediate problems, and need for a viable solution.
2. Get feedback on the pain
When Moghadam started using Wikipedia, he learned very quickly that the people that use Wikipedia are very peculiar: most of the dedicated editors are white, single males. Similarly, he began to reach out to other peers that tried using Wikipedia to learn more about what success and failures they had with the product.
To get heavily involved in Wikipedia, you need to know "wiki markup" which is kind of like a coding language. This results in a lot of consistent, often bigoted biases in the content Wikipedia deems notable. There aren't many dedicated contributors to Wikipedia, so a small group is in control. It's hard for "outsiders" to get involved, especially because the site is difficult to use.
Another great tip when you are getting iterative feedback on the pain and product is to keep it simple for your consumers. One of my all time favorite examples of keeping it simple is WhatsApp, which was acquired by Facebook for $19 billion dollars. A simple concept, with the KISS (keep it simple stupid) concept clear.
For Everipedia, the biggest difference between Everipedia and Wikipedia, is similarity to popular products, such as Facebook.
 Wikipedia was built in 1999 and it hasn't changed much. Everipedia is new, it feels the same way Facebook feels. This adds an element of stickiness for consumers, which allows them to adopt to products quicker.
3. Implement the solution and iterate
Once you have discovered a major pain that people have, and received feedback on the pain and the potential solutions, the importance is to push a simple product that people can give you feedback on, and continue the iterative process.
For Moghadam, he quickly launched the site after receiving iterative feedback from his prospective users, and to this date, is receiving astronomical growth.
How will you disrupt an industry?

Profiles

























Cylance Inc. is an American software firm founded in 2012. It develops antivirus programs and other kinds of computer software that prevent, rather than reactively detect, viruses and malware. The company is based in Irvine, California. Cylance has been described as “the first company to apply artificial intelligence, algorithmic science and machine learning to cyber security.” [6] Cylance executives have stated their mission is to block computer viruses or malware before they have an effect on a user's computer.  FoundingCylance was founded by Stuart McClure and Ryan Permeh. McClure was previously co-founder of Foundstone, a security consultancy, which he sold to McAfee in 2004, becoming that firm's Chief Tech Officer. McClure is also the author of Hacking Exposed, reportedly the best-selling IT security book to date.Cylance's founding came about as a result of McClure's speeches he had previously given on cybersecurity, where he was often asked how he protected his own computer. He noted that he lacked trust in any security technology since it was all reactive in nature, meaning it only cleaned up after an attack. Consequently, McClure began developing a technology based on "proactive protection".PeopleMcClure is co-founder, CEO, and President of Cylance. Permeh is co-founder and Chief Scientist. Jeff Ishmael is CFO. Shane Shook is Chief Knowledge Officer and Global Vice President of Consulting. Malcolm Harkins is Global Chief Information Security Officer.In March 2016, Cylance named Silicon Valley lawyer Brady Berg as its General Counsel and human-resources executive Vina Leite as its Chief People Officer.FundingA July 2015 report indicated that Cylance had raised $42 million from such investors as DFJ Growth, KKR, Dell Ventures, CapitalOne Ventures, and TenEleven Ventures.ProductsCylancePROTECT is “an antivirus and application control solution for fixed-function devices that leverages artificial intelligence to detect and prevent malware from executing on endpoints in real time.” CylanceV is “a solution for local integration into network appliances, endpoint software, and services platforms.”The firm also provides “incident response, compromise assessments, forensic investigations, industrial control systems, critical infrastructure and key resource security, penetration testing, and custom services.”Product featuresMcClure stated that Cylance's antivirus product does not use typical security features, such as unique signatures, heuristics, behavioral analysis, sandboxing, virtualization, or blacklisting. Rather, the product uses artificial intelligence to identify and stop attackers. McClure stated that Cylance security features are similar to the human brain's identifying of threats, wherein it "teaches" computers to identify indicators of an attack.Operation CleaverOperation Cleaver was a covert cyberwarfare operation carried out by the Iranian government against targets around the world, specifically critical infrastructure entities. Cylance uncovered the operation and described it in a report released in late 2014. Iranian officials rejected Cylance's conclusions, but the FBI tacitly confirmed them.MOTEX collaborationIn May 2016, Cylance announced a new collaboration with MOTEX, an Osaka-based firm, to integrate MOTEX LanScope, an endpoint security management, and CylancePROTECT, Cylance’s leading product, which actively detects and prevents malware. The end product will be called CylancePROTECT Cat. This collaboration brings Cylance's activities into the Japanese market.Honors and awardsIn July 2016, McClure was named Orange County Entrepreneur of the Year in the category of technology.
