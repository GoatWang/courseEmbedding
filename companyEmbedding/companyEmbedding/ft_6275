It looked great when we first received it. However after a couple vacuums the edges are coming undone. I expected it to be better quality with Home Depot putting there name by it.

        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!

Return policy details




RETURN POLICY: We are committed to customer satisfaction and therefore accept returns for any reason within 14 days of delivery as long as the following conditions are met: The item must be in original, unused condition and must be returned in the original packaging. We are unable to accept any item that has been installed and/or damaged. We cannot accept return items that are not in the original packaging. These are constraints set by product manufacturers and we have to honor their policies on returns. 
Items returned in poor condition or having parts missing will not be credited. Return shipping charges must be paid by the customer. Unless our company or the listing is in error. The customer is responsible for paying return shipping costs. In the event of a fitment issue we will require a VIN # for vehicle confirmation to process your return.  

RETURNS: The cost of the original shipping will be charged to the customer on returned items without an exchange. 

EXCHANGES: The customer will be responsible for the original shipping and the return shipping costs of the original item. The shipping on your replacement item will be free of charge as a convenience to you. 

The customer is responsible for providing shipping insurance that covers the full price of any item being returned. If the customer is shipping back on their own they are responsible for any damages that occur during return shipping and filing any claims with the shipper. 

The customer must obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) from us. The customer must contact us and obtain an RMA prior to returning any products. Be sure the RMA# is clearly referenced on the return label. 

WARRANTY RETURNS: 
When the product is received and it is determined that there is a fitment problem due to manufacturing defect, we simply request that you submit proof in the form of digital pictures. If the product proves to be defective, it will be picked up and exchanged for a new non-defective item at no cost to you. 

DAMAGE CLAIMS: 
Please inspect your package thoroughly upon receiving it, any damage claims must be filed by contacting us through eBay within 72 hours of receipt.

                    This is a great place to grow up or raise your family- I should know- I grew up here!  We love the small town feel but then close enough to Fort Wayne or South Bend if major shopping is needed!  Leesburg is home to some very popular things- like my favorite- Lakes!! Lake Tippecanoe is one of the lakes that is home in Leesburg, this lake is the deepest natural lake in Indiana and was recently featured on a Lakefront Bargain Hunt Show of HGTV!  This lake is filled with fun- from all sports including skiing, wakeboarding, surfing, to jet skiing- paddle boarding, kayaking- to just floating or fishing- Lake Tippecanoe is a summer destination to not be forgotten! If you golf we are home to the Lake Tippecanoe Country Club where golfing and club life is quite popular!  We have Patona Bay Boat Service proving new boat sales and service on the lake as well as the famous Tippy Ballroom Gardens- if you are looking for a place to call home- Lake Tippecanoe is calling you! It called us and we have not left!  Leesburg is also a great town with all kinds of places to eat and drink- and visit- Tippy Winery just opened and is a favorite landing spot of the locals and tourists alike- with live music and wonderful atmosphere to enjoy family and friends!  Come see what we all love so much and visit Leesburg and Lake Tippecanoe!

Sellers on eBay have a huge inventory of car and truck exterior parts, so it's quick and easy to find the perfect components for keeping your vehicle running.
Original Equipment Manufacturer Components
What do you need? A new grille and bumper to fix up that fender bender you were in last week, a replacement side mirror for the one that lost an argument with oncoming traffic, or a new door panel to replace the one that's rusting off its hinges? Whatever you're shopping for, sellers on eBay have the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) truck and car body parts to restore your vehicle to its original factory finish. OEM components often come at a premium, but they exactly match the components the manufacturer installed, so you know they are going to fit well, you know they are going to match the vehicle's appearance, and you know they are going to be of the same high quality.
Aftermarket Body Parts
If it's time to make a change, and you want to give your car or truck a new look, shop for aftermarket body parts. Many third-party companies produce aftermarket parts for a wide range of makes and models. The large choice means you get more chances to customize the look of your vehicle, and you usually pay less than when you shop for OEM parts. However, you need to shop with care, to ensure you get products that are compatible with your vehicle. Parts that fit incorrectly may involve customization at a body shop, or they might compromise the vehicle's appearance and safety. If in doubt, contact the seller, who may be able to provide more information to help you make the right purchase.
Incredible Choice
The huge inventory of vehicle parts on eBay includes everything from body panels to electrical components. Find hoods, sunroofs, fenders, mirrors, trim, spoilers, tailgates, truck bed accessories, locks, racks, snowplows, and much more. Items are available in new, used, and refurbished condition, and some sellers offer rare parts that are hard to find anywhere else.
A One-Stop Shopping Solution
Shopping on eBay makes finding the right auto body parts simple. With powerful search functions, and a massive inventory of competitively priced products, you are sure to find what you need, when you need it, leaving you with more time to focus on the important things, like getting the kids to school on time, or tackling every dirt track and mountain the great outdoors can throw at you.Side Refine PanelShop by CategoryCar & Truck PartsCar & Truck Exterior PartsCar & Truck Air DamsCar & Truck AntennasCar & Truck Body KitsCar & Truck BrasCar & Truck BumpersCar CoversCar & Truck Door Hinge Conversion KitsCar & Truck Exterior Door Panels & FramesCar & Truck Exterior Door HandlesCar & Truck FendersCar & Truck GrillesCar & Truck HoodsCar & Truck Locks & HardwareCar & Truck Exterior MirrorsCar & Truck Exterior Mouldings & TrimNerf Bars & Running BoardsCar & Truck RacksCar & Truck Bug ShieldsCar & Truck Snow Plows & PartsCar & Truck Splash Guards & Mud FlapsCar & Truck Spoilers & WingsCar & Truck Sunroofs, Hard Tops & Soft TopsCar & Truck Tailgates & LiftgatesCar & Truck Towing & HaulingTruck Bed AccessoriesCar & Truck Trunk Lids & PartsCar & Truck Windshield Wiper BladesCar & Truck Windshield Wiper SystemsOther Car & Truck Exterior PartsMoreLessWarrantysee allNo WarrantyUnspecified Length90 Day6 Month1 Year3 YearLifetimeBrandsee allBMWChevroletFordHondaMoparNissanToyotaUnbrandedBrand Typesee allAftermarket BrandedGenuine OEMPrivate LabelUnbrandedNot SpecifiedPlacement on Vehiclesee allFrontLeftRearRightConditionsee allNewNew other (see details)RemanufacturedUsedFor parts or not workingNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
