BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Amedisys employs more than 16,000 individuals at more than 500 locations in 45 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. In 2010, annual revenues were approximately $1.6 billion.[2] Amedisys was ranked 999 on the Fortune 1000 in 2011.

History and governance[edit]
Amedisys was founded in 1982 by William F. Borne, a registered nurse from Reserve, Louisiana, who has served as chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman of the board since that time.[3] In 1993, the company completed a reverse acquisition with M&N Capital Corp, and began trading on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market in 1994. Additional public offerings of its common stock were completed in 2004 and 2006.
As of Nov. 6, 2011, the members of the board of directors of Amedisys are: William F. Borne, chairman; Don Washburn, lead director; Ronald LaBorde; Jake L. Netterville, CPA; David Pitts, and Peter Ricchiuti.[4] Borne resigned as CEO, chairman, and director of Amedisys on February 24, 2014, 33 years after founding the company, and was named Chairman Emeritus by the company's Board of Directors.[5][6] Ronald (Ronnie) A. LaBorde was named Interim CEO, having been Amedisys president and chief financial office for two years, and a member of the Board of Directors for 17 years.[5][6]
In June 2011, Amedisys closed the acquisition of Beacon Hospice, a New England provider of hospice services with 24 locations in five states.[7]
In March 2008, Amedisys closed the acquisition of TLC Health Care Services, a home health provider with more than 100 locations.[8]
Amedisys announced March 28, 2014, it was closing 29 care centers (23 home health and six hospice) and consolidating another 25 (21 home health and four hospice).[9] The Concord (NH) office of Beacon Hospice was closed on April 30, 2014.[10] Hyder Family Hospice House (Dover, NH), one of the facilities in the Beacon Hospice acquisition, was also to be closed.[11] Hyder House was the only in-patient hospice facility in Strafford County, NH. (Hyder House was expected to transfer to county ownership on August 1, 2014.[12])
Amedisys announced a $150-million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice on April 23, 2014. This settlement was about Medicare reimbursements for home health services by some Amedisys care centers from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2010, as well as a Stark Law infraction involving care services provided to a physician group in exchange for compensation inconsistent with fair market value from April 1, 2008, through April 30, 2012, an issue Amedisys had voluntarily disclosed.[13] The $150 million included more than $26 million to settle six whistleblower lawsuits in Pennsylvania and one in Georgia.[14] The $150 million is five times what a leading analyst in the industry estimates Amedisys will earn in 2014 before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization.[14]
Recognitions[edit]
Amedisys is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC).
In June 2011, three Amedisys care centers were awarded the first Integrated Health Care Standards Accreditation for Behavioral Health Disorders by ACHC.[15]
In 2010 and 2011, under the Medicare Home Health Pay for Performance (HHP4P) demonstration Amedisys received the largest reward in both years ($3.6 million in 2010, $4.7 million in 2011).[16] HHP4P shared more than $15 million in savings with 166 home health agencies that either maintained high levels of quality or made significant improvements in quality of care.[17]
In July 2011, Amedisys was named Innovator of the Year during the 2011 Louisiana Governor’s Technology Awards for its patient care management web application for physicians, Mercury Doc.[18]
In October 2011, over 250 Amedisys agencies were named to the 2011 HomeCare Elite™, a compilation of the top-performing home health agencies based on quality outcomes, quality improvement and financial performance.[19] One-hundred-four Amedisys care centers have been honored multiple times, including 13 that have been acknowledged every year since the inception of the HomeCare Elite in 2005.[20]
In 2010, Amedisys launched the first nationwide home health care transitions program, aiming to reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions through patient education and care coordination. The program and a Georgia case study demonstrating a downward trend in acute care hospitalization rate were highlighted in Home Health Quality Improvement Campaign’s Cross Settings I – Best Practice Intervention Package.[21]
Foundation and charitable giving[edit]
In 2005, Amedisys established a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the Christen Foundation,[22] to distribute contributions to local nonprofit organizations and employees in need. The Christen Foundation also administers donations to Amedisys’ Hospice Fund.
Amedisys employees’ contributions rank second in the nation in fundraising for the American Heart Association, next to only the American Heart Association itself.[23]

History and governance[edit]
Amedisys was founded in 1982 by William F. Borne, a registered nurse from Reserve, Louisiana, who has served as chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman of the board since that time.[3] In 1993, the company completed a reverse acquisition with M&N Capital Corp, and began trading on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market in 1994. Additional public offerings of its common stock were completed in 2004 and 2006.
As of Nov. 6, 2011, the members of the board of directors of Amedisys are: William F. Borne, chairman; Don Washburn, lead director; Ronald LaBorde; Jake L. Netterville, CPA; David Pitts, and Peter Ricchiuti.[4] Borne resigned as CEO, chairman, and director of Amedisys on February 24, 2014, 33 years after founding the company, and was named Chairman Emeritus by the company's Board of Directors.[5][6] Ronald (Ronnie) A. LaBorde was named Interim CEO, having been Amedisys president and chief financial office for two years, and a member of the Board of Directors for 17 years.[5][6]
In June 2011, Amedisys closed the acquisition of Beacon Hospice, a New England provider of hospice services with 24 locations in five states.[7]
In March 2008, Amedisys closed the acquisition of TLC Health Care Services, a home health provider with more than 100 locations.[8]
Amedisys announced March 28, 2014, it was closing 29 care centers (23 home health and six hospice) and consolidating another 25 (21 home health and four hospice).[9] The Concord (NH) office of Beacon Hospice was closed on April 30, 2014.[10] Hyder Family Hospice House (Dover, NH), one of the facilities in the Beacon Hospice acquisition, was also to be closed.[11] Hyder House was the only in-patient hospice facility in Strafford County, NH. (Hyder House was expected to transfer to county ownership on August 1, 2014.[12])
Amedisys announced a $150-million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice on April 23, 2014. This settlement was about Medicare reimbursements for home health services by some Amedisys care centers from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2010, as well as a Stark Law infraction involving care services provided to a physician group in exchange for compensation inconsistent with fair market value from April 1, 2008, through April 30, 2012, an issue Amedisys had voluntarily disclosed.[13] The $150 million included more than $26 million to settle six whistleblower lawsuits in Pennsylvania and one in Georgia.[14] The $150 million is five times what a leading analyst in the industry estimates Amedisys will earn in 2014 before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization.[14]
Recognitions[edit]
Amedisys is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC).
In June 2011, three Amedisys care centers were awarded the first Integrated Health Care Standards Accreditation for Behavioral Health Disorders by ACHC.[15]
In 2010 and 2011, under the Medicare Home Health Pay for Performance (HHP4P) demonstration Amedisys received the largest reward in both years ($3.6 million in 2010, $4.7 million in 2011).[16] HHP4P shared more than $15 million in savings with 166 home health agencies that either maintained high levels of quality or made significant improvements in quality of care.[17]
In July 2011, Amedisys was named Innovator of the Year during the 2011 Louisiana Governor’s Technology Awards for its patient care management web application for physicians, Mercury Doc.[18]
In October 2011, over 250 Amedisys agencies were named to the 2011 HomeCare Elite™, a compilation of the top-performing home health agencies based on quality outcomes, quality improvement and financial performance.[19] One-hundred-four Amedisys care centers have been honored multiple times, including 13 that have been acknowledged every year since the inception of the HomeCare Elite in 2005.[20]
In 2010, Amedisys launched the first nationwide home health care transitions program, aiming to reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions through patient education and care coordination. The program and a Georgia case study demonstrating a downward trend in acute care hospitalization rate were highlighted in Home Health Quality Improvement Campaign’s Cross Settings I – Best Practice Intervention Package.[21]
Foundation and charitable giving[edit]
In 2005, Amedisys established a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the Christen Foundation,[22] to distribute contributions to local nonprofit organizations and employees in need. The Christen Foundation also administers donations to Amedisys’ Hospice Fund.
Amedisys employees’ contributions rank second in the nation in fundraising for the American Heart Association, next to only the American Heart Association itself.[23]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
