Franco-Nevada Corporation is a Toronto, Ontario, Canada-based company that owns royalties and streams in gold mining and other commodity and natural resource investments. It is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.
The 'Old Franco-Nevada' was a publicly listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange from 1983 to 2002. In 1986, Old Franco-Nevada made its first royalty acquisition, and acquired or created additional royalties and resource investments from 1986 to 2002. Following several royalty acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s, Old Franco-Nevada sold its only mining property to Normandy Mining in exchange for 19.9% of the company's shares.
In 2002, Newmont acquired 100% of Franco-Nevada as part of a three-way combination of Newmont, Normandy and Old Franco-Nevada. Newmont maintained Franco-Nevada as a royalty holding division, transferring numerous other royalties to it over the five-year period following the acquisition, building its portfolio of royalties to include investments in almost 300 royalies (two-thirds in bases and precious metal miners, and one-third in oil and natural gas). In 2007 Newmont spun off Franco-Nevada in an Initial Public Offering.

Early history[edit]
Franco-Nevada initially began trading as a public gold exploration company in 1983 and was led by executives Seymour Schulich and Pierre Lassonde. At the time, oil and gas royalty ownership—but not gold royalty ownership—was an established business strategy. In 1985 Franco-Nevada raised $930,000 to purchase gold royalties in a follow-on offering. The company made its first royalty investment in 1986, spending half the corporate treasury ($2 million) to acquire 4% of revenues from a mine in Nevada owned by Western States Minerals. The mine had an annual production of 44,000 ounces (1,200,000 g) of gold. Franco-Nevada assumed that known reserves would allow the royalty to pay for itself regardless of additional exploration results. By 2002 the property generated $23 million annually for Franco-Nevada.
In 1988 Franco-Nevada purchased a royalty on the Castle Mountain mine in California. Despite the Castle Mountain mine being unsuccessful, losing money and eventually closing, Franco-Nevada collected triple its investment of $2.8 million.
Franco-Nevada further went on to purchase royalties in various other commodities, but continued its focus on gold.[1]
Newmont take over[edit]
In April 2001, Franco-Nevada sold the Nevada Midas mine, its only wholly owned mine, to Normandy Mining in exchange for 20% of Normandy and a five-percent royalty on the mine. That September, Anglo Gold made a bid for Normandy at a valuation 60% greater than Franco-Nevada's acquisition cost. Seeing the potential to take advantage of Newmont's rivalry with Anglo, Schulich and Lassonde approached Newmont Mining Corporation to discuss purchasing Franco-Nevada and Normandy, striking a deal richer than Anglo's offer, and ultimately valuing Franco-Nevada shares at a 22% premium.[2][3]
Split from Newmont[edit]
In 2007 Franco-Nevada launched an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange, raising CA$1.1 billion[4] which helped fund the US$1.2 billion acquisition of a large portfolio of royalties from Newmont.[5] The listing was one of the largest in Canadian history, second only to the 2000 Sun Life IPO, and the largest mining IPO in North American History.[4][6][7]

Franco-Nevada Corporation is a Toronto, Ontario, Canada-based company that owns royalties and streams in gold mining and other commodity and natural resource investments. It is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.
The 'Old Franco-Nevada' was a publicly listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange from 1983 to 2002. In 1986, Old Franco-Nevada made its first royalty acquisition, and acquired or created additional royalties and resource investments from 1986 to 2002. Following several royalty acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s, Old Franco-Nevada sold its only mining property to Normandy Mining in exchange for 19.9% of the company's shares.
In 2002, Newmont acquired 100% of Franco-Nevada as part of a three-way combination of Newmont, Normandy and Old Franco-Nevada. Newmont maintained Franco-Nevada as a royalty holding division, transferring numerous other royalties to it over the five-year period following the acquisition, building its portfolio of royalties to include investments in almost 300 royalies (two-thirds in bases and precious metal miners, and one-third in oil and natural gas). In 2007 Newmont spun off Franco-Nevada in an Initial Public Offering.

Early history[edit]
Franco-Nevada initially began trading as a public gold exploration company in 1983 and was led by executives Seymour Schulich and Pierre Lassonde. At the time, oil and gas royalty ownership—but not gold royalty ownership—was an established business strategy. In 1985 Franco-Nevada raised $930,000 to purchase gold royalties in a follow-on offering. The company made its first royalty investment in 1986, spending half the corporate treasury ($2 million) to acquire 4% of revenues from a mine in Nevada owned by Western States Minerals. The mine had an annual production of 44,000 ounces (1,200,000 g) of gold. Franco-Nevada assumed that known reserves would allow the royalty to pay for itself regardless of additional exploration results. By 2002 the property generated $23 million annually for Franco-Nevada.
In 1988 Franco-Nevada purchased a royalty on the Castle Mountain mine in California. Despite the Castle Mountain mine being unsuccessful, losing money and eventually closing, Franco-Nevada collected triple its investment of $2.8 million.
Franco-Nevada further went on to purchase royalties in various other commodities, but continued its focus on gold.[1]
Newmont take over[edit]
In April 2001, Franco-Nevada sold the Nevada Midas mine, its only wholly owned mine, to Normandy Mining in exchange for 20% of Normandy and a five-percent royalty on the mine. That September, Anglo Gold made a bid for Normandy at a valuation 60% greater than Franco-Nevada's acquisition cost. Seeing the potential to take advantage of Newmont's rivalry with Anglo, Schulich and Lassonde approached Newmont Mining Corporation to discuss purchasing Franco-Nevada and Normandy, striking a deal richer than Anglo's offer, and ultimately valuing Franco-Nevada shares at a 22% premium.[2][3]
Split from Newmont[edit]
In 2007 Franco-Nevada launched an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange, raising CA$1.1 billion[4] which helped fund the US$1.2 billion acquisition of a large portfolio of royalties from Newmont.[5] The listing was one of the largest in Canadian history, second only to the 2000 Sun Life IPO, and the largest mining IPO in North American History.[4][6][7]

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
Franco-Nevada Corp's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=69.1/172.7*91


=36.51



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, Franco-Nevada Corp's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
Franco-Nevada Corp's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=283-72.9+0.75 * 69.1+0.5 * 12.7


=268.3



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

Franco-Nevada
Home»About Us
	






Overview
Franco-Nevada Corporation is the leading gold royalty and streaming company with the largest and most diversified portfolio of assets. The Company is precious metals-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project. Franco-Nevada strives to generate 80% of revenue from precious metals over a long-term horizon which includes gold, silver and PGM. 

The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada’s business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are:

Exposure to precious metals price optionality;
A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment;
Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies;
A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls;
A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle;
A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead; and
A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues.

Franco-Nevada’s financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada’s advanced and exploration assets into production.
Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry. Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns.
Franco-Nevada’s shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV. An investment in Franco-Nevada’s shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than a gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada’s share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks.
