LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) announced today that Christopher Todoroff, vice        president and senior corporate counsel for Aetna Inc., has been        appointed senior vice president and general counsel for the firm,        effective August 4. Senior Vice President Arthur P. Hipwell, who joined        Humana in 1979 and served as general counsel for nearly 15 years, is        retiring.       “Christopher Todoroff brings wide-ranging        experience, proven effectiveness and profound industry insight to his        new role,” said Michael B. McCallister, Humana’s        president and chief executive officer. “At        Aetna, where he leads the law department’s        corporate section, he works closely with the board of directors and has        been a strong contributor to that company’s        success over many years.”         McCallister praised Hipwell as “a long-time        major contributor to Humana’s growth and        success. Art’s deep understanding of our        business and his ability to define, articulate and drive Humana’s        growth opportunities over nearly three decades will be sorely missed.”         Todoroff joined Aetna in 1995, and has assumed increasing responsibility        since then. He is accountable for all of Aetna’s        corporate governance activities and has played a leading role as senior        counsel for a range of critical areas including mergers and        acquisitions, corporate finance, risk management, and investments, among        others.             A New Jersey native, Todoroff is a 1984 graduate of Rutgers University,        where he earned a bachelor’s degree in        business administration. He graduated cum laude from Cornell University        Law School in 1987 and was editor of the Cornell Law Review. Before        joining Aetna, he practiced law in New York and Florida.       About Humana         Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is one of the nation’s        largest publicly traded health, and supplemental benefits companies,        with approximately 11.4 million medical members.
