The goal of my research program at the Sloan Kettering Institute over the past three decades plus has been the understanding of the natural history of genomic instability in cancer cells and its implication to clinical behavior of tumors on the one hand, and to normal cellular developmental pathways on the other. Over this time period, the tools to identify, measure, and analyze the mechanisms of genomic instability have evolved remarkably.

RajuChagantiPh.D.Member & Professor, Cell Biology Program Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center chagantr@mskcc.orgPluripotent embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells derived from adult male germ cell tumors (GCTs) represent a unique resource to molecularly define lineage differentiation pathways and identify novel genes. EC cell lines share pluripotentiality with embryonic stem (ES) cells. Furthermore, both ES cells in culture and many GCTs show characteristic gains 12p and/or 17q which aid in maintenance of pluripotency. Being of unlimited proliferation potential, EC cells are an excellent alternative resource to study regulation of self-renewal and pluripotency. Professor Chaganti's program is directed at understanding the role of stem cells in malignancy and regulation of self-renewal and pluripotency.

The goal of my research program at the Sloan Kettering Institute over the past three decades plus has been the understanding of the natural history of genomic instability in cancer cells and its implication to clinical behavior of tumors on the one hand, and to normal cellular developmental pathways on the other. Over this time period, the tools to identify, measure, and analyze the mechanisms of genomic instability have evolved remarkably.
