The youngest Schnuck brother of six siblings — a man with a deep background in finance who has held the No. 2 spot at Schnuck Markets — is getting ready to sit in the driver’s seat.Todd Schnuck, 55, will succeed brother Scott in March as chief executive officer of the family-owned-and-operated grocery chain with 100 stores in five states, the Maryland Heights-based company announced Thursday. He is a grandson of the grocery chain’s founders.In a recent interview, Todd Schnuck did not lay out any grand plans to reinvent the company or chart out a radical departure for the chain, which is marking its 75th anniversary this year. Rather, he said he would continue in the direction of his brother to develop the chain’s food expertise and cater local stores to the needs of neighborhoods. And he said he would focus on providing more information to the chain’s 15,000 employees so they can better serve customers.
“We’ve been very much joined at the hip in terms of our partnership and moving forward with the focus on food,” he said of his years working with his brother. “I like to say we’re brothers, but we’re not clones. I might have a bit more analytical bent than Scott might have. So the way I look at things will be different.”When he takes the reins, he will continue to have to grapple with the fallout from the massive data breach earlier that year in which as many as 2.4 million Schnucks customers had their payment card information compromised in a cyber attack.In the immediate aftermath, some people became wary of shopping at Schnucks. But many of those customers have now returned, and the Schnucks say they are pleased by the recovery.“While we’re not knocking the doors down, we’re running even to slightly above last year,” Todd Schnuck said of the company’s sales.And he noted that despite the breach, sales were up 4 percent to $2.6 billion in the company’s last fiscal year, which ended in September. That was aided in part by a strong start to the fiscal year before the cyber attack.The Schnucks wouldn’t elaborate much more on the issue because of lawsuits. But they say they have enhanced security and continue to look at ways to improve it. They also just hired a new director of information security — a full-time position for the company — who started earlier this week.The succession plan, Scott Schnuck noted, was put into place well before the breach in October 2012.“I’m 63 — almost 64,” he said. “I’ve been CEO for eight years. I think Todd is ready. … And there’s a lot of things I want to do while I can do it.”Among those plans include chairing the United Way Campaign of Greater St. Louis this year. But he will remain involved with the grocery business as the company’s chairman. Older brother Craig, who previously led the company for 17 years, will officially retire from the company and become chairman emeritus. He will remain a shareholder along with his other siblings and a cousin.A NEW NO. 2As part of the leadership transition, the Schnucks decided to bring in some outside talent to be Todd Schnuck’s No. 2 person. In September, Anthony Hucker, 47, joined the company after holding executive positions with Wal-Mart, Aldi and Giant Food. Currently the company’s chief strategy officer, he will be elevated to the position of chief operating officer in March.Speaking in a voice that reveals his British roots, Hucker said Schnuck Markets can better differentiate its stores for the local demographics than the large national players.The larger chains “are about leverage and scale,” he said. “And leverage and scale is about standardization. So they can’t be locally relevant. … We’ve fought off, and we’ll continue to fight off, the best.”
When Scott Schnuck took over the company in 2006, Wal-Mart was already breathing down the necks of Schnuck Markets with the expansion of its supercenters, featuring a wide grocery assortment. At the same time, they were feeling pressure at the higher end from concepts such as Whole Foods.So Scott Schnuck decided the best way to compete was to build up the chain’s food expertise. That meant getting rid of categories such as hardware, toys and picture frames to make more room for food trends such as gluten-free products.“We wanted to become the best in food,” Scott Schnuck said.So today, Schnucks has 36 certified wine specialists, 19 professional chefs and 43 Schnucks Cooks coaches, who show customers how to make easy meals at kiosks in stores.During his tenure, Scott Schnuck also spearheaded the development of two very different store prototypes in 2009 — the 21,000-square-foot Culinaria in the heart of downtown, which is about the third the size of a traditional store. The chain also built a 74,000-square-foot flagship store that features a cheese room and an in-store restaurant in Des Peres.He also was at the helm when Schnuck Markets exited the Memphis, Tenn., market amid stiff competition from Wal-Mart and other chains. It sold nine of its stores there to Kroger and closed three others. Later that year, it made a bigger investment in Rockford, Ill., when it bought seven stores in that market from Kroger. Today, it has 11 stores in the Rockford region.
As Todd Schnuck prepares to take the helm of the company, the chain continues to face competition from Wal-Mart, Dierbergs, Aldi, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Shop ’n Save and Save-A-Lot. But on top of that, a new crop of grocery concepts enters the market, such as the Fields Foods, which just opened near Lafayette Square; the Fresh Thyme Farmers Markets, planning to open some stores here; and a Lucky’s Market, coming to Rock Hill.But he doesn’t seem fazed.“It just makes us better,” Todd Schnuck said. “That competition gives you a charge and makes you say, ‘OK, what do we do to keep what we built over the last 75 years?’”THE NEXT GENERATION?Todd Schnuck started his career as an investment banker with A.G. Edwards & Sons. He joined the family business in 1987 as the treasurer and was the company’s chief financial officer for many years. His current position is that of president and chief operating officer.In the last couple of years, Schnucks has been focusing on store remodels to boost its core business. For example, the chain recently completed remodels of its stores in south city (on South Grand Boulevard), Chesterfield and Alton. Todd Schnuck said the grocer will revamp an four or five more local stores before the end of its fiscal year in September.The chain is also in the midst of expansion. In the Metro East, it recently bought the Columbia Centre Market Place, to be converted to a Schnucks store. It has purchased land in Farmington for a new store. And it is building a new store near Lindenwood University in St. Charles and one in Evansville, Ind.As consumers have become more aware of the carbon footprint in transporting food long distances, Schnucks has increased its array of local produce and other locally sourced goods. In the future, it plans to buy produce from a yet-to-be-built local greenhouse by BrightFarms. Schnuck said that the plans for the greenhouse have been pushed off by BrightFarms until June.Todd Schnuck will likely be the last member of the third generation of Schnuck grocers to lead the company. It remains to be seen the roles that the next generation may take on. Some of them work for the company in various facets. And a few are just graduating from or about to go to business school.“All have expressed an interest in the business, and our job is to get them back here,” he said.
