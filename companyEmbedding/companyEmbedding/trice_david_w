The Credit Bubble Symposium


About The Company
David W. Tice & Assoc., Inc., was an investment management firm based in Dallas, Texas.  In December, 1995 DWT&A started the Prudent Bear Fund to give individual investors the chance to protect themselves against a declining stock market. This fund was  structured with the flexibility to make short sales and to be "net-short" the US stock market.  The Prudent Global Income Fund, opened in February 2000, was designed to benefit from a weakening U.S. dollar and rising gold prices.  In December 2008, Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII) completed the acquisition of certain assets of David W. Tice & Associates that relate to the management of the Prudent Bear Fund and the Prudent Global Income Fund.  For information on the  Federated Prudent Bear Fund and Federated Prudent Global Income Fund, please visit FederatedInvestors.com.
In the fall of 1999, David W. Tice & Assoc., Inc. sponsored The Credit Bubble Symposium in New York to alert investors and policy makers of the credit excesses in the U.S. financial system. Visit the The Credit Bubble Symposium section of the site to listen to presentations online.
About David W. Tice
David Tice is a CPA and Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). Mr. Tice graduated from Texas Christian University (TCU) in 1976 with a BBA in Accounting. He continued at TCU to receive his MBA degree in Finance in 1977. After graduation, Tice worked for three years with Atlantic Richfield Company in a management training program and as an internal auditor, where he traveled worldwide to evaluate the company's internal controls. He also worked in a group that prepared responses to proposals from the financial accounting standards board. He then spent four years with ENSERCH Corporation, a diversified energy company, where he evaluated all acquisitions and corporate finance options that required approval from the Board of Directors. Just before leaving ENSERCH, he was promoted to Manager of the Corporate Budgeting Department where he was in charge of the consolidated budget for ENSERCH's nine divisions. Tice then joined Concorde Financial Corporation where he spent four years as Director of Investments and was responsible for launching an equity mutual fund.
His work has gained national recognition through several Barron's articles he wrote, and from Mr. Tice's appearances on business television. He has appeared on the Nightly Business Report, Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser, and is a frequent guest on CNBC. Tice has taken the role of a Cassandra to warn investors about the dangers of investing near the end of a secular bull market and has debated nearly every bullish Wall Street strategist.

David Trice is the Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of  Engage.cx.  Soon after beginning his career in technology, David saw how software could solve a complicated problem for business.  Within a few years he co-founded Revenue Technologies to deliver price optimization software to industry leaders such as Motorola and UPS, which was acquired by Oracle in 2007.
At Oracle, David’s vision and product management skills were recognized as he was tapped to lead the launch of Oracle’s next generation Fusion CRM.  With a deep understanding about the capabilities and limitations of existing CRM platforms, David recognized a void in the ability for companies to deliver consistent, productive and personalized customer engagements across all channels of interaction spanning digital and physical – a void that could not be addressed by existing technologies.
David teamed-up with Eric Bleke, and together they formed CX Technologies and soon after started building the ENGAGE.cx platform.
