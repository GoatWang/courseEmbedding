Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: May 19, 2001

 In early 1999, Calpine Corp.'s CEO Pete Cartwright adopted an aggressive growth strategy with the goal of increasing the company's aggregate generating capacity from approximately 3,000 to 15,000 megawatts (MW) by 2004. He believed there was a fleeting opportunity to repower America given the inefficiency and age of current generating capacity as well as the recently granted ability to compete in wholesale power markets. To achieve the new goal, Calpine will have to build or acquire as many as 25 power plants at a total cost of $6 billion (approximately $500,000 per 1,000 MW). For a company with assets of $1.7 billion, a subinvestment grade debt rating, a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 79%, and an after-tax cash flow of $143 million in 1998, raising this much money was going to be a formidable challenge.

Calpine to Acquire Noble Americas Energy Solutions, Significantly 
      Enhancing Retail Energy Platform




Strategic and Financial Highlights:



        Best-in-class commercial and industrial retail electricity provider in 
        the U.S.
      

        Complements Calpine’s existing wholesale power generation footprint
      

        Approx. $700 million net cash deployed represents approx. 5x Adjusted 
        EBITDA
      

        Highly free cash flow and credit accretive transaction
      






October 09, 2016 07:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Calpine Corporation (NYSE:CPN) announced today that it has entered into 
      an agreement to purchase Noble Americas Energy Solutions, LLC (NAES), 
      the nation’s largest independent supplier of power to commercial and 
      industrial retail customers, for a purchase price of $800 million plus 
      an estimated $100 million of net working capital at closing. Calpine 
      expects to recover approximately $200 million through collateral 
      synergies and the runoff of acquired legacy hedges, substantially within 
      the first year, resulting in expected net cash deployed of approximately 
      $700 million (including working capital), or approximately five times 
      NAES’ recent and expected run-rate Adjusted EBITDA.
    


      “We are excited to be acquiring the best commercial and industrial 
      direct energy sales platform in the U.S. The acquisition of this 
      well-regarded organization known for providing sophisticated customers 
      with highly customized products is a natural fit with Calpine’s 
      customer-centric culture and will allow us to build upon the success we 
      have experienced since our entry into retail last year through the 
      Champion Energy platform,” said Thad Hill, Calpine’s President and Chief 
      Executive Officer. “In addition to expanding our retail customer sales 
      channels and product offerings, we will more than double the volume of 
      retail load we are capable of serving across the country from our 
      complementary wholesale power generation fleet.
    

      “Financially, this transaction is highly cash flow and credit accretive, 
      given a rapidly amortizing bridge loan, the achievement of collateral 
      synergies and the ongoing generation of stable and substantial cash 
      flows,” concluded Hill. “In addition to delivering strong annual cash 
      flow, the strong sales effort by the NAES team has continued to build 
      the mark-to-market value of their book over the last several years, 
      which will help ensure future success of the business. We look forward 
      to welcoming the entire NAES team to the Calpine family.”
    

NAES


      NAES currently serves commercial and industrial customers in 18 states 
      nationwide, including California, Texas, the Mid-Atlantic and 
      Northeastern United States, where Calpine’s wholesale power generation 
      fleet is primarily concentrated. The organization will remain 
      headquartered in San Diego and will continue to operate under the 
      leadership of Jim Wood, President of NAES.
    

      “We are thrilled to be joining the Calpine team,” said Wood. “Our 
      customers should know that we will continue to provide the same high 
      level of services and product offerings during the ownership transition 
      and, when under the Calpine banner, we expect to provide even greater 
      value-added products and services.”
    

Funding and Credit Support


      Calpine expects to fund the acquisition with a combination of cash on 
      hand and temporary bridge loan financing of up to $550 million. The 
      company intends to repay the bridge facility during 2017 with proceeds 
      from announced asset sales as well as cash from operations, including 
      that generated from the anticipated collateral synergies.
    

      Under Calpine ownership, anticipated collateral needs are expected to be 
      met with approximately $240 million in letters of credit and $20 million 
      of surety bonds, leaving almost $1.2 billion of Calpine Corporate 
      Revolver capacity remaining at closing.
    

Approvals and Time to Close


      Calpine will acquire the business from Noble Americas Gas & Power Corp., 
      a subsidiary of Noble Group Ltd. The transaction is expected to close by 
      year end 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, approval by 
      shareholders of Noble Group Ltd., approval from the Federal Energy 
      Regulatory Commission and antitrust review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino 
      Act.
    

About Calpine


      Calpine Corporation is America’s largest generator of electricity from 
      natural gas and geothermal resources. Our fleet of 84 power plants in 
      operation or under construction represents more than 27,000 megawatts of 
      generation capacity. Serving customers in 20 states and Canada, we 
      specialize in developing, constructing, owning and operating natural 
      gas-fired and renewable geothermal power plants that use advanced

      uniquely positioned to benefit from the secular trends affecting our 
      industry, including the abundant and affordable supply of clean natural 
      gas, stricter environmental regulation, aging power generation 
      infrastructure and the increasing need for dispatchable power plants to 
      successfully integrate intermittent renewables into the grid. We focus

Power characteristics[edit]
Its fleet of 80 power plants in operation or under construction represents approximately 26,000 megawatts of generation capacity.
In 2016, while M.J. Bradley & Associates ranked Calpine as the nation’s 10th largest power producer, it ranked the company 79th, 78th and 72nd with regard to emissions of SO2, NOx and CO2, respectively, with no mercury emissions in its gas-fired fleet.[2] These results reflect efficient operation of a modern fleet with no coal-fired generation.
Calpine’s predominantly gas-fired fleet also benefits from the nations’ abundant and affordable supply of natural gas and the increasing need for dispatchable power plants to successfully integrate intermittent renewables into the grid. The company advocates for responsible environmental regulation, competitive wholesale power markets and market-driven solutions that result in nondiscriminatory forward price signals for investors.[3]
Operations[edit]
Through wholesale power operations and its retail businesses, Calpine Energy Solutions (formerly Noble Americas Energy Solutions) and Champion Energy, Calpine serves customers in 25 states, Canada and Mexico.[4]
As of 2016, the directors of Calpine are Board Chairman Frank Cassidy, CEO Thad Hill, Laurie Brlas, Jack A. Fusco, Michael W. Hoffmann, David C. Merritt, W. Benjamin Moreland, Robert A. Mosbacher, Jr., and Denise M. O'Leary. The executive leadership team includes President/CEO Thad Hill, EVP/Chief Legal Officer Thad Miller, EVP/Chief Financial Officer Zamir Rauf, EVP/Chief Commercial Officer Trey Griggs and EVP/Power Operations Charlie Gates.
History[edit]
In response to the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis, much legislation was passed that made domestic energy production an attractive enterprise. In 1984, Peter Cartwright and four of his co-workers, the Guy F. Atkinson Construction Company of South San Francisco, and the Electrowatt corporation struck an investment arrangement, and Calpine was born with initial capital of US$1 million. It was essentially a Silicon Valley startup company. The name "Calpine" is derived from the company's original California location and alpine, a reference to the Zürich home base of Electrowatt. Calpine is the largest generator of electricity from natural gas and geothermal resources in the United States.

1984: provider of management services for independent energy companies
1988: first power production
1992: assets of US $21 billion
1994: 141 MW capacity
1996: largest IPO ever for an independent energy company
1998: purchased 45 gas turbine power plants
1999: purchased 18 gas turbine power plants
1999: acquired PG&E's plants at The Geysers, making Calpine the world's largest geothermal provider[5]
2001: the California electricity crisis
2004: Investment bank Lehman Brothers begins shorting Calpine, with researcher Christine Daley lacking confidence in the Calpine. This information spreads to clients of Lehman. By the time Calpine goes bankrupt in 2005, Lehman will profit roughly $100,000,000 from the short.[6]
2005: November: CEO Peter Cartwright and CFO Bob Kelly leave the company.[7]
2005: December 20: Calpine files bankruptcy, US$22 billion in debt.[8] Calpine's aggressive leveraged expansion plan was unsupportable in the economic environment formed by the 2000-2001 California energy crisis and the collapse of Enron. Stock price dropped to less than US$0.30 per share. Delisted from NYSE.[9][7]
2008: On 1/31/08, Calpine emerges from bankruptcy. Previous stock was exchanged for warrants. New Calpine stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "CPN."
2008: Executive leadership team headed by President and CEO Jack Fusco join the company.
2009: Moved corporate headquarters from San Jose, California to Houston, Texas.
2010: Acquired Conectiv Energy (generation) from Pepco Holdings[10][11]
2010: Calpine dedicates the Geothermal Visitor Center and celebrates 50 years of geothermal power production at The Geysers in Northern California.
2010: Thad Hill is named Chief Operating Officer.
2012: Calpine’s power plant fleet generates a record 116 million MWh of electricity.
2013: Calpine rings the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on January 18.
2014: Jack Fusco becomes Calpine’s Executive Chairman of the Board and Thad Hill becomes the company’s Chief Executive Officer effective May 21.
2014: Calpine executes on a strategic priority by selling six power plants in its Southeast region.
2015: Calpine acquired award-winning retail electric provider Champion Energy, expanding customer channels in its core Texas and Northeastern U.S. markets.

Power characteristics[edit]
Its fleet of 80 power plants in operation or under construction represents approximately 26,000 megawatts of generation capacity.
In 2016, while M.J. Bradley & Associates ranked Calpine as the nation’s 10th largest power producer, it ranked the company 79th, 78th and 72nd with regard to emissions of SO2, NOx and CO2, respectively, with no mercury emissions in its gas-fired fleet.[2] These results reflect efficient operation of a modern fleet with no coal-fired generation.
Calpine’s predominantly gas-fired fleet also benefits from the nations’ abundant and affordable supply of natural gas and the increasing need for dispatchable power plants to successfully integrate intermittent renewables into the grid. The company advocates for responsible environmental regulation, competitive wholesale power markets and market-driven solutions that result in nondiscriminatory forward price signals for investors.[3]
Operations[edit]
Through wholesale power operations and its retail businesses, Calpine Energy Solutions (formerly Noble Americas Energy Solutions) and Champion Energy, Calpine serves customers in 25 states, Canada and Mexico.[4]
As of 2016, the directors of Calpine are Board Chairman Frank Cassidy, CEO Thad Hill, Laurie Brlas, Jack A. Fusco, Michael W. Hoffmann, David C. Merritt, W. Benjamin Moreland, Robert A. Mosbacher, Jr., and Denise M. O'Leary. The executive leadership team includes President/CEO Thad Hill, EVP/Chief Legal Officer Thad Miller, EVP/Chief Financial Officer Zamir Rauf, EVP/Chief Commercial Officer Trey Griggs and EVP/Power Operations Charlie Gates.
History[edit]
In response to the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis, much legislation was passed that made domestic energy production an attractive enterprise. In 1984, Peter Cartwright and four of his co-workers, the Guy F. Atkinson Construction Company of South San Francisco, and the Electrowatt corporation struck an investment arrangement, and Calpine was born with initial capital of US$1 million. It was essentially a Silicon Valley startup company. The name "Calpine" is derived from the company's original California location and alpine, a reference to the Zürich home base of Electrowatt. Calpine is the largest generator of electricity from natural gas and geothermal resources in the United States.

1984: provider of management services for independent energy companies
1988: first power production
1992: assets of US $21 billion
1994: 141 MW capacity
1996: largest IPO ever for an independent energy company
1998: purchased 45 gas turbine power plants
1999: purchased 18 gas turbine power plants
1999: acquired PG&E's plants at The Geysers, making Calpine the world's largest geothermal provider[5]
2001: the California electricity crisis
2004: Investment bank Lehman Brothers begins shorting Calpine, with researcher Christine Daley lacking confidence in the Calpine. This information spreads to clients of Lehman. By the time Calpine goes bankrupt in 2005, Lehman will profit roughly $100,000,000 from the short.[6]
2005: November: CEO Peter Cartwright and CFO Bob Kelly leave the company.[7]
2005: December 20: Calpine files bankruptcy, US$22 billion in debt.[8] Calpine's aggressive leveraged expansion plan was unsupportable in the economic environment formed by the 2000-2001 California energy crisis and the collapse of Enron. Stock price dropped to less than US$0.30 per share. Delisted from NYSE.[9][7]
2008: On 1/31/08, Calpine emerges from bankruptcy. Previous stock was exchanged for warrants. New Calpine stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "CPN."
2008: Executive leadership team headed by President and CEO Jack Fusco join the company.
2009: Moved corporate headquarters from San Jose, California to Houston, Texas.
2010: Acquired Conectiv Energy (generation) from Pepco Holdings[10][11]
2010: Calpine dedicates the Geothermal Visitor Center and celebrates 50 years of geothermal power production at The Geysers in Northern California.
2010: Thad Hill is named Chief Operating Officer.
2012: Calpine’s power plant fleet generates a record 116 million MWh of electricity.
2013: Calpine rings the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on January 18.
2014: Jack Fusco becomes Calpine’s Executive Chairman of the Board and Thad Hill becomes the company’s Chief Executive Officer effective May 21.
2014: Calpine executes on a strategic priority by selling six power plants in its Southeast region.
2015: Calpine acquired award-winning retail electric provider Champion Energy, expanding customer channels in its core Texas and Northeastern U.S. markets.
2016: Calpine acquired Granite Ridge Energy Center in Londonderry, New Hampshire.
2016: Frank Cassidy becomes Chairman of the Board.
2016: Calpine acquired Noble Group Ltd's North American energy business. [12]

Power characteristics[edit]
Its fleet of 80 power plants in operation or under construction represents approximately 26,000 megawatts of generation capacity.
In 2016, while M.J. Bradley & Associates ranked Calpine as the nation’s 10th largest power producer, it ranked the company 79th, 78th and 72nd with regard to emissions of SO2, NOx and CO2, respectively, with no mercury emissions in its gas-fired fleet.[2] These results reflect efficient operation of a modern fleet with no coal-fired generation.
Calpine’s predominantly gas-fired fleet also benefits from the nations’ abundant and affordable supply of natural gas and the increasing need for dispatchable power plants to successfully integrate intermittent renewables into the grid. The company advocates for responsible environmental regulation, competitive wholesale power markets and market-driven solutions that result in nondiscriminatory forward price signals for investors.[3]
Operations[edit]
Through wholesale power operations and its retail businesses, Calpine Energy Solutions (formerly Noble Americas Energy Solutions) and Champion Energy, Calpine serves customers in 25 states, Canada and Mexico.[4]
As of 2016, the directors of Calpine are Board Chairman Frank Cassidy, CEO Thad Hill, Laurie Brlas, Jack A. Fusco, Michael W. Hoffmann, David C. Merritt, W. Benjamin Moreland, Robert A. Mosbacher, Jr., and Denise M. O'Leary. The executive leadership team includes President/CEO Thad Hill, EVP/Chief Legal Officer Thad Miller, EVP/Chief Financial Officer Zamir Rauf, EVP/Chief Commercial Officer Trey Griggs and EVP/Power Operations Charlie Gates.
History[edit]
In response to the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis, much legislation was passed that made domestic energy production an attractive enterprise. In 1984, Peter Cartwright and four of his co-workers, the Guy F. Atkinson Construction Company of South San Francisco, and the Electrowatt corporation struck an investment arrangement, and Calpine was born with initial capital of US$1 million. It was essentially a Silicon Valley startup company. The name "Calpine" is derived from the company's original California location and alpine, a reference to the Zürich home base of Electrowatt. Calpine is the largest generator of electricity from natural gas and geothermal resources in the United States.

1984: provider of management services for independent energy companies
1988: first power production
1992: assets of US $21 billion
1994: 141 MW capacity
1996: largest IPO ever for an independent energy company
1998: purchased 45 gas turbine power plants
1999: purchased 18 gas turbine power plants
1999: acquired PG&E's plants at The Geysers, making Calpine the world's largest geothermal provider[5]
2001: the California electricity crisis
2004: Investment bank Lehman Brothers begins shorting Calpine, with researcher Christine Daley lacking confidence in the Calpine. This information spreads to clients of Lehman. By the time Calpine goes bankrupt in 2005, Lehman will profit roughly $100,000,000 from the short.[6]
2005: November: CEO Peter Cartwright and CFO Bob Kelly leave the company.[7]
2005: December 20: Calpine files bankruptcy, US$22 billion in debt.[8] Calpine's aggressive leveraged expansion plan was unsupportable in the economic environment formed by the 2000-2001 California energy crisis and the collapse of Enron. Stock price dropped to less than US$0.30 per share. Delisted from NYSE.[9][7]
2008: On 1/31/08, Calpine emerges from bankruptcy. Previous stock was exchanged for warrants. New Calpine stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "CPN."
2008: Executive leadership team headed by President and CEO Jack Fusco join the company.
2009: Moved corporate headquarters from San Jose, California to Houston, Texas.
2010: Acquired Conectiv Energy (generation) from Pepco Holdings[10][11]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
