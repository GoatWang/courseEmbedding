                Welcome to Rowe Financial Advisors. Our mission is to help clients accumulate, manage
                and preserve wealth. We recognize that effective wealth management and financial
                security are closely linked. We get to know our clients, help them to define their
                family and personal goals (along with business goals where appropriate), and then
                create a financial plan to move them toward those goals. 

                We meet regularly with clients so that we understand how their goals and circumstances
                change over time. We can adjust financial plans over time to match evolving personal
                goals and developments along with changing market conditions.

                We think of our services as being something like a compass. We give clients insight
                into the direction they should take in order to have long-term financial peace of
                mind. We help our clients understand the lay of the financial landscape, and work
                with them to adapt in ways that help them meet their goals.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
