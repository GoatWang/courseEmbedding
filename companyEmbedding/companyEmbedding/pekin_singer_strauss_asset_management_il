Our experienced investment team will work closely with you to develop and execute a bespoke financial plan with an investment portfolio customized to meet your long-term financial goals. Learn How 







Disciplined Value Investing Approach
			We take a contrarian value investing approach because we believe it leads to more investment situations where we are buying low in order to sell high at a later date.  By investing in quality financial assets that are already undervalued, in our view, we provide protection against downside risk and create value creation opportunities for our clients.  Our value investing approach is supported by a significant body of research demonstrating that value stocks have outperformed growth stocks and the market over the past one hundred years.

How We Invest 







Experienced Investment Advisors
			We are a research and investment-driven firm, with eight CFA charterholders on our investment team, many of which have graduated from top business schools, including Stanford, Wharton, and University of Chicago. Our investment professionals are analytical, contrarian, value-oriented, independent, intellectually honest, and dedicated to helping our clients meet their financial goals..See Our Full Team

Investment Principles
We are value investors who seek to generate market-­beating returns by making prudent, disciplined investments on behalf of our investors. With our investment approach, we adhere to a core set of investment principles:

Protect capital from permanent impairment
Be contrarian
Use prudence with financial leverage
Diversify your asset classes
Seek a margin of safety with your capital commitments
Be wary of "this time is different" statements

All of these principles add up to an investment philosophy that is value oriented and that we believe will lead to above average returns over the long haul while limiting risk. 





Alignment with Our Investors
When it comes to investing, we "eat our own cooking". Portfolio managers have invested their personal capital in firm strategies along with our investors. By investing alongside our clients, we believe we are better aligned with our clients and more disciplined in our decision making.

Equities
A suitable segment of a client's portfolio is allocated to high quality stocks for long-term capital appreciation. When we choose a company's stock for a client's portfolio, we are disciplined with our purchase price and generally seek to invest in situations that present a favorable risk-reward profile.









Fixed Income Securities
Our approach to fixed income investing balances the desire to generate a reliable stream of income for our clients (and confidence that the principal amount invested will be repaid) against the risks associated with committing capital for a fixed rate of return. Our view of the macro-economic environment, together with the potential interest rate risk and credit risk, is critical to our strategic approach to fixed income investing.









Alternative Private Investments
Certain clients have expressed their desire to allocate a portion of their capital into private, alternative investments. Through our relationships, from time to time, we see interesting alternative investment opportunities, such as real estate and private equity, and we introduce such ideas to clients. These investments are often managed by individuals and firms with expertise complementary to our own. As is the case with our equity investments, we like to invest our own capital in alternative investment opportunities alongside our clients.









Precious Metals
In an effort to hedge our client portfolio for risk and provide inflation protection for our client portfolios, we seek out appropriate commodity investments that we can purchase for our clients through the public markets.









Mutual Funds
We try to use mutual funds and ETFs sparingly to keep our clients' investment expenses low. When we invest our clients' capital in Appleseed Fund, whose investment portfolio we manage ourselves, we waive Pekin Singer's investment advisory fee. We generally limit our investments in mutual funds to small accounts that are difficult to diversify with individual securities and to asset classes in which the expertise of a third party manager is required.

March 28, 2016
The financial services industry is constantly developing new products to serve the ever-changing wants and needs of a diverse array of investors. While Wall Street financial innovation often leads to problems (e.g., the exotic mortgage debt instruments that helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis), investment banks occasionally launch new products worthy of investor’s attention. We think green bonds are an interesting product that is worth considering.
Green bonds, like traditional bonds, are fixed income instruments that are used by governments, companies, and NGOs to raise capital through the debt markets. Their structure is not fundamentally different from the corporate bonds, government bonds, and municipal bonds with which many of us are familiar. However, green bonds differ from traditional bonds in that the issuers of green bonds publicly state that the capital raised through the issue will fund projects, assets, or business activities with an environmental benefit. These activities might include renewable energy, sustainable forestry, or energy-efficiency projects, to name a few examples. Also, capital might be used to fund projects with social or community benefits, such as improving social services or increasing accessibility to healthcare. In order to provide transparency to bondholders, green bond issuers typically provide periodic reporting on the use of funds and project success, though such reporting is not currently a requirement.
While green bonds are a relatively new phenomenon (the first green bond was issued in 2007 by the European Investment Bank), the global green bond market has grown from $810 million in 2007 to an estimated $95 billion at the end of 2015. With new issuers and investors continuing to enter the market, the total value of green bonds outstanding is expected to climb as high as $158 billion worldwide by the end of 2016. While there is currently no standardized set of criteria for what qualifies a bond as “green” we expect this to change as the market develops. Several international organizations have developed guidelines that issuers are encouraged to follow in order to be able to label their bonds as “green.” We expect that a single international green bond standard will emerge in the near future, which should only add to the credibility and size of the green bond market.
For example, Apple Inc. recently entered the green bond market, issuing $1.5 billion in bonds in February 2016, with the proceeds used to finance renewable energy, energy storage and energy efficiency projects, green buildings, and resource conservation efforts. Apple is undertaking these projects in order to reduce the company’s carbon footprint and the carbon footprint of its supply chain. In issuing these bonds, Apple developed a green bond framework which was reviewed by a third party consultancy, while Ernst & Young was hired to conduct an annual audit to determine how the bond proceeds were used.
At Pekin Singer Strauss Asset Management, we have been helping our clients align their investment portfolios with their personal values for many years, and we continue to make this an integral part of our investment process. We have deep experience in values-based and socially responsible investing that has given us unique insight into how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can be integrated into investment analysis. For some clients, this has meant avoiding certain companies or industries, while for others it has meant investing in private, impact-focused alternative investments. Green bonds provide yet another opportunity for our clients to direct their capital in ways that align with their values.
In order to help our clients capitalize on the opportunities that green bonds represent, we have developed relationships with several bond vendors who maintain substantial inventories of green bonds that we can purchase for our clients who wish to be involved in this type of investment. If you are interested in investing in green bonds or would like to learn more about them, please reach out to us to discuss how they might fit into your financial plan and your investment portfolio.

pagePekin Singer Strauss is a research-driven boutique asset management firm that provides customized portfolio management services and personal financial advice.Our CompanyOur HistoryOur TeamWhy Pekin SingerCommunity Involvement 










Twenty Five Years of Investing
Pekin Singer Strauss Asset Management was founded in 1990 by Rick Singer, Nate Shapiro, Joanne Pekin, and Shelly Pekin. The firm has grown in size as clients have referred their friends and family members. From a standing start a quarter of a century ago, Pekin Singer currently manages over $800 million of investors' capital in separately managed accounts, in Appleseed Fund, an actively managed mutual fund launched in 2006, and a private fund.
Our value proposition today remains the same. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our clients through a prudent value investing approach, and we seek to treat each and every client with individualized attention and sophisticated personal advice.
Schedule a consultation. Get Started Today.
Contact Us 





Founding Investment Principles
The principles upon which our firm was created remain the bedrock upon which we manage the assets of our clients. These principles, just briefly, are:

Protect the integrity of the capital you are managing
Be contrarian
Use prudence when it comes to companies with debt leverage
Seek a margin of safety with your capital commitments
Be wary of "this time is different" statements

These principles provide the contours of a disciplined investment philosophy that, we believe, has the potential to generate above average returns over the long term while limiting downside exposure. 





Clients First
Pekin Singer is a closely knit firm that has grown over the past quarter century as our founding clients, primarily family and friends, have referred their family and friends to us.
We do not employ salespeople to manage our private clients; our clients and our clients' portfolios are managed by experienced investors who put our clients first and are dedicated to helping clients achieve their long term financial goals.
Our client services team bends over backwards to provide our clients with outstanding service that exceeds their expectations. We strive to provide our clients with a level of personal service and assistance that is difficult to find elsewhere.

Offering Day Passes
Scale your support without burning holes in your pocket
The next time you need a couple of extra hands on high-traffic support days or before any D-day, simply use day passes by Freshservice to temporarily add extra agents whenever you need them. You could just add your super-users as occasional agents, define their roles, and they are good to go. Use the day pass for each day they need access to your support desk instead of spending on a full-time agent for a few hours' or days' of work.

Sorry, there isn’t really anything here.


			We are customers too, and boy, do we HATE guys that nickel-and-dime...
		

			So with Freshservice, you pay for exactly what you sign up for and that’s that. No extras, no under-the-rug, no balderdash...

Get PersonalizedInvestment Expertise
			With your life savings, you want to work with an investor who truly understands your financial picture and who will listen to you. Our experienced investment team will work closely with you to develop and execute a bespoke financial plan with an investment portfolio customized to meet your long-term financial goals. Learn How 







Disciplined Value Investing Approach
			We take a contrarian value investing approach because we believe it leads to more investment situations where we are buying low in order to sell high at a later date.  By investing in quality financial assets that are already undervalued, in our view, we provide protection against downside risk and create value creation opportunities for our clients.  Our value investing approach is supported by a significant body of research demonstrating that value stocks have outperformed growth stocks and the market over the past one hundred years.
