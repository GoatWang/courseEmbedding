I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") against SEI Investments Distribution Company ("SIDCO"), and that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act against SEI Investments Company ("SEI") (collectively, the "Respondents").
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers of Settlement (the "Offers"), which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings  herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Order"), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents' Offers, the Commission finds that:
Respondents
1.	SEI Investments Distribution Company has been registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer since 1982, and maintains its headquarters in Oaks, Pennsylvania.  SIDCO is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEI.  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, SIDCO reported net income of approximately $16 million.
2.	SEI Investments Company is a Pennsylvania corporation with its headquarters in Oaks, Pennsylvania.  SEI is not registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer or investment adviser.  SEI Investments Management Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEI, is an investment adviser registered with the Commission.  SEI, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, administers $254 billion in mutual fund and pooled assets, manages almost $90 billion in assets, and processes almost $50 trillion of investment transactions annually.  SEI's common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and is listed on the NASDAQ National Market and trades under the symbol "SEIC".  
Background
3.	This matter involves violations by SEI's wholly-owned subsidiary, SIDCO, of the net capital, customer protection, reporting, and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act, and SEI's causing of SIDCO's violations.   
4.	SIDCO acts as both an introducing broker, distributing shares in various mutual funds, and formerly acted as an intermediary broker between institutional clients and government securities dealers in repurchase agreement transactions.  In its role as an intermediary broker, SIDCO has custody of customer funds and securities.  SIDCO has a commission recapture/rebate program where customers are rebated a portion of their commission dollars.  SIDCO also provides directed brokerage services, which allows it to pay a portion of customers' expenses out of commission monies.  
5.	In August 2002, the NASD conducted a routine examination of SIDCO, finding that its books and records were incomplete and its net capital computations were inaccurate.  In particular, the NASD identified issues relating to an account for the exclusive benefit of customers established under Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i) of the Exchange Act, including the commingling of customer funds and SIDCO's failure to include this account in its financial records, as well as SIDCO's failure to include certain error accounts in its books and records.  At that time, SIDCO informed the NASD that it would correct these problems.  In fact, it did not.  
6.	In April 2003, the staff conducted a cause examination of SIDCO's directed brokerage and commission rebate programs. The staff concluded that SIDCO had not remedied the problems previously noted by the NASD and many of the problems, including the commingling of customer funds, remained.    
7.	The examiners concluded that SIDCO incorrectly had calculated and reported its net capital from at least September 2002 through February 2003.  In particular, SIDCO's failure to reflect a balance of over $94 million in an account established under Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i),1  used for SIDCO's repurchase agreement program2 (the "(k)(2)(i) account") as both an allowable asset and as an aggregate indebtedness liability at month end February 28, 2003, resulted in an increase in SIDCO's minimum required net capital of $6,267,444, which caused the company to fall below its 120% minimum net capital requirement for that month.  SIDCO failed to timely notify the Commission of this net capital deficiency as required by Rule 17a-11(c)(3) of the Exchange Act.
8.	In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2002, SIDCO reported net capital of more than $8 million, when based upon its books and records at that time, it should have reported negative net capital of $53 million.  This net capital deficiency was largely due to an overdraft of approximately $61.9 million that occurred on December 31, 20023  as a result of a transaction in the (k)(2)(i) account by SEI Investments Management Corporation ("SIMCO"),4  through its activities as transfer agent for SEI mutual funds and certain non-SEI mutual funds.5
9.	This SIMCO-related transaction in SIDCO's (k)(2)(i) account resulted from the fact that the account was being used for cash movements in connection with both SIDCO and SIMCO transactions.  This commingling of customers' funds with funds belonging to shareholders of the various mutual funds resulted in SIDCO's failure to maintain its exemption from the provisions of Rule 15c3-3 under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of the rule.6
10.	SIDCO failed to make and keep current accurate books and records reflecting all assets and liabilities from at least September 2002 through February 2003.  Specifically, SIDCO failed to include several accounts in its books and records and, conversely, erroneously included accounts in its books and records that did not belong to SIDCO but, rather, to SEI's transfer agent.  The accounts not included in SIDCO's records consisted of two accounts for the exclusive benefit of customers under Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i), at least eleven error accounts, and at least eight clearing accounts.  The accounts erroneously included on SIDCO's books and records included two accounts in its general ledger that belonged to SIMCO.  SIDCO did not notify the Commission of its failure to make and keep current books and records as required by Rule 17a-11(d) of the Exchange Act.
11.	As a result of its failure to accurately reflect all assets and liabilities on its books and records, SIDCO materially misstated its net capital in certain monthly FOCUS reports filed with the Commission from at least September 2002 through February 2003.
12.       By omitting the (k)(2)(i) account from its financial records, SIDCO materially misstated its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002.  SIDCO reported positive net worth of more than $60 million and net capital of more than $8 million when based upon its books and records at that time, it should have reported a negative net worth of approximately $1.5 million, and negative net capital of over $53 million.  SIDCO failed to file a Rule 17a-11 notification letter as required by Rule 17a-11(b)(1) of the Exchange Act to report this net capital deficiency, which has since been eliminated.  
13.	In addition, in its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002, SIDCO incorrectly reported that it had maintained its exemption from the provisions of Rule 15c3-3.
14.	As SIDCO's parent company, SEI was ultimately responsible for the reliability and completeness of SIDCO's books and records.  SEI effectively controlled SIDCO's functions and activities.  SIDCO shared SEI's clients and facilities, and even some of SEI's officers.  These officers, which included SIDCO's former chief financial officer and general counsel, also held positions at SEI.  In addition, SIDCO's former Board consisted solely of individuals who were also officers and directors of SEI.  Despite this overlapping of directors and officers, and apparent control exerted by SEI over SIDCO, the staff found that inadequate time and attention was devoted to the operations of SIDCO, resulting in the violations discussed above.  
15.	In particular, little attention was given to SIDCO's books and records, causing SIDCO to fail to include several accounts in its books and records, and improperly including accounts in its books and records that belonged to SIMCO.  One account, which was not included in SIDCO's books and records or any books and records of any SEI affiliated entity, was the (k)(2)(i) account in which customer funds were commingled with funds belonging to shareholders of various mutual funds.  
16.	Since the staff's examination, SIDCO has taken corrective action on several fronts with respect to the financial and operations concerns the staff raised, and continues to do so.  Among the more significant steps taken, SIDCO has hired a new president and a new Financial and Operations Principal; it has replaced its former general counsel and hired an adviser to the Board; and it has taken steps to formalize the Board's functions, including adding an independent director.  Further, as to the (k)(2)(i) account, SIDCO closed its repurchase agreement program as of October 24, 2003.  In addition, SIDCO has engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") to address the financial and operational issues raised by the staff, and to conduct a comprehensive review of SIDCO's operations, including SIDCO's business activities and organizational structure, as well as its record keeping and financial reporting processes.  In connection with this engagement, SIDCO has undertaken a comprehensive review of its accounts to ensure that all accounts have been included on SIDCO's books and records.    
Violations
17.	As a result of the conduct described above, SIDCO willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, which require that broker-dealers registered with the Commission make and keep for prescribed periods such records, furnish such copies thereof, and make and disseminate such reports as the Commission has prescribed as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, or for the protection of investors.  
18.	As a result of the conduct described above, SIDCO willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-5 thereunder, which require that broker-dealers registered with the Commission file with regulators periodic unaudited financial reports, or FOCUS reports, as well as an annual audited report that includes a statement of financial condition, statement of income, and a statement of changes in financial position.  SIDCO willfully violated Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-5 thereunder by filing inaccurate FOCUS reports from at least September 2002 through February 2003, and by filing inaccurate audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002.  
19.	As a result of the conduct described above, SIDCO, while doing business as a broker-dealer, willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-11(b)(1) thereunder, which require broker-dealers registered with the Commission whose net capital declines below the minimum amount required to give notice to the Commission of such deficiency that same day.  
20.	As a result of the conduct described above, SIDCO, while doing business as a broker-dealer, willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-11(c)(3) thereunder, which require broker-dealers registered with the Commission whose total net capital is less than 120 percent of the broker-dealer's required minimum net capital to give notice promptly to the Commission.
21.	As a result of the conduct described above, SIDCO, while doing business as a broker-dealer, willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-11(d) thereunder, which require broker-dealers registered with the Commission to give notice to the Commission of their failure to make and keep current prescribed books and records.
22.	As a result of the conduct described above, SIDCO, while doing business as a broker-dealer, willfully violated Section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15c3-1 and 15c3-3 thereunder, which require broker-dealers to (a) have and maintain sufficient net capital; and (b) maintain bank accounts for the benefit of customers separate from any other bank account.  
23.        As a result of the conduct described above, SEI caused SIDCO's violations of Sections 15(c)(3) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15c3-1, 15c3-3, 17a-3, 17a-5 and 17a-11 thereunder in that it knew or should have known that its acts would contribute to SIDCO's violations.
Remedial Efforts
24.	In determining to accept the Offers, the Commission considered the remedial acts as described in Paragraph 16 above and cooperation afforded to the Commission staff.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions specified in the Offers of Respondents SIDCO and SEI.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.	Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, SIDCO is hereby censured.
B.	Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, SIDCO shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 15(c)(3) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15c3-1, 15c3-3, 17a-3, 17a-5 and 17a-11 thereunder.
C.	SIDCO shall, within ten days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $375,000 to the United States Treasury.  Such payment shall be: (A) made by United States postal money order, certified check, bank cashier's check or bank money order; (B) made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission; (C) hand-delivered or mailed to the Office of Financial Management, Securities and Exchange Commission, Operations Center, 6432 General Green Way, Stop 0-3, Alexandria, VA 22312; and (D) submitted under cover letter that identifies SIDCO as a Respondent in these proceedings, the file number of these proceedings, a copy of which cover letter and money order or check shall be sent to Arthur S.

Upon written request and good cause being shown, the staff or Deloitte may grant SIDCO such additional time as the staff or Deloitte deems necessary to submit these reports.

Upon written request and good cause being shown, the staff may grant SIDCO such additional time as the staff deems necessary to submit an affidavit.   
SIDCO shall require Deloitte to review SIDCO's implementation of the recommendations contained in Deloitte's report, or such alternatives proposed in writing by SIDCO and accepted in writing by Deloitte or the staff.

SIDCO shall require that within 30 days after the commencement of such review, Deloitte shall report its findings to the staff and SIDCO.  Upon good cause being shown, the staff may grant Deloitte such additional time as the staff deems necessary to submit its report. 

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, SEI cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 15(c)(3) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15c3-1, 15c3-3, 17a-3, 17a-5 and 17a-11 thereunder.

Endnotes

1 Rule 15c3-3 requires a broker-dealer not exempt from the rule to establish a segregated bank account for the exclusive benefit of customers, in which the broker-dealer deposits funds or qualified securities in the amount by which customer credits exceed customer debits based on a specified formula.  One of the primary purposes of Rule 15c3-3 is to ensure that a broker-dealer does not place at risk assets belonging to its customers.  Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i) exempts a broker-dealer from performing a customer reserve formula computation under Rule 15c3-3 if, among other things, the broker-dealer promptly transmits all funds and delivers all securities received in connection with its activities as a broker-dealer.  A broker-dealer that operates under Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i) must establish a bank account (a "(k)(2)(i) account") to temporarily hold customer funds or securities.
2 SIDCO operated a tri-party repurchase agreement program, in which SIDCO acted as agent on behalf of its institutional customers bringing together participating sellers and purchasers in repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements (collectively, "repos") under standard written tri-party repurchase agreements.
3 The $61.9 million overdraft was caused by a series of erroneous entries relating to the execution on December 31, 2002 of an investor's SEI money-market mutual fund share sell instruction as a buy instruction.
4 SIMCO, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEI, is an investment adviser registered with the Commission.  It is the transfer agent to SEI Funds and City National's CNI Charter Funds.
5 The term "SEI mutual funds" refers to the SEI denominated manager of managers mutual fund complex, a series of mutual funds advised by SIMCO; SIMCO selects the sub-advisers for these funds.  SIMCO and SIDCO, respectively, provide administrative and distribution services to both SEI and non-SEI mutual funds.  
6 The exemption afforded by paragraph (k)(2)(i) requires a broker-dealer to maintain the complete separation of customer funds.  The commingling of SIDCO customer funds with non-SIDCO customer funds violated this separation.

See your investments through a new lens


Goals first, financials second. On the
    surface, that seems obvious. But if
    you're like other wealthy individuals,
    you might be surprised at the gap
    between your goals and the wealth
    you've set aside to attain them. Having
    clearly defined goals is what anchors
    your investment decisions. Combine
    that with advice focused on achieving
    your desired outcomes, and you have
    the most complete picture of
    your wealth possible - and all the
    confidence that goes with it.

This isn't about risk/return objectives - that's math. This is about identifying and articulating what you want, and how that matches (or doesn't) the wants of your family members. What's keeping you up at night may be what's keeping you from making decisions. When you're able get to the heart of what matters, you begin to understand how your answers impact your family, your community, and you.


Initiate a plan to get it done.


Your personal success is not defined
        by a portfolio or its benchmarks —
        it is defined by your ability to
        align your interests to your goals.
        We help you consider your wealth in the
        context of your life, then tether it to
        quantitative data — things like cash flow,
        assets, and liabilities. This approach brings
        organization, clarity and confidence
        to your decision-making. You know
        what success looks like because you've
        created a goals-based framework that
        structures your assets around your life.
        






Measure what's important
What you don't measure never gets done. Concise, customized, contextual reporting for each of your goals is critical to keep you on track and making the right decisions. It's the only way to make effective, impactful decisions around your wealth. Our tailored reporting aggregates your financials, and business and non-liquid assets, and aligns them to your goals — giving you the most informed view of progress towards your goals available anywhere.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

SEI headquarters in Oaks, PA.


SEI Investments Company, formerly Simulated Environments Inc, is a financial services company headquartered in Oaks, Pennsylvania, United States. The company describes itself as "a global provider of investment processing, investment management, and investment operations solutions".[1] SEI provides products and services to institutions, private banks, investment advisors, investment managers, and private clients.[2] SEI manages, advises or administers $779 billion in hedge funds, private equity, mutual funds and other managed assets. This includes $297 billion in assets under management and $478 billion in client assets under administration.[1]
SEI has corporate headquarters in Oaks, Pennsylvania with offices in Toronto, London, Dublin, The Netherlands, Hong Kong, South Africa, and Dubai.[3]
History[edit]
SEI was founded as Simulated Environments Inc in 1968 by its current Chairman and CEO, Alfred P. West, Jr. (also known as Al West). West had created the first computer-simulated training technology for loan officers.[citation needed] In the 1970s SEI developed an automated trust and investment accounting system for bank trust departments. In the 1990s SEI launched a wealth management operating platform for independent, fee-based investment advisors.[citation needed]
In 2012 SEI was sued by investors in connection with the financial crimes committed by Allen Stanford. Stanford had sold investors bogus Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and the investors alleged that SEI, as well as other companies, had promoted and misrepresented the CDs as safe investments without performing appropriate due diligence.[4][5] SEI responded that it merely provided a Stanford affiliate with back office services.[6] As of September 2015 the case was still ongoing.[5]
