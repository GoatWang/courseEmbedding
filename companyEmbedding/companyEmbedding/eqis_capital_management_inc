Asset Management — EQIS






























































 Asset ManagementYou can provide separately managed account portfolios customized to your clients’ goalsADVISORSAsset Management »Client AcquisitionAdministrative OutsourcingThought Leadership









Technology has changed the way we do just about everything. Now technology is changing the way we invest. For decades, wealthy individuals, family offices, endowments, and pension plans have typically gravitated toward separately managed accounts (SMAs) due to their many advantages over mutual funds and other pooled retail investment vehicles. EQIS delivers access to institutional money managers and directly owned securities in SMAs with an account minimum of only $25,000. Advantages include but are not limited to:Customized asset allocations are designed to match your clients’ risk tolerance and life objectivesOur risk tolerance questionnaire collects information necessary to help develop a robust, customized portfolio engineered to match to your clients’ needs, goals, and desires. Advisors can even further customize allocations based on their intimate knowledge of their clients.Broad diversificationYou can diversify a single account across many dimensions, including asset class, company size, value/growth stocks, geographic regions, emerging/developed markets, strategic/tactical investment philosophies, dividend rate, and others to help increase risk-adjusted return. *Institutional style money managersYou can deliver confidence and save time knowing money managers have all survived our stringent analyses of their methodologies, management, and return versus their benchmarks.Direct ownership of equity assetsYou can provide a directly owned, globally diversified portfolio of equities allocated across North America, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Socially responsible investingYou can appeal to investors’ consciences by offering to exclude individual companies, industries, and entire sectors at no additional charge. If, for example, your client doesn’t want to invest in cigarette companies, no problem. Investors can also reject specific equities based on purely financial considerations or any other criteria.Dynamic monitoring and rebalancingAccounts are monitored and rebalanced as necessary to help assure a continued match between their established objectives and investments.TransparencyYou and your clients can see every directly owned security and every trade made by the money managers. Even our fees are transparent.Tax efficiencyWhen investing in bundled products such as mutual funds, embedded capital gains are a common problem. When equities are directly owned, embedded capital gains can’t occur and individualized tax lot harvesting can even reduce taxes (1). 1. Bergstresser, D. (2002). Do after-tax returns affect mutual fund inflows? Journal of Financial Economics, 63, 381-414.









   *There can be specific risks associated with an investment in each of these specific asset categories. International investments involve special risks, including political and economic uncertainty, currency fluctuations, and different accounting practices. Please talk with your financial professional to discuss if these asset categories might be appropriate for your risk tolerance and goals

That is why she is now in charge of developing and reinforcing the EQIS company culture by ensuring that our family values - first laid out in 2014 - are remembered and threaded through everything that EQIS employees do. Jennifer is instrumental in helping improve the advisor experience on the EQIS platform, and she uses the mantra ‘every One-Ap is someone’s dream’, to remind everyone of the importance of what they are doing. Before taking charge of the advisor and employee experience, Jennifer acted as the Chief Compliance Officer for nine years. During that time she designed and implemented internal controls, policies, and procedures to help assure compliance with applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations, and with third-party guidelines. She managed audits and investigations into regulatory and compliance issues, and responded to requests for information from regulatory bodies.She holds a BA degree from Lewis University.
