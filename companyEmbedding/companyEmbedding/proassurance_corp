Your choice of ProAssurance reflects an appreciation of our commitment to treat you fairly.  We exist to protect others. Our history demonstrates companies of similar values coming together to ensure strong healthcare liability coverage, as well as other insurance options for our customers.
The timeline of our formation and major events includes:
2017
ProAssurance’s subsidiary, Eastern Alliance, purchases the renewal rights to Great Falls Insurance Company’s book of workers’ compensation business. The purchase expands Eastern’s operations into Maine, New Hampshire, and ultimately other New England states.
2015
ProAssurance forms ProAssurance American Mutual, A Risk Retention Group domiciled in Washington, D.C.  The Risk Retention Group provides ProAssurance with additional flexibility to service its customers with challenging and complex needs.
2014
ProAssurance introduces ProAssurance Complex Medicine (ProCxM), a new suite of excess insurance coverages and related services. With organizations retaining more of their own risk as they evolve to meet the complicated needs of the nation’s emerging healthcare delivery system, ProCxM enables effective solutions for those risks.
ProAssurance Risk Solutions begins operations, providing proven expertise to address complex risk financing challenges in both healthcare and workers’ compensation. Its focus is on run-off liabilities in M&A transactions and the assumption of existing reserve liabilities for large organizations seeking to repurpose capital resources.
ProAssurance becomes the majority capital provider to Syndicate 1729 at Lloyd's of London. This investment in Syndicate 1729’s operations expands ProAssurance’s commitment to writing the broadest range of healthcare-specific liability coverage, eventually enabling participation in carefully selected opportunities outside the U.S.
ProAssurance acquires Eastern Insurance Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded healthcare-centric writer of workers’ compensation insurance. Eastern has proven expertise in alterative risk transfer through its Inova program (via its Cayman-based subsidiary, Eastern Re). With the ability to provide our customers proven solutions for both professional liability and workers’ compensation, ProAssurance offers insureds, agents, and brokers unmatched ease in placing two difficult lines of business.
ProAssurance announces the formation of CAPAssurance in partnership with the Cooperative of American Physicians (CAP), a California-based insurer. CAPAssurance leverages CAP’s unmatched expertise to provide coverage for the unique needs of hospitals, medical facilities, and large physician groups in California and adjacent states.
2013
ProAssurance acquires Medmarc Insurance Group in a sponsored demutualization. The Medmarc Group, consisting of Medmarc Casualty Insurance Company and Noetic Specialty Insurance Company, expands ProAssurance’s healthcare-centric focus to medical products and life sciences, and lawyer writings.
2012
ProAssurance acquires Independent Nevada Doctors Insurance Exchange (IND), a Nevada reciprocal insurer. This vaults the company to a leadership position in the Nevada healthcare professional liability market and a strong base of operations in the far West.
ProAssurance enhances its commitment to delivering policyholders an exceptional experience by opening dedicated service centers in Birmingham, Alabama, and Okemos, Michigan, for seamless delivery of policyholder services.
2010
ProAssurance acquires American Physicians Service Group, Inc., the publically-traded parent company of American Physicians Insurance Company (API), an Austin, Texas-based insurer with roots stretching back to 1975. This transaction moves ProAssurance into the vital Texas market and expands writings in Arkansas and Oklahoma.
ProAssurance and Ascension Health, the nation’s largest not-for-profit healthcare provider, announce the creation of the Certitude™ program. This strategic partnership provides a competitive, financially secure medical professional liability program for certain on-staff and affiliated physicians and mid-level healthcare providers.
2009
ProAssurance acquires Podiatry Insurance Company of America, A Mutual Company (PICA) in a sponsored demutualization. PICA, founded by podiatrists in 1980, is the largest insurer of podiatrists in the U.S. PICA also is an insurer of U.S. chiropractors and acupuncturists through its subsidiary, PACO Assurance Company, Inc. (PACO). PICA had previously acquired PACO (1999), Dependable Protective Mutual (2000), and OUM (2001).
2008
ProAssurance acquires Mid-Continent General Underwriters (Now ProAssurance Mid-Continent Underwriters, Inc.)—cementing its ability to offer coverage to allied healthcare professionals, a growing segment of American healthcare delivery.
ProAssurance acquires Georgia Lawyers Insurance Company (GLIC), increasing its lawyers professional liability business—and naming new agencies to begin expanding its legal professional liability business in the Mid-Atlantic and far West regions.

2007
ProAssurance’s first year to be named as a member of the prestigious Ward’s 50®, an annual listing of the fifty top-performing property-casualty insurers in America. Award is based on service to policyholders, financial strength, and operating performance.

The Board elected former medical liability defense attorney, W. Stancil Starnes, to succeed Dr. Crowe as Chief Executive Officer effective July 1, 2007.

2005
ProAssurance acquires NCRIC Group, Inc. (NCRIC), a publically-traded parent company of NCRIC, Inc., an insurer serving Washington, DC and adjacent Mid-Atlantic states. NCRIC, formed by physicians in 1980, was converted to a public company in 1999.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    
System response time and account access times may vary due to a variety of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions, system performance, and other factors.
Time shown in Eastern Time unless otherwise specified.


The data contained herein from third party providers is obtained from what are considered reliable sources. However, it's accuracy, completeness, or reliability cannot be guaranteed. 


Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your
    investment strategy.

ProAssurance Corp. (PRA)HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0ProAssurance Corp. (PRA) Zacks Equity Research ZacksMay 11, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareProAssurance Corp.'s (PRA) first-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the back of an improved top line. Additionally, enhanced operating cash flow and asset position aided in driving the book value of shares. Higher operating cash flow is also likely to translate into enhanced operating leverage and generation of excess capital for share repurchases.Though the intense price and product competition, weak rate environment, loss cost trends and regulatory challenges limit the desired upside in the sector, we believe the benefits of geographic diversity, aggressive claims defense, stable ratings, improving ROE and strong financial position are likely to have a positive impact on the company over time.Our six-month target price of $108.00 per share equates to about 15.2x our earnings estimate for 2012. Combined with the $1.00 per share annual dividend, this target price implies an expected return of 21% over that period, which is consistent with our Outperform recommendation.PROASSURANCE CP (PRA): Free Stock Analysis Report Zacks Investment Research More From Zacks.com PROASSURANCE CP (PRA): Free Stock Analysis ReportReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityMarine’s Son Weeps in Stepmom’s Arms at Wedding: ‘He Could Feel All of the Emotions in the Room and All of the Love’7 reactions17%83%0%Drawing in the customers in Mogadishu11 reactions27%64%9%Ariel Winter went pantsless to show the world her new tattoo562 reactions5%71%24%Houston Stripper Maliah Michel Responds to Drake 'Retiring' Her Jersey215 reactions6%79%15%Two-time Pulitzer Prize winning photographer Muhammed Muheisen29 reactions2%83%15%Trump mocks Republicans for repeal and replace promise71 reactions5%69%26%Luis Fonsi On Justin Bieber's Spanish, 'Despacito' Hitting No. 1505 reactions3%80%17%Charlie Gard's family ends legal fight: 'We will miss him terribly'2,350 reactions6%66%28%Justin Bieber Cancels All Remaining 'Purpose' Tour Dates Due to 'Unforeseen Circumstances'987 reactions4%78%18%Judge clears way for Trump commission to collect voter data332 reactions4%73%23%Bodies found in overheated truck in a Walmart in Texas982 reactions4%75%21%Senate GOP gets new pressure from Trump on health care2 reactions100%0%0%Historic Pearl River Mart Reopens to Bring 'Cross-Cultural Joy' to NYC207 reactions8%68%24%Trump scolds Republicans for not ending the ‘Obamacare nightmare’990 reactions3%68%29%Yazidi girl held captive by Isis reveals she was raped every day for six months3,323 reactions5%62%33%Chart Watch: For the First Time Ever, an All-Hip-Hop Top Five70 reactions5%70%25%Kellyanne Conway explains what she meant by ‘alternative facts’Clifford Carraher: I couldn't bring myself to watch her explain what she meant by 'alternatives facts' with alternative facts.Join the Conversation1 / 54.7k

History[edit]
Growth and Acquisitions[edit]
On November 7, 2005, the company sold its personal lines insurance operations, known as Meemic Insurance Company, to Ally Financial (GMAC) for $400 million. Of the $400 million, $327 million was to be paid in cash, and $73 million was to be in capital that was held in Meemic Insurance Company.[4] The sale was completed on January 4, 2006.[5]
The company operates five principal subsidiaries: ProAssurance Indemnity Company (formerly The Medical Assurance Company), ProAssurance Casualty Company (formerly ProNational Insurance Company), ProAssurance Wisconsin Insurance Company (formerly PIC Wisconsin), ProAssurance Specialty Insurance Company (formerly Red Mountain Casualty Insurance Company), and ProAssurance National Capital Insurance Company (formerly NCRIC, Inc.).
On April 1, 2009, ProAssurance acquired Podiatry Insurance Company of America, A Mutual Company (PICA) in a sponsored demutualization. PICA, founded by podiatrists in 1980, is the largest insurer of podiatrists in the U.S. PICA also is an insurer of U.S. chiropractors and acupuncturists through its subsidiary, PACO Assurance Company, Inc. (PACO).PICA had previously acquired PACO (1999), Dependable Protective Mutual (2000), and OUM (2001).[6] PICA is domiciled in Illinois and its offices are in Brentwood, Tennessee.
In 2010, ProAssurance acquires American Physicians Service Group, Inc., the publically-traded parent company of American Physicians Insurance Company (API), an Austin, Texas-based insurer with roots stretching back to 1975. This transaction moves ProAssurance into the vital Texas market and expands writings in Arkansas and Oklahoma.[7] ProAssurance and Ascension Health, the nation's largest not-for-profit healthcare provider, announce the creation of the Certitude program. This strategic partnership provides a competitive, financially secure medical professional liability program for certain on-staff and affiliated physicians and mid-level healthcare providers.[8]
ProAssurance acquires Independent Nevada Doctors Insurance Exchange (IND)[9], a Nevada reciprocal insurer in 2012. This vaults the company to a leadership position in the Nevada healthcare professional liability market and a strong base of operations in the far West.
In 2013, ProAssurance acquires Medmarc Insurance Group[10] in a sponsored demutualization. The Medmarc Group, consisting of Medmarc Casualty Insurance Company and Noetic Specialty Insurance Company, expands ProAssurance's healthcare-centric focus to medical products and life sciences, and lawyer writings.
On January 1, 2014 ProAssurance acquires Eastern Insurance Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded healthcare-centric writer of worker's compensation insurance. [11] ProAssurance becomes the majority capital provider to Syndicate 1729 at Lloyd's of London.[12] Also, in 2014 ProAssurance announces the formation of CAPAssurance in partnership with the Cooperative of American Physicians (CAP), a California-based insurer.[13]
In 2015, ProAssurance forms ProAssurance American Mutual, A Risk Retention Group domiciled in Washington, D.C. The Risk Retention Group provides ProAssurance with additional flexibility to service its customers with challenging and complex needs.
In 2017, ProAssurance's subsidiary, Eastern Alliance, purchased Great Falls Insurance Company's book of workers' compensation business. This purchase allowed Eastern to expand operations into Maine and New Hampshire.[14]

History[edit]
Growth and Acquisitions[edit]
On November 7, 2005, the company sold its personal lines insurance operations, known as Meemic Insurance Company, to Ally Financial (GMAC) for $400 million. Of the $400 million, $327 million was to be paid in cash, and $73 million was to be in capital that was held in Meemic Insurance Company.[4] The sale was completed on January 4, 2006.[5]
The company operates five principal subsidiaries: ProAssurance Indemnity Company (formerly The Medical Assurance Company), ProAssurance Casualty Company (formerly ProNational Insurance Company), ProAssurance Wisconsin Insurance Company (formerly PIC Wisconsin), ProAssurance Specialty Insurance Company (formerly Red Mountain Casualty Insurance Company), and ProAssurance National Capital Insurance Company (formerly NCRIC, Inc.).
On April 1, 2009, ProAssurance acquired Podiatry Insurance Company of America, A Mutual Company (PICA) in a sponsored demutualization. PICA, founded by podiatrists in 1980, is the largest insurer of podiatrists in the U.S. PICA also is an insurer of U.S. chiropractors and acupuncturists through its subsidiary, PACO Assurance Company, Inc. (PACO).PICA had previously acquired PACO (1999), Dependable Protective Mutual (2000), and OUM (2001).[6] PICA is domiciled in Illinois and its offices are in Brentwood, Tennessee.
In 2010, ProAssurance acquires American Physicians Service Group, Inc., the publically-traded parent company of American Physicians Insurance Company (API), an Austin, Texas-based insurer with roots stretching back to 1975. This transaction moves ProAssurance into the vital Texas market and expands writings in Arkansas and Oklahoma.[7] ProAssurance and Ascension Health, the nation's largest not-for-profit healthcare provider, announce the creation of the Certitude program. This strategic partnership provides a competitive, financially secure medical professional liability program for certain on-staff and affiliated physicians and mid-level healthcare providers.[8]
ProAssurance acquires Independent Nevada Doctors Insurance Exchange (IND)[9], a Nevada reciprocal insurer in 2012. This vaults the company to a leadership position in the Nevada healthcare professional liability market and a strong base of operations in the far West.
In 2013, ProAssurance acquires Medmarc Insurance Group[10] in a sponsored demutualization. The Medmarc Group, consisting of Medmarc Casualty Insurance Company and Noetic Specialty Insurance Company, expands ProAssurance's healthcare-centric focus to medical products and life sciences, and lawyer writings.
On January 1, 2014 ProAssurance acquires Eastern Insurance Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded healthcare-centric writer of worker's compensation insurance. [11] ProAssurance becomes the majority capital provider to Syndicate 1729 at Lloyd's of London.[12] Also, in 2014 ProAssurance announces the formation of CAPAssurance in partnership with the Cooperative of American Physicians (CAP), a California-based insurer.[13]
In 2015, ProAssurance forms ProAssurance American Mutual, A Risk Retention Group domiciled in Washington, D.C. The Risk Retention Group provides ProAssurance with additional flexibility to service its customers with challenging and complex needs.
In 2017, ProAssurance's subsidiary, Eastern Alliance, purchased Great Falls Insurance Company's book of workers' compensation business. This purchase allowed Eastern to expand operations into Maine and New Hampshire.[14]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
