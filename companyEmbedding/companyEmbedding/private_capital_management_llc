We believe successful investing, especially during times of economic and political uncertainty, is as much about managing risk as it is returns. Our objective, utilizing our proprietary quantitative research process is to find investments that offer good returns on a risk adjusted basis. Several of the elements in our ranking system include statistical measures of risk, volatility, and excess risk adjusted returns as well as bear market performance and technical profile, allowing for the screening and tracking of a large number of investments. In addition, we also perform qualitative analysis on each of our investments. We remain committed to the continuous exercise of discipline and in-depth research and we will use our quantitative research to assist in making the right investment decisions for you.
