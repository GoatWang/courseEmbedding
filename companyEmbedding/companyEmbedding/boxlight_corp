Cooperative Learning Solutions For The Classroom

Collaborative Learning
Collaboration is quickly becoming the new norm in schools, to help students develop and demonstrate critical thinking and teamwork skills. Studies show that collaborative learning teams develop higher-level thinking and retain information longer than students working individually. That is especially true when collaborative learning follows new concepts taught in whole-class instruction. Collaborative and cooperative learning brings a deeper understanding of content, increased overall achievement, higher motivation, improved confidence, and teamwork skills.
Boxlight collaborative solutions help facilitate group learning through interactive displays, tables, boards, and student devices. We provide varied tools to fit your students’ learning styles, helping to teach the collaboration skills so important for success in today’s classroom and beyond.









MimioMobile application


Our classroom software and app facilitate collaboration and help students build their knowledge across all curricular areas. Whether it’s two students working together or many more, collaboration helps students develop communication and critical thinking skills. These skills are essential for their future success, and align to applicable standards.

Teachers can show any combination of the students’ work on the front-of-the-class display, creating a greater collaborative and cooperative learning and providing more in-depth understanding of the students’ comprehension.
The MimioMobile app is compatible with Apple and Android phones and tablets, as well as any device with a supported Web browser– including Chromebooks, Windows and Mac laptops, Windows Surface tablets, and more.
The MimioMobile app connects in just seconds to the teacher’s MimioStudio software – no need to remember IP addresses or complicated logins.
Purchase just one annual license for the teacher and download the app to every student mobile device in the classroom.

“With MimioMobile, differentiated instruction has never been easier! As a classroom teacher, I can create a lesson in MimioStudio for various ability levels. My students then collaborate in small groups using their mobile devices to engage in active learning.”
Paul Gigliotti, History Teacher














MimioPad wireless pen tablet


 

“We love using MimioPad. It allows us to move around the room and monitor students during Mimio lessons without approaching the whiteboard and getting in the visual field of students.”
Michelle Robau, Teacher, Collier County Public Schools


Teachers rejoice! With the MimioPad™ wireless pen tablet you can move freely around the classroom and control your interactive whiteboard from anywhere in the room. Multiple student’s work can be simultaneously viewed on the front of the room display. It’s collaborative learning, from the front row to last.

Assessment Tools To Facilitate Differentiated Instruction

Assessment for Learning
What are students learning? And how should you differentiate instruction to make sure they are gaining the essential skills? Assessment is a key piece of the learning cycle. It helps to benchmark student comprehension of critical skills and their knowledge base. With assessment we can better recognize which students need more whole-class learning, more team and small-group work, or more one-to-one focus.
Boxlight assessment tools enable all types of knowledge check-ins, from real-time formative assessment to summative assessment — allowing you to gauge learning and review the goals that have been set for students.









MimioMobile application


Differentiated instruction is one of the keys to student achievement. But in order to personalize learning, teachers need to perform real-time formative assessment. Teachers can do just that with your school’s mobile devices equipped with the MimioMobile™ app, or any device using a compatible Web browser. They can adjust their lessons accordingly, and use the data to direct small-group or individualized instruction to increase the effectiveness of the lesson.

The MimioMobile app connects in just seconds to the teacher’s MimioStudio™ software – no need to remember IP addresses or complicated logins.
Purchase just one annual license for the teacher and download the app to every student mobile device in the classroom.
Teachers can create assessments with short-answer, short-essay, numeric, and multiple-choice student responses, which will help to prepare students for Common Core State Standards Assessments.
Students may use any combination of MimioVote™ handsets and devices running the MimioMobile app.

“ MimioMobile allows students to actively participate from anywhere in the classroom. They can even answer assessment questions with their devices.”
Paul Gigliotti, History Teacher














MimioVote assessment system


 

“…really has allowed us to do real-time formative assessment with students.”
Michael Bednarz Director of Curriculum Stafford Springs, CT
Learn more


With the MimioVote™ assessment, the results are immediate and the feedback has value. Teachers know who is learning and who needs help. And when students don’t have to think about how to use the device, they can concentrate on answering the questions.

The intuitive design provides instantaneous teacher-led or self-paced evaluation, without the hassle typically found with ordinary assessment tools. Teachers get accurate, real-time results and eliminate the extra workload of manual test correction. And they can download results into spreadsheets and lesson plans to easily track learning.
Quick-poll during a lesson, to see who’s getting it and who needs some help.
Reduces student confusion by illuminating only the answer buttons needed for each test.
Easily import standard tests and publisher’s content.
Compatible with MimioStudio templates and Microsoft PowerPoint.
Automatic recharging means tech directors don’t have the hassle of battery replacement

Our Mission
Boxlight’s mission is to be the leader of innovative and effective educational technology solutions. We aim to improve learning and engagement in classrooms, and to help educators enhance student outcomes and build essential skills, by developing the products they need.
We back up this ability with trusted relationships, knowledgeable and dedicated employees, unsurpassed customer service, and the most comprehensive selection of quality products.
We strive to be a trusted partner to our customers and vendors and to earn a fair profit while embracing ethical business practices.
Better Solutions. Better Results.







About Us
Founded in 1985, Boxlight, a US owned and operated company, quickly became a leader in presentation technology, climbing Inc. 500 lists and becoming synonymous with projection and display solutions for business, government, and education. After taking over Boxlight’s US and worldwide operations in 2009, Hank and Sunshine Nance focused the company on the education industry.
Mimio was founded in 1997 by way of five creative-thinking students at MIT. They saw that students were so busy taking notes, they weren’t able to pay attention to the actual class. They believed there had to be a better way. By combining innovation with their passion for education, they created their flagship product, the ink capture system. Their passion for creating leading-edge technologies that fuel learning has been integral to their mission from day one.











In 2016, Boxlight acquired Mimio. Together they are a leading global provider of technology in the classroom. The partnership enables Boxlight to bring to today’s education market powerful, integrated solutions that are unmatched. But even more inspiring is where their combined passion for learning will take educational technology, classroom educators, and students in the years ahead.





“The merger brings a comprehensive lineup of award-winning, proven educational solutions that meet the instructional needs of K-12 districts, schools, and students,” notes Mark Elliott, CEO of Boxlight Corporation. “It allows Boxlight to take another step forward in its journey to partner with schools to create the dynamic classrooms that are needed to educate students today and tomorrow.”

Boxlight unveiled the ProColor Series 1 interactive flat panel displays.

The New ProColor Interactive Flat Panels: Available in a range of sizes – HD 55” 65”, 70”, and 65”, 75”, and 84” UHD 4K models; up to ten single-point touch users or five dual-touch and gestures users that work simultaneously with Touch 360° interactivity, driving collaborative learning; access to a wealth of applications in Google Classroom via Android OS built-in browser; built-in stereo speakers, eliminating the need for a separate audio system; and LED backlighting, which provides long-term reliability and contributes to low energy consumption.


Boxlight to Debut Extensive Line of Standard and Interactive Laser and Bulb Projectors at ISTE 2016
Jun 15 16
Boxlight will be unveiling its new line of P12 projectors at the 2016 ISTE Conference & Expo in Denver, Colorado. Scheduled to start shipping in late June, the product line offers educators four easy ways to bring stunning visuals to classroom instruction. In addition to a standard projector, the line includes laser, laser HD, and laser ultra-wide projectors. The P12L ultra-short-throw laser projector, the P12LU laser ultra-wide projector and the P12B ultra-short-throw projector. The P12B ultra-short-throw displays interactive images as large as 110 inches, the P12L touch projector shows interactive images as large as 115 inches, and the P12LU creates interactive images as large as 140 inches. In addition, the P12L and P12LU projectors' laser illumination saves time and resources - there are no lamps to fail, and no lamps to change. And the projectors' 20-year laser life span reduces maintenance worries. All P12 interactive projectors are full-featured hardware and software solutions that include MimioStudio classroom software and three MimioMobile connections. When the projectors are used with the software and a MimioMobile classroom version, teachers can perform collaboration and assessment activities at the front of the room or on almost any student device. Additionally, the projectors' analog and digital audio/video connections ensure compatibility with virtually any PC, and users can employ them with Mac, Windows or Linux OS.

Boxlight Corp., a Lawrenceville, Ga.-based education technology provider, has filed to go public.
Boxlight, which claims to have developed the first interactive projector in the world, plans to raise up to $23 million in an IPO, the company said in a Securities & Exchange filing. Boxlight will issue up to 2,090,909 shares, priced at $11 per share, according to an S-1 filing.

Launched in 2001, Boxlight designs and makes 70” HD and 84” 4k interactive LED flat panels. The company, which relocated its headquarters from Belfair, Wash., also sells display devices, audio solutions, and mobile carts and stands to the education and learning technology markets.




In its S-1 filing, Boxlight announced plans to acquire three companies — Taiwan-based Everest Display Inc., Israeli-based Globisens Ltd and Georgia-based Gensis Collaboration LLC.
"Through the acquisitions of (Everest) and Globisens, we seek to become a single source, world-leading innovator, manufacturer and integrator of interactive products for schools and universities, as well as for the instruction and professional development markets for business and governmental agencies,” Boxlight said in the filing. "In addition, we intend to further develop our technology by incorporating existing classroom management tools and software to establish a platform that will enable our clients to interact with each other to share presentations, lesson plans and other interactive learning techniques.”
In 2014, Boxlight reported a loss of$1,036,000 on $24,898,000 in revenue. The company has research and development and manufacturing centers in Hchinshu, Taiwan and Wuxi, China. Boxlight also contract manufactures interactive projectors and components to brand name equipment suppliers.
