        NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas, March 9, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Baron Energy, Inc. (Pink Sheets:BROE) ("Baron" or the "Company"), an independent oil and gas company, announced today that its production enhancement program is now complete. Production has been increased by approximately 80% since the beginning of the year.
    
Management Comments

	Ronnie L. Steinocher, President and CEO, said, "This wraps up Phase-3 of our production enhancement program that we started in December last year. Severe winter weather conditions in January and February caused substantial delays in our field work but we were finally able to complete the program with excellent results."

	"In December we divested of some of our non-operated properties as we continue to move the Company to operated only properties. This production enhancement program has now replaced most of the production sold," Steinocher added.
About Baron Energy, Inc.

	Baron Energy, Inc. (Pink Sheets:BROE) is an independent oil and gas production, exploitation, and exploration company headquartered in New Braunfels, Texas with producing assets in the prolific oil producing Permian Basin of West Texas.

	Baron owns production that is 100% oil, both operated and non-operated, with working interest ranging from 12.5% to 100% in oil fields located in Baylor, Jones, Runnels, Scurry, and Taylor Counties, Texas.
