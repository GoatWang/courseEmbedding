			Stephens Funds®
		Stephens Investment Management Group, LLC (“SIMG") launched the Stephens Small Cap Growth Fund in December 2005 and the Stephens Mid Cap Growth Fund in June 2006, each a series of the Professionally Managed Portfolios Trust through U.S. Bancorp.
		In launching our own fund family, SIMG was not looking to be all things to all people.  We were very fortunate to build a small, successful fund family from the ground up.  As a relatively small, boutique firm, we have had the unique opportunity to know the majority of our mutual fund investors.  We are very grateful to those Shareholders, Advisors, Consultants and Institutions that gave us an opportunity early on in our first few years.
		Effective February 24, 2012, the Stephens Small Cap Growth Fund and Stephens Mid Cap Growth Fund were reorganized into the American Beacon Family of Funds. The new Funds were renamed as the American Beacon Stephens Small Cap Growth Fund and the American Beacon Stephens Mid-Cap Growth Fund.  SIMG continues to manage the day-to-day portfolio as the sub-adviser to the American Beacon Stephens Funds. By engaging SIMG as a sub-adviser, American Beacon Advisers was able to provide shareholders continuity of the portfolio management team that has been responsible for the Stephens Funds' performance records since the inception of each of the Funds.
		For more information on the Funds, please visit American Beacon's website at www.americanbeaconfunds.com.
		We appreciate your interest in the investment products managed by Stephens Investment Management Group, LLC.

Treehouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS) Upgraded to “Hold” by Zacks Investment Research


					Posted by Harper Lund on Jul 17th, 2017 // No Comments




Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of Treehouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research note published on Tuesday, July 4th. 
According to Zacks, “Shares of TreeHouse Foods have outperformed the industry since the past one month. The company has been proactive towards consumer’s interests in natural and fresh foods and thus has been increasingly focusing on organic food production. Moreover, the company has witnessed positive comparable store sales growth trends in food-away-from-home outlets, which mainly focuses on clean ingredients and labels. Nevertheless, changing customer buying patterns along with currency headwinds poses as concerns for the company. Acquisition, investments in sales force and higher incentive compensation have also led to increasing the operating costs of the company. Also, the company issued a soft guidance for the second quarter, which is below expectations. Nevertheless, management remains impressed with the progress of the Private Brands’ integration and revised organizational structure.”

Consensus Ratings for NN (NASDAQ:NNBR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $33.50 (16.32% upside)
