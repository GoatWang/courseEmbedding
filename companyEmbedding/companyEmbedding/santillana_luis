Buena idea, mal ejecutada


            El app y el proceso de registro es un total desastre. El proceso de registro de licencia al igual que el descargar un libro es una mezcla de pasos que no tienen sentido alguno. Sugiero que contraten a una especialista en usabilidad y simplifiquen el proceso y el app. Aparte no hay versión para iOS y la versión de Android requiere una tableta de 10 pulgadas. Por estas y otras cosas es una buena idea, pero mal ejecutada.
