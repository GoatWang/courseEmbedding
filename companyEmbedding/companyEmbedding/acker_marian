When I opened them they were ...blatantly  stale and the ginger and macadamia rusks smelt of old rancid nut. I have been trying to figure out who I  should be complaining to.  The person who makes the rusks and distributes them to the various stores should put the date they were made on the label as well as a suggested sell by date. If this was done, I  would have complained to the store for selling  food with an expired date on it. Unfortunately,  the labels had no indication of the date were made nor the date they should be sold by, hense my complaint is at your door. I paid R66.99 and R57.99 for the 2 packets. This is a lot to pay for the small packets and as such I  really expect fresh and tasty.  Please advice me on what to do about this situation.

You can use any topping you like, but it is really yummy with fresh berries or passion fruit.  For a dairy free version you can use coconut milk. Heat 1/3 cup milk and dissolve 15 ml gelatine, whisking well with fork of whisk (don’t let it boil!).... Heat 2 ½ cups cream with 125ml sugar until sugar is dissolved. Add the two mixtures together and poor into ramekins.  Let it set in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before you put the berries on top.

This is the edition with the washerwoman carrying a bag of laundry on her head beside an ornate iron gate, on the front cover and repeated on the front of the dust jacket. The book has only quite minor edgewear and acid-paper staining on the fep along with the previous owner's gift inscription; the crinkle on the inside of the back cover and the endpaper is mentioned by those who own other copies of the book--it is probably a minor production defect. Otherwise, the book is in very good condition. The dust jacket has edgewear and has been split at the fold between spine and front cover, repaired internally with archival tape and the whole protected by a plastic cover. The etching on the front panel is fine. Serious inquirers may request photos. Language: eng.  Bookseller Inventory # 12861

Our carrying broker provides the execution for all other Canadian and US exchanges, clearance and settlement of securities transactions, the maintenance of and access to client accounts, and the delivery of funds and securities.
In the event of an internal or external SBD, we would be able to continue order execution through IRESS or Triton. We would maintain a connection to ISM to transmit to our carrying broker via the internet.  We would back up and recover the QSA system at our alternate location.  The recovery of the trading systems and QSA will occur on designated laptop computers.  The laptops are pre-loaded with all the back-up programs necessary to conduct trading and back-up.

In addition, we will be able to access our client database program, Maximizer, once the data recovery process has taken place.  The program is pre-loaded on to a laptop computer maintained at the alternate site.
External Dependencies - Service Providers
We have contacted our critical service providers (businesses with which we have an ongoing commercial relationship in support of our operating activities, such as vendors providing us critical services), and determined the extent to which we can continue our business relationship with them in light of the internal or external SBD. We will quickly establish alternative arrangements if a business constituent can no longer provide the needed goods or services when we need them because of a SBD to them or our firm.
Regulatory Reporting
Acker Finley is subject to regulation by: IIROC, OSC, TSX and CNSX. We now file reports using the internet, email, paper copies in the mail, fax, and Echoworx Encrypted email. In the event of an SBD, we will check with our regulators to determine which means of filing are still available to us, and use the means closest in speed and form (written or oral) to our previous filing method. At our alternate location, we will have a laptop computer pre-loaded with the Quickbooks program.  In the event that we cannot contact our regulators, we will continue to file required reports using the communication means available to us.
Updates and Annual Review
Acker Finley will update this plan whenever we have a material change to our operations, structure, business or location or to those of our carrying broker. In addition, our firm will review this BCP annually, on July 31st, to modify it for any changes in our operations, structure, business, or location or those of our carrying broker.

Wide-ranging expertiseFlexibility makes the differenceAs a solution partner, Acker faces up to a host of different challenges, be it adaptation of the structure of a warp-knitted fabric or a completely new, complex solution. In cooperation with our clients or completely autonomously, our team devises suitable solutions quickly and reliably.In the process, our clients benefit from the wide-ranging options offered by our machinery, but also from the high levels of training and professional qualification of our employees. The machines installed at our plant in Seligenstadt enable us to do everything from yarn preparation through warp-knitting and dyeing to a wide spectrum of innovative finishing techniques, all “under a single factory roof”.Ahead of our time
Acker’s innovative technical solutions already fulfil the requirements of tomorrow, resulting in customer-oriented solutions for a product base that can be adapted to different customer demands promptly and with a minimum of effort. At the same time, visual surface effects, technical properties and environmental compatibility are all criteria of equal importance both in the construction and in the launch of new Acker products.“Well warped is half knitted”
Warping is the first step of the production process at Acker. With great precision, a multitude of threads – what's called the “yarn sheet” – are spooled onto section warp beams that are then loaded into the warp-knitting machines of the subsequent process. Uniform preparation of the material is absolutely essential if the warp-knitted fabric is to be of outstanding quality. This is why all threads of the yarn are subjected to an intensive incoming inspection. We work with modern, computerised warping machines with a capacity of 120 t/month.
Custom warp-knitting to fulfil every customer's wish
We manufacture high-quality textiles for example velour made from polyester, polyamide and special-purpose yarns. To this end, we have more than 50 units capable of providing our customers with a variety of warp-knitting processes. In order to keep constant checks on the quality of the product, the high-performance machines are equipped with laser-assisted 100% control. Thanks to our pool of state-of-the-art warp-knitting machines, we are able to respond to any wish our customers may have. Together with our experienced employees, we work on new structures of warp-knitted fabrics or adapt existing basic patterns to new requirements.
