I have been seeing her for 3 years and it still amazes me how skilled she is at placing needles and resolving physical problems.  I had shoulder pain for many years that no chiropractor was able to resolve in spite of many treatments.  She was able to take care of this pain using a combination of acupuncture and cupping.  I have had no problemssince.  She has also helped me with other problems such as persistent colds and irritable bowel.  I highly recommend her services in acupuncture.
