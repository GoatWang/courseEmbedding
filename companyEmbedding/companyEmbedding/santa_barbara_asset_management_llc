The Case for Diversification across the Dividend Yield Spectrum
Focusing on the highest dividend yielders may not always result in the highest return.








Data source: FactSet Alpha Testing, 1/1/07-3/31/17. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not protect against loss. Non-dividend payers are  those companies in the S&P 500 Index that have a yield of 0.0%.

Dividends are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.  Dividend yield is one component of performance and should not be the only consideration for investment.

Risks and Other Important Considerations
This information should not be relied upon as investment advice, recommendations, offers or solicitation of any particular security, asset class, fund, strategy, or investment product. Investing entails risk, including the possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that any investment or asset class will provide positive performance over any period of time. Dividend yield is one component of performance and should not be the only consideration for investment. Dividends are not guaranteed and will fluctuate. Equity investments such as large-cap stocks are subject to market risk or the risk of decline in response to adverse company news, industry developments, or a general economic decline. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies are subject to greater volatility. Non-U.S. investing presents additional risks such as the potential for adverse political, currency, economic, social or regulatory developments in a country including lack of liquidity, excessive taxation, and differing legal and accounting standards. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

Business Continuity Plan Summary
As a participant in Nuveen’s enterprise-wide Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan (“the Plan”), Santa Barbara Asset Management, LLC (“Santa Barbara”) maintains comprehensive procedures reflecting the Firm’s commitment to plan for and to be prepared for significant business disruptions. The Plan addresses significant disruptions to the Firm’s business operations conducted at its Los Angeles location, where nearly all of Santa Barbara’s mission critical processes are conducted.  Additionally, the Plan addresses significant interruptions affecting the Firm’s primary production systems which are located in the Chicago area.
The Plan has been designed to cover all critical business processes that are essential for the Firm to continue conducting business during a temporary business interruption.  The most important aspects of the Firm’s investment advisory business are addressed in the Plan, including continued management and trading of client portfolios, ongoing operational and legal/compliance support, protecting books and records, and maintaining communication with employees, clients, service providers, and regulators.
The Firm’s primary business recovery strategy is to resume its critical business processes and/or provide access to key critical systems/applications from remote locations, with minimal interruption, as soon as possible, depending on the nature of the disruption.  As such, the steps taken, pursuant to the Plan, are designed to ensure that critical information is captured on a daily basis in a manner that can be accessed by employees from remote or alternate locations.  Additionally, the Firm has contacted its critical business partners, such as vendors providing essential systems/applications and/or other services and has evaluated their capabilities to provide services in the event of various disruption scenarios.  The Firm has additionally considered alternative providers that could be utilized if necessary.  Furthermore, the Firm’s information technology operations form a critical part of the Firm’s business and each of its critical business processes. The Plan includes a detailed information technology component which identifies the functions, operations, and resources necessary to support the restoration and resumption of all critical business processes performed at the Firm’s Los Angeles location and to facilitate access to critical systems/applications housed at third-party service providers via an array of communications connectivity. An alternate facility outside of California also serves as a back-up facility supporting resumption of critical in-house systems/applications.
In conclusion, the Plan addresses the steps the Firm will take to address a temporary business disruption in a systematic and organized fashion. However, since the effects of a disaster are difficult to predict and the disruption of systems and processes on an industry-wide basis will pose great challenges for any business continuity plan, there can be no assurance that any plan can address such unforeseen contingencies.
Effective: March 1, 2013

Risks and Other Important Considerations
This information should not be relied upon as investment advice, recommendations, offers or solicitation of any particular security, asset class, fund, strategy, or investment product. Investing entails risk, including the possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that any investment or asset class will provide positive performance over any period of time. Dividend yield is one component of performance and should not be the only consideration for investment. Dividends are not guaranteed and will fluctuate. Equity investments such as large-cap stocks are subject to market risk or the risk of decline in response to adverse company news, industry developments, or a general economic decline. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies are subject to greater volatility. Non-U.S. investing presents additional risks such as the potential for adverse political, currency, economic, social or regulatory developments in a country including lack of liquidity, excessive taxation, and differing legal and accounting standards. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
The statements contained herein reflect the opinions of Santa Barbara Asset Management, LLC (“Santa Barbara”) as of the date written. Certain statements are forward looking and/or based on current expectations, projections, and information currently available to Santa Barbara. Such statements may or may not be accurate over the long-term. While we believe we have a reasonable basis for our comments and we have confidence in our opinions, actual results may differ from those we anticipate. We cannot assure future results and disclaim any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Statistical data was taken from sources which we deem to be reliable, but their accuracy cannot be guaranteed.

Risks and Other Important Considerations
This information should not be relied upon as investment advice, recommendations, offers or solicitation of any particular security, asset class, fund, strategy, or investment product. Investing entails risk, including the possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that any investment or asset class will provide positive performance over any period of time. Dividend yield is one component of performance and should not be the only consideration for investment. Dividends are not guaranteed and will fluctuate. Equity investments such as large-cap stocks are subject to market risk or the risk of decline in response to adverse company news, industry developments, or a general economic decline. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies are subject to greater volatility. Non-U.S. investing presents additional risks such as the potential for adverse political, currency, economic, social or regulatory developments in a country including lack of liquidity, excessive taxation, and differing legal and accounting standards. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
The statements contained herein reflect the opinions of Santa Barbara Asset Management, LLC (“Santa Barbara”) as of the date written. Certain statements are forward looking and/or based on current expectations, projections, and information currently available to Santa Barbara. Such statements may or may not be accurate over the long-term. While we believe we have a reasonable basis for our comments and we have confidence in our opinions, actual results may differ from those we anticipate. We cannot assure future results and disclaim any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Statistical data was taken from sources which we deem to be reliable, but their accuracy cannot be guaranteed.
Santa Barbara Asset Management, LLC is a registered investment adviser and an affiliate of Nuveen, LLC.

							A Word On Risk

							Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. There is no guarantee the Fund’s investment objectives will be achieved. Dividends are not guaranteed. Prices of equity securities may decline significantly over short or extended periods of time. Non-U.S. investments involve risks such as currency fluctuation, political and economic instability, lack of liquidity and differing legal and accounting standards. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. These and other risk considerations, such as currency, growth stock, preferred security, and smaller company risks, are described in detail in the Fund’s prospectus.

The Case for Diversification across the Dividend Yield Spectrum
Focusing on the highest dividend yielders may not always result in the highest return.








Data source: FactSet Alpha Testing, 1/1/07-3/31/17. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not protect against loss. Non-dividend payers are  those companies in the S&P 500 Index that have a yield of 0.0%.
This material is not intended to be a recommendation or investment advice, does not constitute a solicitation to buy or sell securities, and is not provided in a fiduciary capacity. The information provided does not take into account the specific objectives or circumstances of any particular investor, or suggest any specific course of action. Investment decisions should be made based on an investor's objectives and circumstances and in consultation with his or her advisors.  This material is for informational and educational purposes only and is not intended to predict or depict performance of any investment.  All investments carry a certain degree of risk, including possible loss of principal, and there is no assurance that an investment will provide positive performance over any period of time.  Different indices and economic periods will produce different results. Indices are unmanaged and unavailable for direct investment. Equity investments are subject to market risk or the risk that stocks will decline in response to such factors as adverse company news or industry developments or a general economic decline.  Dividends are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.  Dividend yield is one component of performance and should not be the only consideration for investment.

Data source: CBOE Volatility Index data, 1/1/86-3/31/17. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The CBOE (Chicago Board of Exchange) Volatility Index® (VIX®) is a key measure of market expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option prices. All indices are unmanaged and unavailable for direct investment.







An Economic Perspective on Dividends
An actively managed portfolio of high-quality companies with the fundamentals for sustainable dividend growth has the potential for higher long-term total return with lower risk.

Risks and Other Important Considerations
This information should not be relied upon as investment advice, recommendations, offers or solicitation of any particular security, asset class, fund, strategy, or investment product. Investing entails risk, including the possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that any investment or asset class will provide positive performance over any period of time. Dividend yield is one component of performance and should not be the only consideration for investment. Dividends are not guaranteed and will fluctuate. Equity investments such as large-cap stocks are subject to market risk or the risk of decline in response to adverse company news, industry developments, or a general economic decline. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies are subject to greater volatility. Non-U.S. investing presents additional risks such as the potential for adverse political, currency, economic, social or regulatory developments in a country including lack of liquidity, excessive taxation, and differing legal and accounting standards. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

Certain statements are forward looking and/or based on current expectations, projections, and information currently available to Santa Barbara. Such statements may or may not be accurate over the long-term. While we believe we have a reasonable basis for our comments and we have confidence in our opinions, actual results may differ from those we anticipate. We cannot assure future results and disclaim any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
