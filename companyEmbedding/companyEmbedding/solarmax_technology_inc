Solar Rebates
from Your Utility Company





In addition to the Federal Solar Tax Credit, many utility companies offer incentives in the form rebates.
Rebates are typically issued once installation of your new photovoltaic solar energy system is complete. The rebate amount is usually based on the calculated energy production of your solar energy system. We will help you to identify and apply for all applicable rebates.

                                    Great job by a group of friendly, professional folks. Our solar panels are working great and you can’t even see them from the street. Can’t wait to get that first tinier electricity bill!                                    

- -Benjamin M.






                                    "My sales rep was very informative and professional. After going through about 8 different meetings and proposals with other vendors, Solarmax just made sense. It was the best choice for me balancing cost, support, & ROI."                                    

- 






                                    We highly recommend using Solar Max Technology for any and project dealing with solar panels, whether you are having them install new paenls or even panels another company put in. Their technicians know the business cold and they could not have been friendlier and more efficient!

                                    Purchased my Solar Panel system from Solarmax in April 2014. From my initial contact with the sales team to the final installation and inspection of my system the experience has been professional, competent, and highly satisfactory. I love how my system works, the savings in our o

Why Solar
If money fell from the sky, would you catch it? Energy is money, and it’s falling from the sky in the form of sunlight.
Harvesting that power is a smart and responsible investment.






Save Money, Every Month
If your bill is over $100 SolarMax can immediately reduce your monthly energy cost. With manufacturing, financing, and installation done in­-house, you get the maximum savings advantage.






Energy and Equity
Not only will you save on monthly utility bills, the value of your home
will increase because with SolarMax you own your energy.






Big Impact, Small Footprint
The average residential solar panel system reduces CO2 emissions equivalent
to taking a sedan completely off the road each year.






Freedom From the Electric Company
In California, energy rates have increased an average of 6.5% EACH year.
With SolarMax, you’ll lock in low rates saving thousands off your energy bills for decades.





Our Services
Let us help you make the best decision about solar energy based on your home’s characteristics and your energy needs.
Your home and goals are unique to you. We understand that, so every SolarMax system is perfectly customized
after a detailed consultation. You get exactly what is best for you ­ all the features you want, without paying
for anything you don’t want or need.
We make it smooth and effortless.

Company






Welcome to SolarMax LED, now a family member of SolarMax Technology, Inc. The origins of SolarMax LED date back to 1999 with the formation of ACT One Communications, Inc., one of the early-stage innovators in LED technology and applications.  ACT One Communications, Inc., which specialized in signage and outdoor lighting systems for government and commercial markets, grew to become one of the leading providers in North and Latin America before its acquistion by SolarMax Technology, Inc. in 2013. SolarMax subsequently moved the newly acquired company to Riverside with offices in Diamond Bar and re-branded it as SolarMax LED. The strategic acquisition represented an ideal complement to the parent company’s rooftop solar business, adding energy conservation to its diversified renewable portfolio.  Since then, SolarMax LED has grown to become the preferred provider of energy-efficient lighting systems throughout California, securing millions of dollars in new contracts to install energy-efficient street light systems for public facilities and commercial businesses.With the Federal government’s pledge to reduce energy consumption nationwide by 60% - including the replacement of some 500,000 street light poles - SolarMax LED is strategically positioned to continue its growth across both the public and private sector. About SolarMax LED Inc. At SolarMax LED, we believe in a very fundamental principle: simple is better than complex.   Nowhere is that more important than when it comes to converting energy-wasting, costly lighting systems with today’s state-of-the-art LED lighting solutions. The problem, of course, is that there’s a lot of involved beyond simply changing a light bulb.  You need experts that not only understand their business, but more importantly, know yours.  SolarMax LED specialists do.  They work with you to deliver end-to-end lighting solutions and support tailored to your unique operational requirements. SolarMax LED provides:          Free comprehensive energy audits - even for large commercial installations         Over 14 different product lines and more than 100 models      Competitive Product Warranty         1-Year Labor warranty     CalTrans Approved Vendor        Pre-qualified for public utility company applications Compelling as our features are, it’s what SolarMax LED lighting design specialists do once they’re on-site that makes our customer service shine brighter.  Our specialists look at every aspect of your current lighting system to identify areas of inefficiency and where you can increase performance providing a great customer service experience. Are you re-designing the infrastructure of your current system to achieve more optimal lighting angles perhaps it’s a new form factor for the light itself, or re-wiring your circuits?Whatever the case, SolarMax LED designers and technical experts will light the way to a future with lower utility bills and energy savings.   Phone(909) 595-6818Fax: (909) 595-7388Location3080 12th St.Riverside, CA 92507
