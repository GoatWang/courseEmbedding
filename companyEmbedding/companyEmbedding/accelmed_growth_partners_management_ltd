Merging Med-Tech innovation with global commercial platforms 
 
Accelmed is an investment firm focused on value creation for medical device companies and technologies. Accelmed was founded in 2009 by Mori Arkin and Uri Geiger and invests in small and mid-cap private and public companies.
With its proven track record and large team of accomplished investment professionals, Accelmed’s vision is to create leading med-tech players by merging commercial platforms with small innovative growth companies, predominantly from Israel.
 
 
 
 
 



 

 










         
    
 
 







 
Integrating commercial platforms with innovation and providing growth equity to foster significant value creation
 
Accelmed brings its acumen in medical devices and its dominant presence in Israel to the Platform Model, which has already been implemented with great success.
Under the Platform model, Accelmed integrates innovative and market-ready medical device technologies into existing commercial companies that are able to effectively distribute and commercialize the new products.
Accelmed makes significant equity investments – or a combination of equity and debt – of between $20M and $50M per platform. In certain cases, in combination with its co-investing partners, investment can be increased to up to $300M.
We intend to acquire a significant interest in established medical device companies (in the US, Europe and potentially in China) with revenues in excess of $30M and which have an experienced direct sales force.
 

 
Proceeds of our investments will be used for both organic and inorganic growth through the acquisition and integration of innovative market ready medical device technologies identified and selected by Accelmed and the platform company management.
The acquired Israeli start-ups will serve as ongoing sources for cost-efficient R&D as, based on Accelmed’s proven experience with Israeli R&D teams,  they are not only innovative but also operate in a faster and more efficient way than their peers overseas.
 


 

 


Platform Case Studies




Endochoice – Platform Model Case Study
The Platform Model modus operandi is best illustrated through the merger between Peer Medical, an Israeli company and developer of the Full Spectrum Endoscope, and EndoChoice, a gastroenterology (GI) player in Atlanta, GA, which had a solid commercial infrastructure but which lacked innovative products.
By merging Peer into EndoChoice and the addition of working capital, Accelmed was able to transform EndoChoice from a commodity player into a cutting edge technology company. The merger, carried out in 2013, led to Endochoice’s emergence as a leading, global, GI player with sales above $75M in 2015 (more than doubled since the merger), high double-digit growth and a presence in more than 25 countries. EndoChoice completed a successful IPO on June 2015 and was sold to Boston Scientific in October 2016.
 

 
 
 
OIS – Platform Model Case Study
OIS is another example of the successful deployment of Accelmed’s Platform Model.
OIS, a California-based ophthalmic imaging systems player, acquired MediVision, the developer of an innovative retinal camera based on Israeli defense technology. The deal was financed and led by Accelmed, which held 44% of OIS’s shares post-merger in 2009. Within two years, OIS was sold, providing Accelmed with an outstanding return.

Next generation novel hybrid laser - mechanical system, provides a safe solution for more than 12 million patients in the United States - a market of over $1 billion

REHOVOT, Israel, April 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --

Eximo Medical, a medical device company that is developing a laser system and unique catheters for the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD), has successfully completed a multicenter clinical trial for the purpose of obtaining CE approval for marketing in Europe. The results of the trial indicate that use of the Eximo system provides a safe, precise and highly efficacious solution in cases of partial blockage, complete blockage and severe calcification. The trial, which was led by two physicians from Poland, included 20 patients, some of whom required bypass surgery or leg amputation and are no longer at risk of amputation following the treatment.

Eximo was founded by Accelmed, a medical device investment fund, in 2012. In July 2015, Eximo completed its round A investment, led by Accelmed. Following the success of the trial, the company is now pursuing CE Mark and will be looking to receive FDA approval in 2017.

The Eximo system is based on a solid-state ultraviolet laser with a wavelength of 355 nm. The system is connected to a hybrid catheter, which combines tissue ablation by means of the laser and resection with a blunt mechanical blade. Eximo is the first company in the world to have succeeded in actively combining a 355 nm laser with a mechanical blade in a way that enables a high level of accuracy in cutting through vascular blockages. Eximo's proprietary hybrid laser-mechanical blade design removes blockages irrespective of the type of blockage or the size of the blood vessel, and increases the efficacy and safety of performance while reducing the risk of puncturing the blood vessel, compared to competing technologies.

Vascular blockage of the lower extremities is the main cause of 66% of limb amputations in the United States (approximately 120,000 amputations per year), with an estimated total cost of $8.3 billion to the US health system. Treatment with the system developed by Eximo will enable the blockage to be efficiently and safely eliminated, saving many patients from limb amputations. Today, there are over 12 million PAD patients in the United States and the market size is estimated to be in excess of $1 billion.

Dr. Waclaw Kuczmik, Senior surgeon at the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland, stated: "We are proud to be the first medical center in the world to have treated patients with the Eximo system. The treatment of all 14 patients by us was highly successful, without any complications. All of the patients have experienced significant pain relief in the treated limb and significant improvement in quality of life."

Yoel Zabar, CEO of Eximo, stated: "We are pleased to announce the successful completion of a first-in-human study with a PAD application, which constitutes a significant milestone that will enable the receipt of CE marketing approval in Europe. We are proud that thanks to the unique technology developed by our company, we were able to alleviate patients' suffering and prevent complicated, unnecessary surgeries, which could, in extreme cases, even have led to amputation of the leg. The completion of the trial represents an additional significant step toward a multi-participant FDA trial in the United States - a potential market of billions of dollars."

About Eximo: 

Eximo Medical Ltd., which is located in Rehovot, is an Israeli company that was founded in 2012 by Accelmed. The company is devoted to developing efficacious and safe solutions for the treatment of vascular blockages. The company's catheters are based on an innovative hybrid technology, which includes a combination of a compact laser system and mechanical elements.

Eximo's future products include solutions for the removal of pacemaker electrodes (LE - Lead Extraction) in cases of damage to the electrode or infection, and, at a later stage, catheters for procedures in the digestive tract.

In March 2016, Eximo won the Innovative Company Award at the IDSS Electrophysiology Conference.

The founders of the company and a scientific consulting committee, which includes renowned specialists from American and Israeli medical institutes, support the Eximo Medical management team.

About Accelmed:

Accelmed is the largest pure play medical device fund in Israel. Accelmed focuses on global investments in mature companies that might serve as a platform to Israeli companies and also builds companies that develop innovative medical devices solutions for major markets - such as diabetes, obesity and heart diseases - in which there is currently no medical solution. Since it was founded in 2009 by Mori Arkin, the chairman of the investment committee, and Dr. Uri Geiger, the managing partner, Accelmed has made 18 investments in medical device companies, including M&A and IPO of five of them.

Valcare Medical, an Accelmed Portfolio Company, Announces Successful First-In-Human Procedures of the Amend™ Catheter Delivered Annuloplasty Ring






Jun 20, 2016, 8:00am EDT














HERZLIYA, Israel, June 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Novel semi-rigid, 'D' shaped ring provides a minimally invasive solution for Mitral Valve Regurgitation - a market of over $3 billion in the US alone
Expands Management Team with Appointment of Mr. Shuki Porath as CEO to lead clinical development and commercialization to current and new markets
Valcare Medical, an Accelmed portfolio company, the developer of novel medical devices for minimally invasive treatment of Mitral Valve Regurgitation, announced today the successful completion of first phase of the its First-In-Human (FIH) multi-center clinical trial, taking place in Israel and Europe.
Valcare developed The Amend™ Mitral Valve Repair Annuloplasty ring, a semi-rigid, a 'D' shaped ring that emulates the current gold standard for patients who suffer from Mitral Valve Regurgitation (the valve that controls blood flow between the left atrium and left ventricle). In a series of cases, the ring was successfully Trans apically delivered through an advanced, catheter-based delivery system, and was secured to the annulus by a series of novel integral anchors.
"The procedure was performed on a high surgical risk patient, in a minimally-invasive transapical approach and in a relatively short time", stated Prof. Amit Segev, Director, Cardiac Catheterization Services at The Heart Center at Sheba Medical Center, Israel and Prof. Ehud Ra'anani, Head of the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department who performed one of the procedures. "Using the Valcare system we were able to repair the patient's mitral valve and significantly reduce valvular incompetence, reducing MR from sever (4+) to trace (1). We are excited to be one the first centers in the world to use this novel technology to help our patients."
Additionally, Valcare's Amend™ system was implanted successfully by the heart team at Shaare Zedek Medical Center Interventional Cardiology laboratories in Jerusalem (Dr. Almagor & Dr. Mirkeen) and in a compassionate care procedure performed in April by Professor Gino Gerosa and Dr. Andrea Colli, Cardiac Surgeons from the Padova University Hospital in Italy.
Alongside the clinical progress, the company announced the expansion of its management team and the appointment of Mr. Shuki Porath as CEO. Mr. Shuki Porath has over 20 years of medical device senior managerial experience, including product management, business development, commercialization and clinical applications. Prior to joining Valcare Medical, Mr. Porath served as President & CEO at Keystone Heart, and as Senior Executive at Biosense Webster, a Johnson & Johnson Company. Mr. Porath holds a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering, M.Sc. and MBA - all from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. Sam Shaolian, the founder of Valcare and inventor of the technology, will become the CTO of the company and continue to lead the future products of the company.
Uri Geiger, Managing Partner of Accelmed and Valcare's Chairman of the Board commented, "We are excited with the successful completion of the first implantations of the Amend™ system and thrilled to welcome Shuki Porath to Valcare, leading its clinical development and commercialization to current and new markets. Valcare's novel technology is a pioneering breakthrough for the treatment of Mitral valve regurgitation and could be a base for additional modalities for treatment of other valve disorders. The team is currently focusing on adapting the delivery technique to a transeptal approach allowing for deployment of the system through a puncture in the groin, as well as using the system to treat tricuspid incompetence, another extremely common problem. In addition, we have explored this novel technology, using the ring as a landing zone to support a mitral valve prosthesis in pre-clinical studies, generating interest from a number of other companies active in this arena, as this provides another opportunity to treat patients with conditions that may be more suitable for heart valve replacement than repair."
The Amend™ system is expected to address the $5 Billion market ($3 Billion in the US alone) for medical devices geared towards minimally invasive treatment of Mitral Valve disease. A recently granted US patent on the Valve in Ring enables Valcare to use the Amend™ device also for the replacement of the mitral valve and for tricuspid vale repair.
About Valcare Medical: 
Valcare Medical, based in Herzliya Pituach, Israel, develops advanced medical implants and delivery systems for the treatment of Heart Valve regurgitation in a minimally invasive manner. The Valcare Amend™ System is the first device, aimed for treatment of Mitral Valve Regurgitation, and currently under clinical study by the company.
ValCare Medical was founded in 2012 by Accelmed Fund, as part of its 'Targeted Innovation' model. Accelmed, and ValCare Medical's Founder and CTO, Samuel Shaolian, established the company based on technology spanned off Micardia Corporation to leverage the expertise and experience of the leading technical and clinical experts in the field of heart surgery and Cardiology to develop break though technologies for patients suffering from heart disease.

Eximo Medical, an Accelmed portfolio Company, Announces the Successful Completion of a Multi-Center First-In-Human Trial in Europe with a Hybrid Catheter for Treating Complex Lesions in Peripheral Blood Vessels

		  Next generation novel hybrid laser - mechanical system, provides a safe solution for more than 12 million patients in the United States - a market of over $1 billion

REHOVOT, Israel, April 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Eximo Medical, a medical device company that is developing a laser system and unique catheters for the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD), has successfully completed a multicenter clinical trial for the purpose of obtaining CE approval for marketing in Europe. The results of the trial indicate that use of the Eximo system provides a safe, precise and highly efficacious solution in cases of partial blockage, complete blockage and severe calcification. The trial, which was led by two physicians from Poland, included 20 patients, some of whom required bypass surgery or leg amputation and are no longer at risk of amputation following the treatment.
Eximo was founded by Accelmed, a medical device investment fund, in 2012. In July 2015, Eximo completed its round A investment, led by Accelmed. Following the success of the trial, the company is now pursuing CE Mark and will be looking to receive FDA approval in 2017.
The Eximo system is based on a solid-state ultraviolet laser with a wavelength of 355 nm. The system is connected to a hybrid catheter, which combines tissue ablation by means of the laser and resection with a blunt mechanical blade. Eximo is the first company in the world to have succeeded in actively combining a 355 nm laser with a mechanical blade in a way that enables a high level of accuracy in cutting through vascular blockages. Eximo's proprietary hybrid laser-mechanical blade design removes blockages irrespective of the type of blockage or the size of the blood vessel, and increases the efficacy and safety of performance while reducing the risk of puncturing the blood vessel, compared to competing technologies.
Vascular blockage of the lower extremities is the main cause of 66% of limb amputations in the United States (approximately 120,000 amputations per year), with an estimated total cost of $8.3 billion to the US health system. Treatment with the system developed by Eximo will enable the blockage to be efficiently and safely eliminated, saving many patients from limb amputations. Today, there are over 12 million PAD patients in the United States and the market size is estimated to be in excess of $1 billion.
Dr. Waclaw Kuczmik, Senior surgeon at the  Medical University of Silesia  in Katowice, Poland, stated: "We are proud to be the first medical center in the world to have treated patients with the Eximo system. The treatment of all 14 patients by us was highly successful, without any complications. All of the patients have experienced significant pain relief in the treated limb and significant improvement in quality of life."
Yoel Zabar, CEO of Eximo, stated: "We are pleased to announce the successful completion of a first-in-human study with a PAD application, which constitutes a significant milestone that will enable the receipt of CE marketing approval in Europe. We are proud that thanks to the unique technology developed by our company, we were able to alleviate patients' suffering and prevent complicated, unnecessary surgeries, which could, in extreme cases, even have led to amputation of the leg. The completion of the trial represents an additional significant step toward a multi-participant FDA trial in the United States - a potential market of billions of dollars."
About Eximo: 
Eximo Medical Ltd., which is located in Rehovot, is an Israeli company that was founded in 2012 by Accelmed. The company is devoted to developing efficacious and safe solutions for the treatment of vascular blockages. The company's catheters are based on an innovative hybrid technology, which includes a combination of a compact laser system and mechanical elements.
Eximo's future products include solutions for the removal of pacemaker electrodes (LE - Lead Extraction) in cases of damage to the electrode or infection, and, at a later stage, catheters for procedures in the digestive tract.
In March 2016, Eximo won the Innovative Company Award at the IDSS Electrophysiology Conference.
The founders of the company and a scientific consulting committee, which includes renowned specialists from American and Israeli medical institutes, support the Eximo Medical management team.

Cogentix Medical Enters Into Definitive Agreement For $25 Million Equity Investment

- Proceeds to Provide Resources to Execute Urology Focused Business Development Strategy
- Proposed Equity Investment at 29% Premium to Market
- All Current Outstanding Debt to be Converted into Common Shares

MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Cogentix Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CGNT), a medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets innovative proprietary products for the urology market, today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with Accelmed Growth Partners, L.P.  Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement, Accelmed would purchase $25 million of Cogentix Medical common stock from the Company at $1.55 per share, a 29% premium over the closing price of the stock on September 6, 2016 and a premium of 36% over the average closing price over the last 30 days.  The securities purchase agreement is subject to various closing conditions, including approval by the shareholders of Cogentix Medical.  Accelmed is a premier capital resource for the medical device industry and is based in New York, NY and Hertzeliya, Israel.  Cogentix would apply the proceeds to working capital as well as the implementation of a business development strategy to acquire growth technologies addressing the urology market.As a condition to Accelmed closing the equity investment, the Company will convert into common shares all the outstanding debt and accrued interest owed to Lewis C. Pell, one of the Company's Class I directors.  Cogentix currently owes a total of $29.5 million ($28.5 million of principal and $1.0 million of accrued interest) to Mr. Pell.  The Company and Mr. Pell have entered into a definitive agreement under which the debt owed by Cogentix to Mr. Pell will be converted into Cogentix common stock at a price per share of $1.67 immediately prior to closing the Accelmed securities purchase agreement.  The agreement also provides that, simultaneously with the conversion of such debt, all outstanding warrants to purchase Cogentix common stock that are held by Mr. Pell will be cancelled. The agreement with Mr. Pell is subject to approval of the shareholders of Cogentix Medical."The proposed transaction with Accelmed has the ability to transform Cogentix Medical," said Darin Hammers, President and CEO of Cogentix Medical.  "While our team has been successfully executing our sales strategy and building our business in the urology market, we have been resource constrained in terms of providing our sales organization with additional products to bring to our growing customer base.  Accelmed is one of the world's leading private equity firms focused on the medical device industry, and as Israel's largest med-tech investor, has a proven track record of integrating Israeli technologies into established US med-tech companies.  Accelmed believes the Cogentix platform provides an excellent foundation from which to build a broad based leader providing innovative, cost effective and clinically proven solutions to the growing urology marketplace.  Overall, the proposed transactions significantly increase our cash resources, eliminate all of our outstanding debt and dramatically improve our capital structure, all at valuations that are 29% higher than what the market is currently awarding our company."Upon closing of the proposed transactions, there would be approximately 60.3 million shares of common stock outstanding of which Mr. Pell would own approximately 33% and Accelmed would own approximately 27%.  The current debt and accrued interest outstanding of $29.5 million would be eliminated and Cogentix would have approximately $28 million of cash and marketable securities.  In addition, the terms of the proposed transaction call for Accelmed to have the right to nominate two members to the Cogentix Medical Board of Directors, which currently has six members.  One of these directors would be Uri Geiger, who will become Chair of the Cogentix board. Mr. Geiger cofounded Accelmed in 2009 and is currently a managing partner of Accelmed. Mr. Geiger has extensive entrepreneurial, management and investment expertise having created and developed many successful medical device companies.The Board of Directors of Cogentix Medical established a Special Committee of the Board, comprised solely of independent directors, to review these transactions and provide a recommendation to the full Board.  The Special Committee engaged Duff & Phelps, LLC to serve as its independent financial advisor and to provide an opinion in connection with the proposed transactions.  The Special Committee retained Duff & Phelps based on Duff & Phelps' qualifications, reputation, and experience in providing fairness opinions, and its experience in valuing companies in the medical device industry. Duff & Phelps has rendered its opinion that the financial terms of the proposed transactions taken as a whole are fair to the unaffiliated public stockholders of the Company.  The Special Committee recommended to the full Board that it approve the transactions, and the Cogentix Medical Board of Directors has unanimously approved the transactions."We have admired the revenue growth of Cogentix Medical under the leadership of Darin and his team, and believe that with the appropriate resources and a well-planned business development strategy, Cogentix could expand into being one of the leaders in the urology marketplace," said Mr. Geiger.  "As a reflection of our confidence in the management team as well as the potential for the company, we have agreed to make this investment at a premium to the current market price and look forward to working with the board and management to execute on a shared vision for Cogentix."Additional Information About the Transaction and Where to Find ItThe proposed transactions will be submitted to the shareholders of Cogentix Medical for their approval.  The shareholders will be asked to approve the securities purchase agreement and the issuance of shares to Accelmed and Mr. Pell.

HERZLIYA, Israel, June 20, 2016
HERZLIYA, Israel, June 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Novel semi-rigid, 'D' shaped ring provides a minimally invasive solution for Mitral Valve Regurgitation - a market of over $3 billion in the US alone
Expands Management Team with Appointment of Mr. Shuki Porath as CEO to lead clinical development and commercialization to current and new markets
Valcare Medical, an Accelmed portfolio company, the developer of novel medical devices for minimally invasive treatment of Mitral Valve Regurgitation, announced today the successful completion of first phase of the its First-In-Human (FIH) multi-center clinical trial, taking place in Israel and Europe.
Valcare developed The Amend™ Mitral Valve Repair Annuloplasty ring, a semi-rigid, a 'D' shaped ring that emulates the current gold standard for patients who suffer from Mitral Valve Regurgitation (the valve that controls blood flow between the left atrium and left ventricle). In a series of cases, the ring was successfully Trans apically delivered through an advanced, catheter-based delivery system, and was secured to the annulus by a series of novel integral anchors.
"The procedure was performed on a high surgical risk patient, in a minimally-invasive transapical approach and in a relatively short time", stated Prof.Amit Segev,Director, Cardiac Catheterization Services at The Heart Centerat Sheba Medical Center, Israel and Prof.Ehud Ra'anani, Head of the Cardiothoracic Surgery Departmentwho performed one of the procedures. "Using the Valcare system we were able to repair the patient's mitral valve and significantly reduce valvular incompetence, reducing MR from sever (4+) to trace (1). We are excited to be one the first centers in the world to use this novel technology to help our patients."
Additionally, Valcare's Amend™ system was implanted successfully by the heart team at Shaare Zedek Medical Center Interventional Cardiology laboratories in Jerusalem (Dr. Almagor & Dr. Mirkeen) and in a compassionate care procedure performed in April by Professor Gino Gerosa and Dr. Andrea Colli, Cardiac Surgeons from the Padova University Hospital in Italy.
Alongside the clinical progress, the company announced the expansion of its management team and the appointment of Mr. Shuki Porath as CEO. Mr. Shuki Porath has over 20 years of medical device senior managerial experience, including product management, business development, commercialization and clinical applications. Prior to joining Valcare Medical, Mr. Porath served as President & CEO at Keystone Heart, and as Senior Executive at Biosense Webster, a Johnson & Johnson Company. Mr. Porath holds a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering, M.Sc. and MBA - all from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. Sam Shaolian, the founder of Valcare and inventor of the technology, will become the CTO of the company and continue to lead the future products of the company.


            Uri Geiger,
Managing Partner of Accelmed and
Val

'
s Chairman of the Board commented, "We are excited with the successful completion of the first implantations of the Amend™ system and thrilled to welcome Shuki Porath to Valcare, leading its clinical development and commercialization to current and new markets. Valcare's novel technology is a pioneering breakthrough for the treatment of Mitral valve regurgitation and could be a base for additional modalities for treatment of other valve disorders. The team is currently focusing on adapting the delivery technique to a transeptal approach allowing for deployment of the system through a puncture in the groin, as well as using the system to treat tricuspid incompetence, another extremely common problem. In addition, we have explored this novel technology, using the ring as a landing zone to support a mitral valve prosthesis in pre-clinical studies, generating interest from a number of other companies active in this arena, as this provides another opportunity to treat patients with conditions that may be more suitable for heart valve replacement than repair."
The Amend™ system is expected to address the $5 Billion market ($3 Billion in the US alone) for medical devices geared towards minimally invasive treatment of Mitral Valve disease. A recently granted US patent on the Valve in Ring enables Valcare to use the Amend™ device also for the replacement of the mitral valve and for tricuspid vale repair.

About Valcare Medical: 
Valcare Medical, based in Herzliya Pituach, Israel, develops advanced medical implants and delivery systems for the treatment of Heart Valve regurgitation in a minimally invasive manner. The Valcare Amend™ System is the first device, aimed for treatment of Mitral Valve Regurgitation, and currently under clinical study by the company.
ValCare Medical was founded in 2012 by Accelmed Fund, as part of its 'Targeted Innovation' model. Accelmed, and ValCare Medical's Founder and CTO, Samuel Shaolian, established the company based on technology spanned off Micardia Corporation to leverage the expertise and experience of the leading technical and clinical experts in the field of heart surgery and Cardiology to develop break though technologies for patients suffering from heart disease.

REHOVOT, Israel, April 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Eximo Medical, a medical device company that is developing a laser system and unique catheters for the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD), has successfully completed a multicenter clinical trial for the purpose of obtaining CE approval for marketing in Europe. The results of the trial indicate that use of the Eximo system provides a safe, precise and highly efficacious solution in cases of partial blockage, complete blockage and severe calcification. The trial, which was led by two physicians from Poland, included 20 patients, some of whom required bypass surgery or leg amputation and are no longer at risk of amputation following the treatment.
Eximo was founded by Accelmed, a medical device investment fund, in 2012. In July 2015, Eximo completed its round A investment, led by Accelmed. Following the success of the trial, the company is now pursuing CE Mark and will be looking to receive FDA approval in 2017.
The Eximo system is based on a solid-state ultraviolet laser with a wavelength of 355 nm. The system is connected to a hybrid catheter, which combines tissue ablation by means of the laser and resection with a blunt mechanical blade. Eximo is the first company in the world to have succeeded in actively combining a 355 nm laser with a mechanical blade in a way that enables a high level of accuracy in cutting through vascular blockages. Eximo's proprietary hybrid laser-mechanical blade design removes blockages irrespective of the type of blockage or the size of the blood vessel, and increases the efficacy and safety of performance while reducing the risk of puncturing the blood vessel, compared to competing technologies.
Vascular blockage of the lower extremities is the main cause of 66% of limb amputations in the United States (approximately 120,000 amputations per year), with an estimated total cost of $8.3 billion to the US health system. Treatment with the system developed by Eximo will enable the blockage to be efficiently and safely eliminated, saving many patients from limb amputations. Today, there are over 12 million PAD patients in the United States and the market size is estimated to be in excess of $1 billion.
Dr. Waclaw Kuczmik, Senior surgeon at the  Medical University of Silesia  in Katowice, Poland, stated: "We are proud to be the first medical center in the world to have treated patients with the Eximo system. The treatment of all 14 patients by us was highly successful, without any complications. All of the patients have experienced significant pain relief in the treated limb and significant improvement in quality of life."
Yoel Zabar, CEO of Eximo, stated: "We are pleased to announce the successful completion of a first-in-human study with a PAD application, which constitutes a significant milestone that will enable the receipt of CE marketing approval in Europe. We are proud that thanks to the unique technology developed by our company, we were able to alleviate patients' suffering and prevent complicated, unnecessary surgeries, which could, in extreme cases, even have led to amputation of the leg. The completion of the trial represents an additional significant step toward a multi-participant FDA trial in the United States - a potential market of billions of dollars."
About Eximo: 
Eximo Medical Ltd., which is located in Rehovot, is an Israeli company that was founded in 2012 by Accelmed. The company is devoted to developing efficacious and safe solutions for the treatment of vascular blockages. The company's catheters are based on an innovative hybrid technology, which includes a combination of a compact laser system and mechanical elements.
Eximo's future products include solutions for the removal of pacemaker electrodes (LE - Lead Extraction) in cases of damage to the electrode or infection, and, at a later stage, catheters for procedures in the digestive tract.
In March 2016, Eximo won the Innovative Company Award at the IDSS Electrophysiology Conference.
The founders of the company and a scientific consulting committee, which includes renowned specialists from American and Israeli medical institutes, support the Eximo Medical management team.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.
