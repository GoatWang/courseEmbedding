Anheuser-Busch InBev Acquires Energy Drink Maker Hiball



Chris Furnari



Jul. 20, 2017 at 4:48 PM 












One year after inking a deal with coffee giant Starbucks, the world’s largest beer company is making another investment in the non-alcoholic beverage segment.
Anheuser-Busch InBev today announced plans to acquire Hiball Inc., a San Francisco-based beverage company founded in 2005 that markets a range of caffeinated beverages, including energy drinks, sparkling waters and cold brew coffees. The company also makes a line of non-caffeinated juices and seltzers, called Alta Palla.

“We are thrilled to partner with a company that shares our vision for where we can take Hiball Energy and Alta Palla in the future, and brings real passion and dedication to their work every day,” Hiball founder Todd Berardi said in a press release. “This deal is the beginning of a new and exciting chapter for me and my team, and I can’t wait to get started.”
Specific financial terms were not disclosed, but Anheuser-Busch CEO João Castro Neves said his company would purchase 100 percent of Hiball Inc. in a deal that would be structured to include earn-outs and various growth incentives.
The two companies expect the transaction to close during the third quarter of 2017.
“Todd, Alyssa, Dan and the entire Hiball team have created an incredible business, developing some of the fastest-growing brands in the beverage industry and giving their loyal consumers the choices they love,” Castro Neves said via a press release. “We are very happy to partner with these three entrepreneurs and invest to help them achieve their dreams.”

The purchase comes about 14 months after A-B agreed to manufacture and distribute a ready-to-drink version of Starbucks’ popular Teavana product.
In an interview with Brewbound, Castro Neves said both the Hiball investment and A-B’s partnership with Starbucks are part of a broader strategy aimed at “growing beyond beer” and a “desire” to advance the company’s position in the non-alcoholic space — a process that began about two years ago.
“Part of the due-diligence was to know where growth was going to come from,” he said. “We saw premium, ready-to-drink tea being a place that is growing, but we also see big growth coming [from other areas] in the future. We also saw energy, and sparkling waters. Those three, more than anything else, were growing fast.”
According to data from market research IRI Worldwide, sales of energy drinks were up about 4 percent during the 52-week period ending May 14. Sales of sparkling waters and teas, meanwhile, were up 16 percent and 7 percent, respectively, during the same period.

The acquisition of Hiball does more than give A-B a foothold in the growing energy and sparkling water categories; it enables the beer company to supply its nationwide distributor network with a broader array of non-alcoholic offerings, particularly an energy drink, something wholesalers lost in 2014 when Coca-Cola paid more than $2 billion for a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corporation. As part of that deal, Coke and Monster amended their distribution agreement in the U.S. and pulled the energy drink brand from many A-B wholesalers who had played a key role in growing sales at independent retailers and on-premise accounts.
“One of the things that we bring to the table is this amazing wholesaler network and our focus on route to market,” Castro Neves said. “We have been discussing this non-alcoholic strategy with them for the past two years, and they all like that a lot.”
Berardi, who spoke to A-B wholesalers during a conference call this morning, described A-B distributors as being “hungry for non-alcoholic items.”
“That makes us even more excited about this partnership,” he said. “We all want to create something big, and that is what makes this partnership so exciting for our team.”

In the press release, David Stokes, the CEO of Grey Eagle Distributors and the chair of A-B’s wholesaler advisory panel, praised the deal, calling Hiball a “great addition” to his company’s “developing” non-alcoholic portfolio.
“We have been asking A-B for a partnership opportunity just like this,” he said. “Adding these outstanding brands to our wholesaler system increases the breadth of our product portfolio and strengthens our network as we offer more innovation to our customers.”
Castro Neves stressed, however, that the purchase of Hiball wasn’t driven by a need to “replace” Monster in the A-B network. Instead, he said, it was a strategic move aimed at complementing A-B’s already expansive beer portfolio.
“The fact that the A-B network did so well — and according to everyone I spoke with, they are part of the explanation on Monster’s success – it gives me the confidence, that if we have done it once, we can do it twice,” Castro Neves said of bringing a non-alcoholic beverage brand to market.
“High growth and high margins is something that they [wholesalers] look for, and therefore I think it will be a win-win for all of us,” he added.
Hiball is distributed in 50 states with a mix of natural products distributors, including UNFI and KeHe, Berardi told Brewbound. A-B is planning a “phased transition” of Hiball brands into its network, but an official timeline was not disclosed.
Hiball’s products will continue to be made at existing U.S. co-packing facilities, Berardi added, but that could change over the next 24 months as A-B determines if it will make additional brewery investments that would improve its ability to produce non-alcoholic drinks.
“Now is about planning the next phase,” Castro Neves said. “This will come into discussion at a point in time, but we are focusing on the topline right now.”
All 20 Hiball employees will remain with the company, Berardi said, and Michael Taylor, the current vice president of ABI’s North America Zone, will transition into a new role as the head Hiball and Alta Palla. He will also continue to serve on the board of directors for Craft Brew Alliance, which is 31.6 percent owned by A-B, but that position could be re-evaluated, Castro Neves said.

Anheuser-Busch InBev ups soft drinks presence with Hiball and Alta Palla purchases in US

By Andy Morton | 20 July 2017
Font size    Email  Print




Anheuser-Busch said the Hiball transaction is expected to close in Q3
Anheuser-Busch InBev's US unit has acquired two energy drinks and sparkling water brands in the country, as it looks to increase its presence in non-alcoholic beverages.
Anheuser-Busch said today that it has bought Hiball, the producer of organic energy drinks and sparkling energy waters by the same name, as well as Alta Palla ("high ball" in Italian), a brand of organic sparkling juices and sparkling waters. Financial details behind the purchases were not disclosed.
Hiball's energy drinks and sparkling energy waters are made with a proprietary blend, consisting of caffeine, guarana, and ginseng. AB said the products target some of the "most important trends in the beverage space today", including health and wellness, natural and sustainably-sourced ingredients and energy-boosting products. 
AB president & CEO João Castro Neves said: "The combination of Hiball's category-leading organic energy drinks and Alta Palla's organic sparkling juices and sparkling waters together with our network and operational know-how will create tremendous growth opportunities for these brands. Our goal is to deliver Hiball products to new markets, while preserving their culture and brand identities."
Hiball was formed in 2005 and now has 20 employees. Founder & president Todd Berardi, his wife Alyssa Warnock and Dan Craytor will continue to lead the business, AB said.
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter.
In February, Starbucks started the US roll-out of the RTD variant of the Teavana tea brand, which is produced in partnership with AB. The brewer also handles the Icelandic Glacial water brand in the US. 
At AB InBev's general shareholders meeting last year, CEO Carlos Brito identified the no- and low-alcohol as one of the fastest growing trends in the drinks world. However, Brito also said the company would focus on the beer category. "We don't believe in going too much outside beer," he was reported as saying.

 The world's largest brewer Anheuser Busch InBev (>> Anheuser-Busch InBev) said on Thursday it was acquiring Hiball, a San Francisco-based producer of energy drinks and owner of the Alta Palla brand of organic sparkling juices and sparkling waters.

The world's largest brewer Anheuser Busch InBev (>> Anheuser-Busch InBev) said on Thursday it was acquiring Hiball, a San Francisco-based producer of energy drinks and owner of the Alta Palla brand of organic sparkling juices and sparkling waters.
The acquisition marks another step into the non-alcoholic drinks sector for the company, which already produces the ready-to-drink tea Teavana in partnership with Starbucks (>> Starbucks Corporation).
AB InBev said in May it planned to invest $2 billion in the United States through 2020 into both breweries and soft drinks.
"Hiball's products target some of the most important trends in the beverage space today, including health and wellness," the company said in a statement.
AB InBev said it planned a phased transition of the Hiball Energy and Alta Palla brands to its wholesaler partners.
The transaction, the terms of which were not disclosed, is expected to close in the third quarter.

Regional performance





North America


North America delivered solid financial performance with 2.0% normalized EBITDA growth, the highest in the last four years - achieved while making major investments in sales and marketing. Despite a weakened industry, the US was able to deliver flat full year revenue, with lower volumes offset by revenue per hl growth, driven by revenue management initiatives and favorable brand mix.
Our market share trend is improving in the U.S. thanks to strong performance from Michelob Ultra and our portfolio of high-end brands, as well as improvement in our value brands. Our positioning of Michelob Ultra as a lifestyle brand led to double-digit growth and seven consecutive quarters of share gains. We’re also gaining share with high-end brands Stella Artois and Goose Island.
Strong advertising campaigns and activations like the Made in America festival are helping stabilize Budweiser in the U.S. We have work to do on our largest U.S. brand, Bud Light, and have transitioned to a new platform, Famous Among Friends," grounded in Bud Light's role cementing friendships over time.
We are connecting with sports lovers in the U.S. in innovative new ways. For more than 30 years, we have been the leader in sports marketing, and we are revolutionizing our approach to deliver richer fan experiences. In 2016, we signed new deals with the NFL and the NBA, have adopted a more focused approach to team sponsorships, and launched our eSports initiative. We remain a leader in digital and social media executions and continue to experiment with new technologies. We are also forging authentic connections in the Hispanic market, through our first Spanish-language Super Bowl ad for Bud Light and activations across Hispanic passion points like the NFL and the Copa America Centenario.
In 2017, we are focused on improving market share performance with Budweiser, Bud Light and Michelob Ultra, supported by our portfolio of value brands and regional bets like Estrella Jalisco, which launched in several states in March. We are looking outside beer to innovations like the Teavana ready-to-drink line and our flavored malt beverage offerings, including the SpikedSeltzer brand, which is new to the portfolio.  We will also continue to invest in our craft brands to develop these future growth engines.





Latin America North


We had a very difficult year in Brazil in 2016. Our beer volumes were down -6.6% for the year, driven by continued pressure on consumer disposable income. Net revenue declined by -5.3% with net revenue per hl up 1.2%.
As part of our revenue management strategy, we are using our complete portfolio of packs and brands to achieve attractive, more competitive consumer price points. This includes growing our mix of returnable glass bottles (RGBs), a format that now accounts for 25% of our volume in the supermarket channel. While RGBs have a negative impact on net revenue per hl, they can help boost EBITDA and margin over time.
Although 2016 has been a very challenging year in Brazil, we remain optimistic about the future for our business. We expect that favorable demographics, the closing of regional disparities in per capita incomes and consumer demand for innovative and premium products will help drive long-term growth.





Latin America South


Despite outstanding performance from our global brands and overall business growth in Paraguay and Chile, our Latin America South zone had a tough 2016. We saw contraction in consumption and the industry in Argentina due to structural reforms, higher tariffs and high inflation. Solid revenue management and cost controls helped offset volume declines in the zone, and price increases in line with inflation helped the top-line grow 16.9% for the year.
There were several bright spots. Corona and Budweiser both enjoyed significant double-digit net revenue growth. The Corona SunSets platform continues to grow and perform well in the region, and hosted its second winter festival at a ski resort in Farellones, Chile, in August. Buenos Aires was one of four global cities to experience the 360-degree Stella Artois “Le Savoir” series.
Despite the weak economic backdrop, Brahma grew beer volumes in Argentina, as did Corona in the premium space. Craft brand Patagonia nearly doubled volumes in 2016. It welcomed beer lovers to its rustic microbrewery in Bariloche, overlooking Moreno Lake, where visitors can enjoy special limited edition beers and regional cuisine. The brand also opened 23 “refugio” bars made from shipping containers in various locations around Argentina.
In 2017 we are looking to drive growth through supporting our global brands, stabilizing Quilmes and continuing initiatives related to affordability and convenience.





Latin America West


Our Latin America West region, which includes Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, delivered solid results in 2016, led by continued strength in Mexico. Beer volumes for the region grew 5.9%, with top-line expansion of 9.3%. The industry struggled in Ecuador due to a tough macro environment combined with the aftermath of a strong earthquake in April. The trading environments in Colombia and Peru were less challenging.
Our global brands performed well throughout the region. Corona helped develop the premium segment with its expanded coverage and disruptive consumer experiences via its SunSets platform. In Corona’s home country of Mexico, preference and volume gains for both Corona Extra and Corona Light provided a boost to the brand, which now represents nearly half of our domestic beer sales.
We launched the no-alcohol Corona Cero in Mexico with a “Same Taste, No Alcohol” campaign, and expect it to help create new consumption occasions and increase consumption frequency in the country. Strengthened by consistent positioning efforts, premium brands Club Colombia in Colombia and Cusqueña in Peru delivered double-digit top-line growth. We also continued to develop innovative new options including Bud Light Mang-o-Rita, Victoria Chelada, Victoria Oro, Modelo Trigo, Club Colombia Trigo, Cusqueña Quinua, Redd’s Apple and Pony Malta Plus.





Asia Pacific


A tough macro environment and extreme weather put pressure on the industry in China and South Korea in 2016. Despite stable economies, industry volumes contracted in both markets.  In Australia, a portfolio shift toward contemporary brands such as Great Northern, Pure Blonde and Carlton Dry helped drive momentum as well as market share gains and premiumization initiatives.  Our total volumes across the region declined by 1.2% for the year, but net revenue increased 1.5% due to a favorable brand mix.
A focus on the super-premium segment has helped deliver growth in China and South Korea, with Corona and Hoegaarden leading the way. Budweiser has steadily gained momentum across China, and is the number one premium brand among high-income drinkers. Cass is the market leader in South Korea and delivered a great performance in 2016, with positive momentum across all key segments.
In Australia, we took over distribution rights for Corona, Stella Artois, Budweiser and our other premium brands, as part of the combination with SABMiller. With this move, we have become the market leader in the country. Australia is the most important export market for Corona in terms of volumes. It is the country’s most popular import beer and holds nearly 6% of market share. Stella Artois and Budweiser are smaller brands there today, but represent a tremendous growth opportunity.
Given its population growth, economic environment and growing beer market, India represents a significant opportunity. As a combined entity in India, we are now the second largest brewer with 18 breweries. The increase in scale in the country will help relieve capacity constraints and accelerate the growth of Budweiser and our other global brands in the country.
In Vietnam, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of the opening of our state-of-the-art brewery, which enables us to deliver fresh beer to consumers in Southeast Asia. Budweiser posted double-digit growth in Vietnam in 2016, and its new design was well received by consumers.





Europe, Middle East, and Africa


In our EMEA region, top-line growth increased 4.2% and own beer volumes declined 1.1% in 2016 with particularly strong and consistent performance in Western Europe driven mostly by premiumization initiatives. Our top-line in Western Europe grew 3.4% over 2015. Normalized EBITDA across EMEA grew 3.7%.
Our global and premium brands delivered strong top-line growth in Europe, with standout performance from Corona, Budweiser, Leffe and Cubanisto – which all showed solid double-digit growth.  Stella Artois and Budweiser enjoyed successful activations in Europe, such as Wimbledon and Tomorrowland, and launched new packaging in the UK, including a new Budweiser twist-off bottle.
Beck’s, our top brand in Germany and Italy, launched a new Red Ale variant from Ireland as part of its super-premium Taste of the World range. Leffe Royale Spring, a seasonal variant using Crystal Hops from the U.S. West Coast, helped demonstrate the brand’s premium craftsmanship. Also in France, Cubanisto released a Mojito variant in November. Jupiler, one of our strongest brands, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2016. The brand also launched a new equity campaign and continued to focus on its football and music platforms through Tomorrowland and the Eurocup activation in the summer.  We also launched several no- and low-alcohol innovations across Europe.
We are excited to gain a presence on the African continent, which will play a key role for the company going forward. Africa offers attractive markets with increasing GDPs, a growing middle class and expanding opportunities. It is also becoming more important in the context of the global beer industry: Going forward, a significant portion of beer category growth is likely to come from Africa. It is estimated that, by 2025, Africa will represent approximately 8.1% of the global beer industry by volumes, up from approximately 6.5% in 2014.
We are preparing for the growing importance of the African beer market by positioning our resources and key brands in the largest and fastest-growing markets there, including South Africa, East Africa and Nigeria and Ghana in West Africa. To address future demand from consumers, we will partner with local growers to generate local value and ensure supply.

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

The company also owns distribution rights to Bacardi.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

The company also owns distribution rights to Bacardi.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

The company also owns distribution rights to Bacardi.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev
SUCCESS STORY
If any company can lay claim to guaranteeing access to a cold, crisp bottle of beer, it is Anheuser-Busch. The storied company, whose origins go back to 19-century St. Louis, was the first to invent pasteurization, mechanical refrigeration, and refrigerated railroad cars. Today, Anheuser- Busch InBev (AB InBev) is the largest beer manufacturer in the world (by volume), producing more than 200 of the world’s bestselling regional and international beers, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Beck’s, Michelob, and Skol. In fact, InBev is the leading global brewer and one of the world’s top five consumer product companies.

Challenge

Each year, Anheuser-Busch’s North American operations produces 215 million hectoliters of beer and other beverages (54% of InBev’s total volume) which are bottled, packaged and sold through its network of company-owned and independent wholesalers and retailers. As part of its daily administrative operations and to respond to increasing demand for its products, the beer manufacturer had spent decades adding and replacing printers, copiers, fax machines and scanners as needed, and without much thought. The result: an inefficient, uncoordinated network of mismatched and aging printers and a dizzying and expensive collection of leases and maintenance plans to support them all.


“We had 500 to 600 leased copiers and multifunction devices and a few thousand devices that we owned,” said Jay Emery, Director of Workplace Services IT at Anheuser-Busch InBev’s St. Louis operations. “It was a completely mixed model,” he continued. “For models we owned, we had to buy things like toner and cartridges. For models we leased, toner was included. Maintenance plans weren’t consistent either. Nothing was simple. We knew there was an opportunity for significant savings and that we could put those dollars to better use growing the company.”
The numbers were staggering. An assessment conducted by Lexmark revealed that original Anheuser-Busch output environment contained 307 distinct device models from 19 different manufacturers. Also tell-tale signs of an unmanaged environment, the company had 111 inkjets, 140 fax machines, 14 copiers and a total of 478 wide-format A3 (11x17) devices that were under-utilized.
But despite the condition of its output devices, paper was still operationally critical and the lifeline of getting beer from the cask and into beer cases throughout North America. “If a device goes down and beer can’t be shipped, it’s thousands of dollars an hour that are lost,” Emery said. “I’m not kidding when I say that we always had a printer in the closet as a backup, just in case.”
Furthermore, because Anheuser-Busch’s product is alcohol, specific shipping protocols must be adhered to: Faulty or missing print-outs can botch a delivery. “The most important piece is our bill of lading,” Emery said. “Everything needs to be printed in triplicate. One of the legal requirements from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is that one copy goes with the driver, one copy stays at the brewery and one copy goes to the wholesaler.”



Our goal was to have one print vendor service all of our print and output needs and we were able to accomplish that with Lexmark.

Jay Emery
Director of Workplace Services IT Anheuser-Busch InBev


Paper was pervasive in the back office as well. “People would print something and not even think about it and then, at the end of the day, there were stacks and stacks of paper that were left in the printers and forgotten about,” said Emery. “Every page printed and abandoned was a wasted opportunity to fund growth and innovation.”
An assessment conducted by Lexmark revealed that the devices installed throughout Anheuser-Busch were an average of 6.5 years old. Breakdowns, often caused by the age of the devices, became a costly headache and soon it became clear that Anheuser-Busch’s output environment was not up to par.
Anheuser-Busch also knew that all of that paper, printed and abandoned or even recycled, had an environmental cost too. The company wanted to get serious about reducing paper consumption—for environmental reasons as much as for savings—which had reached “multiple arch proportions.” According to a Lexmark assessment, the brewer’s combined American and Canadian operations produced 61.5 million printed pages in 2011 alone, an amount that, if stacked on top of each other, would be the equivalent of stacking St. Louis’ landmark Gateway Arch 32.5 times. “There weren’t any systems in place to track, manage or control print usage,” Emery acknowledged.
In 2011, the company began looking for a better, more cost effective and greener way to handle output: One that would support its overall business objectives around growth and innovation. Uniformity, ease of use, lower costs and more functionality were all internal priorities.
But even more importantly, Anheuser-Busch wanted all of its entities, including newly acquired companies, locations or wholesalers, to be able to quickly and easily adopt the solution and share in its ease of use and efficiency. “We are frequently acquiring new companies,” Emery said. “When we do, it’s really important for them to have a turnkey solution that they can just move to—a solution that’s easy, and works and helps support their business.”


Solution

All of Anheuser-Busch’s priorities were attainable in the solution from Lexmark: A unified set of networked multi- and single-function printers, under a long-term lease agreement, supported by a multi-year managed print services (MPS) contract to handle the ongoing upkeep and optimization of the fleet and consumables replenishment. “Our goal was to have one print vendor service all of our print and output needs and we were able to accomplish that with Lexmark,” said Emery.


Following an extensive evaluation of suppliers, Anheuser-Busch selected products, solutions and services from Lexmark. Anheuser-Busch began by removing its menagerie of existing devices and installing 1,300 Lexmark devices in 138 locations throughout the U.S. and Canada. The optimized fleet of Lexmark monochrome and color multifunction products (MFPs) and printers represents a 43 percent reduction in the total number of devices Anheuser-Busch now uses for its business operations throughout North America. All the devices are networked and can be shared among employees, regardless of office location and making color, finishing and other advanced features available to everyone.
To tackle the mountain of paper—and to remove systemic inefficiencies for employees—Anheuser-Busch opted for Lexmark’s Print Release solution. This solution queues print jobs and releases them only when job owners authenticate themselves at selected Lexmark devices connected to the network. It also eliminates the time gap between printing and pickup, ensuring that forgotten print jobs do not pile up. After four-hours, print jobs are deleted automatically from the print queue and thereby never printed at all. “The most cost effective page is the one never printed,” said Emery. “We’ve reduced printing by two million pages per month, just by implementing print release and defaulting to duplex.”
Anheuser-Busch also outsourced oversight, management and maintenance to Lexmark under a multi-year managed print services agreement. “Moving to a managed services model is a growing industry trend,” Emery said. “Our philosophy is that if it’s not our core competency, we don’t want to own it. We want operations to support our business and not be a focus of our staff.”
With managed print services, Lexmark proactively monitors the entire fleet of devices, tracking device alerts and conditions. Lexmark technicians perform remote diagnostics and dispatch field engineers when necessary. Lexmark printers and MFPs automatically trigger new toner cartridges to be ordered and shipped directly to that device’s precise location, ensuring that no printer runs out of toner and avoiding the buildup of costly cartridge inventories in each location.



With Lexmark Print Release alone, we’re on track to knock out 20% of wasted printing or two million pages per month.

Jay Emery
Director of Workplace Services IT Anheuser-Busch InBev


Lexmark also collects valuable information about the fleet of devices, providing Anheuser-Busch with data that can be used to make fact-based business decisions. For example, under-utilized devices can be moved to higher-demand areas. Devices removed from the network can be spotted right away. Volume in color printing can be tracked. Spikes in output volume can be investigated to see if there is a better, more cost effective way to accomplish that unique business requirement.
“We are a very data-driven company,” said Emery. “We have used the information about our printing habits to drive cultural change. We partnered with high-volume print departments, such as our people and legal departments, as areas for improvement and we rewarded teams for being ‘most improved’ in terms of their print goals. As we have created a little bit of competition and promoted these successes across business units, our results have continued to grow.”
Changes in printing habits were also fostered through a creative communications plan to employees that started at the top of the executive food chain and that was linked to corporate holidays and other internal events such as World Environmental Day and Arbor Day. Anheuser-Busch’s primary message: Think Before You Print. “Print reduction from an IT perspective is something that our vice president is very passionate about,” said Emery. “He challenges senior leadership, using real data from the Lexmark reports, to do their part.”
Together, Anheuser-Busch and Lexmark orchestrated an aggressive deployment schedule: 138 offices in 60 days. “Lexmark did a fantastic job,” Emery said. The Lexmark team created a deployment schedule that tackled four to eight locations concurrently, coordinating equipment, resources and training all at the same time. “What impressed us was Lexmark’s ability to be nimble, move quickly, and adapt to our changing requirements,” Emery said.
At each of the major locations, Lexmark had already performed site surveys and pulled usage data from the original fleet of devices so that the new Lexmark equipment would be designed to match volume demands and feature requirements. Once the new Lexmark devices were installed, Lexmark staff trained Anheuser-Busch employees how to use the devices and new features and demonstrated how a single device could replace the requirements of four—and still have room to grow. “Having the data made it easier for our employees to embrace the solution and to get behind our cost savings and sustainability goals,” Emery said.


Results

With its new all-Lexmark output infrastructure in place, Anheuser-Busch has been able to reduce the number of printers and devices by 43 percent—from 3,000 to 1,300. With the new, optimized, smaller fleet in place, Anheuser-Busch anticipates saving tens of thousand of dollars annually on maintenance and consumables alone. “By the time we take into account all the toner, paper and maintenance on the old devices, we are looking at savings close to seven figures a year,” Emery said.


Furthermore, the reduction in devices comes with new capabilities that will make it easier for employees to get their work done. “As we told various teams, yes, we’re taking away four of your devices, but here are the whiz-bang gizmos you get instead. You can do more and you still have plenty of room to grow in terms of capacity.”



The big differentiator for us was Lexmark’s willingness to partner with us and truly understand our business challenges and our goals. Our Lexmark partnership is one in which both sides are looking out for each other and trying to make sure that the partnership is a long and valuable one.

Jay Emery
Director of Workplace Services IT Anheuser-Busch InBev


Paper consumption has already shrunk by nearly seven theoretical Gateway Arches. “From a volume perspective, we are so far ahead of where we thought we’d be,” Emery said.
“With Lexmark Print Release alone, we’re on track to knock out 20 percent of wasted printing, or two million pages per month. Down the road, I think we can knock out another 5 percent to 10 percent through by continuing to partner with our higher usage departments such as legal and our people department.”
For Emery, working with Lexmark provided an ideal opportunity to build a longterm relationship that has supported Anheuser-Bush’s goals of eliminating administrative costs in favor of fueling business growth and innovation.
"The big differentiator for us was Lexmark’s willingness to partner with us and truly understand our business challenges and our goals,” said Emery. “Our Lexmark partnership is one in which both sides are looking out for each other and trying to make sure that the partnership is a long and valuable one."

Anheuser-Busch InBev's Clever New Marketing Strategy to the Home-Brew Market
The move is sure to stir the debate over its continued push into craft beer.

Having acquired the country's largest homebrew supplier, Northern Brewer, last year as a means of increasing its exposure to the craft beer market, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE: BUD) has now launched a clever new marketing strategy to tie its growing portfolio of craft beers to home brewers.
Northern Brewer recently began offering starter kits to make homemade versions of some of Anheuser-Busch's most popular craft beer labels in your own kitchen, including Goose Island Brewing, Elysian Brewing, and Golden Road Brewing. And because it's the very same recipes you would get if you bought the beer at the store or in a taproom, it's a subtle way of diluting the distinction between mass-brewed, craft, and home-brewed beer.

One brewer to rule them all
Over the past few years, Anheuser-Busch has made a cottage industry out of buying up craft brewers, much to the consternation of many in the industry, including Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) founder and Chairman Jim Koch, who has decried both A-B's ambitions and those of the craft brewers themselves for selling out.
In addition to the three brewers above, A-B has also purchased Blue Point Brewing, 10 Barrel Brewing, Devil's Backbone Brewing, Four Peaks Brewing, Camden Town Brewery, Breckenridge Brewery, and most recently, Wicked Weed Brewing. It also started its own mass-craft beer Shock Top, picked up a handful of beer distributors, and acquired both Northern Brewer and its sister operation Midwest Supplies.
Home brewing is a fragmented industry, and though it's the biggest, Northern Brewer accounted for just 6% of the industry's approximately $764 million in annual sales. By buying its way into the field, Anheuser-Busch ingratiates itself into the growth end of the beer market, and home brewing is of particular note because it is where many, if not most craft brewers, got their start. Founders of both Elysian and Golden Road began brewing at home.
However, by offering starter kits for its craft beers labels, A-B is closing the loop on the cycle of beer industry growth.
Gotta start somewhere
In a video announcing the availability of a Goose Island Porter starter kit, Northern Brewer makes clear that if you're interested in drinking one of these beers your best bet is traveling to the Chicago market to buy it. That's why this is such a smart move for Anheuser-Busch: beer lovers can't easily get to Goose Island's Chicago taproom or one of Elysian's four restaurants in Washington, but they can brew up a batch in their kitchen.

The megabrewer certainly hopes for something of a halo effect for its other beers when it purchases a craft beer, and by making it more broadly available it introduces more people to it than when it was just a local brand. Because of its size, there are synergies for the craft brewers unavailable if they remained independent. It also allows Anheuser-Busch to make its craft brand cheaper than its small rivals can.
Yet it's a dual-edged sword, because "local" is what's driving the craft-beer market today, and making a label national may backfire. A beer like Karbach Brewing that A-B bought last year is popular in Texas, but may not resonate in Oregon, and the beer drinkers who made the local beers popular feel affronted by the sellout. Wicked Weed Brewing reportedly lost a number of supporters and partners when it agreed to be bought out by Anheuser-Busch.
It's also operationally important for A-B because mass-produced beer sales have been falling steadily, craft remains a growth center, and the home-brew market, as noted, serves as the stepping stone from which craft brewers spring.

Still brewing up trouble
In addition to the three kits from the craft breweries it owns, Anheuser-Busch makes available through Northern Brewer kits from several other brewers, including Dry Dock Brewing, Lakefront Brewery, and Tallgrass Brewing. The difference between the kits, though, is that those from the A-B brand are marketed under the Brewery Edition brand, while the others are called its Pro Series. (Tallgrass did enter a distribution agreement with A-B back in 2009.) 
This blending of craft beer into the home-brew market is likely to raise more hackles on the necks of some, but investors should consider Anheuser-Busch's savvy in bringing these two lines closer.

From the rooftop patio of his growing brewery in the southwestern elbow of Brooklyn, Shane C. Welch, the founder and “chief visionary” of Sixpoint Brewery, appeared to have staked a nice corner of an intensely competitive beer market.But the constant worry of being crowded out by the big brands, like Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, intensified this month when it was revealed that ZX Ventures, an incubator operated by A.B.I., had purchased a minority stake in a popular beer review website, RateBeer.com.For smaller breweries like Sixpoint, RateBeer had become an invaluable barometer for the marketability of their products, reaching a global audience of like-minded enthusiasts. There they could promote new items or events, follow trends and interact with customers in forums.Now, Mr. Welch worries that the playing field has shifted.“It purports to be an objective, consumer-driven site,” Mr. Welch said. “But there is a massive conflict of interest.”

Mr. Welch joined Sam Calagione, the founder and president of the Dogfish Head brewery in Delaware, in asking that RateBeer promptly remove the reviews and ratings of their beers from its website. As of Friday, RateBeer had not complied. Continue reading the main story

Their concerns, echoed by other independent brewers, ranged from whether individual ratings will truly be independent, to the potential for favoritism in the placement of reviews on the site, to the lack of transparency about the deal, which was consummated in October but was only recently made public.In a telephone interview, Pedro Earp, the chief disruptive growth officer for ZX Ventures, insisted that RateBeer would maintain its independence, recognizing that “the whole success is going to depend on the credibility of the platform.”As far as transparency, Mr. Earp said ZX Ventures typically did not disclose its investments.“In hindsight, we should have anticipated the controversy around that acquisition,” he said. “We should have been more upfront in addressing that concern.”A Pew Research Center survey in December found that 82 percent of adults read online customer ratings or reviews before purchasing a product for the first time. Yakov Bart, assistant professor of marketing at Northeastern University, said the platforms that provide these reviews had exploded in influence for businesses.“It’s better than advertising,” Dr. Bart said. “Not only is it free, but consumers trust it more than regular communications coming from firms or businesses.”But he added, “One can have doubts whether consumers are going to trust the platform after they realize it’s been acquired by a large brand.”The lack of transparency could become problematic for A.B.I. if it does not quickly address its ownership arrangement so consumers can recognize it, said Marc Edelman, a professor of law at Baruch College’s School of Business.

“One could make a reasonable argument that failing to disclose that information might constitute some form of misrepresentation,” Mr. Edelman said.He added, though, that Sixpoint and Dogfish Head would have a hard time forcing RateBeer to remove its reviews until they could prove that their products were somehow being wronged.

When reached by phone, Mr. Calagione said his unease had to be viewed in context. Last fall, A.B.I., which owns Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, among hundreds of other labels, bought Northern Brewer, one of the largest home-brewing supply businesses. More recently, A.B.I. added its 10th craft brewery, Wicked Weed, to its portfolio, in the same month it was reported that it might be squeezing out other breweries from access to hop farms in South Africa. (A.B.I. said the issue had more to do with low hop yields in the country this year.)Now, with the RateBeer purchase, competitors say they worry that A.B.I. could potentially have access to customer data, which could give it a competitive advantage. However, it is unclear whether A.B.I. will have access to the site’s data.Joe Tucker, the site’s executive director, said in an email that the site was an open platform and that it could not simply remove certain beers or breweries from review.“RateBeer’s community is derived of beer lovers who appreciate the service we offer,” Mr. Tucker said. “Nothing about this investment changes who we are and what we provide. We will just be able to give our community of beer drinkers an even better experience.”Still, when Mr. Calagione’s vice president of marketing, Neal Stewart, posted a statement on the Dogfish Head page on RateBeer explaining why the company wanted its reviews removed from the site, the statement was deleted the next day.Mr. Tucker first chalked it up to a misunderstanding, owing to vandalism that the site had experienced in recent days.“Our solution was to temporarily remove editing powers to brewers and restore all pages affected,” he said. “It wasn’t our intention to limit Dogfish Head’s ability to communicate freely with our audience.”

Later, however, Mr. Tucker sent another email altering his explanation.“The brewery pages are not the place for this discussion,” he wrote, “and per our terms of use, the message was removed.”Dan Kenary, the founder and chief executive of Harpoon Brewery, has also been critical of RateBeer’s new ownership situation. His main concern is that A.B.I. could pressure RateBeer to put its products front and center on the site, influencing a browser in the beer aisle who pulls out a phone to check reviews.“They could do it in ways that consumers wouldn’t even know how their decisions are being influenced,” Mr. Kenary said. “It’s all about transparency and authenticity — show enough respect to consumers to disclose this information.”Like Mr. Calagione, he has taken stock of the industry landscape and believes it is important to speak out.“If we don’t do it, nobody else is going to do it,” Mr. Kenary said. “This market that is incredibly fun and vibrant, where we’ve seen 5,300 breweries sprout up across the country, is at some risk. Over time, because of these big breweries’ size and control of distribution, you will see choice starting to go away. That is what we’re fighting for.”

        Keurig and AB InBev team up on in-home booze maker 

        by Jackie Wattles   @jackiewattles   January 6, 2017: 6:45 PM ET                  
Keurig and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) are teaming up to build an in-home booze brewer.  The companies said Friday that they're launching a joint venture. The plan is to create an appliance that can churn out "beer, spirits, cocktails and mixers" at home, according to a press release.   
  The companies are still researching the product, so there isn't even a prototype yet, much less any other details. But an Anheuser-Busch partnership may mean that it can create home-brewed versions of beers such as Budweiser and Corona.   Keurig is best known for its single-cup coffee maker. But the new appliance will use the technology from its now-defunct cold beverage maker, the Keurig Kold, which was supposed to compete with SodaStream (SODA).   Related: Amazon worth more than Sears, Macy's and Target combined     Keurig desperately needs a hit product. It was acquired in 2015 for $13.9 billion by JAB Holding, which is privately held, after the company's stock price slid 70% in one year thanks to a massive sales slump.   The Kold, Keurig's latest product launch, was a major flop. The company stopped making them in June last year after just 10 months of production, and even doled out refunds to customers who purchased the product, which retailed for a whopping $370.   Related: Sears sells Craftsman to Stanley Black & Decker   SodaStream also beat Keurig to the punch with making in-home beer brewers. The company began selling the SodaStream Beer Bar in a couple of European markets last May, and it's introducing the product to more countries throughout 2017.

 Anheuser-Busch InBev: The 'Berkshire Of Beer' With A 3.4% Dividend Yield - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Anheuser-Busch InBev: The 'Berkshire Of Beer' With A 3.4% Dividend YieldApr.12.17 | About: Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) Sure Dividend Long-term horizon, newsletter provider, dividend investing, High Quality DividendsSure Dividend (High Quality Dividend Growth Stocks) Written by Bob Ciura on April 12th, 2017, for Sure Dividend. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is a case study for how to successfully grow through acquisitions. AB-InBev was formed through the combination of InBev and Anheuser-Busch, in 2008. In 2009, the company launched its U.S.-listed shares. Since then, AB-InBev has embarked on a number of transformative, multi-billion M&A deals. In this way, it has followed a similar path as Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B). The result is that AB-InBev is now a global beer behemoth. It generates high profit margins, which allows the company to reward shareholders with a hefty dividend. With that said, it is not yet a member of the Dividend Achievers, a group of 265 stocks that have raised their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years. You can see the full Dividend Achievers List here. But AB-InBev does have a solid 3.4% dividend yield. This article will discuss why AB-InBev is an attractive stock for dividend income and growth. Business Overview AB-InBev is the world’s largest brewer and sells its beer in more than 150 countries worldwide. It has a massive product portfolio, with more than 500 brands. Just a few of its most popular brands include:  Budweiser Bud Light Corona Stella Artois Beck’s Castle Skol  And there are many more. In all, AB-InBev has 18 individual brands that each generate $1 billion or more in annual sales. The company has a global reach. Approximately 64% of its EBITDA comes from outside North America. 

 Source: 2016 Annual Report, page 4 AB-InBev has amassed such a huge brand portfolio through various mergers and acquisitions. It was first organized through the $52 billion merger of three separate brewing companies in 2008—Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the U.S. In 2013, AB-InBev acquired the remaining portion of Grupo Modelo that it didn’t already own, for $20.1 billion. The deal gave AB-InBev full ownership of the crown jewel Corona, which is one of the company’s highest-growth brands today. Last year, AB-InBev acquired SABMiller for just over $100 billion. The result is that AB-InBev is a global powerhouse. It generated $46 billion of sales and $16.4 billion of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) last year alone. Growth Prospects At its core, AB-InBev’s growth strategy is to make huge acquisitions of companies with strong brands and leadership positions in their respective categories. This gave AB-InBev high-quality brands, which provide it with the ability to raise prices over time. As a result of its acquisition spree, AB-InBev’s flagship brands are Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Corona. These brands dominate their respective home markets: the U.S., Europe, and Mexico. 

 Source: 2016 Earnings Presentation, page 7 The “big three” brands allow for the greatest pricing power. The three brands collectively grew revenue by 6.5% in 2016. Each brand generated strong growth last year, with Corona leading the way at 14% growth. In addition, big acquisitions provide AB-InBev with scale. It can easily leverage its global distribution, and squeeze out huge cost synergies to boost profit margins. For example, last year AB-InBev’s U.S. business delivered its seventh consecutive year of profit margin growth. Segment EBITDA rose 2.2% to $5.6 billion, as profit margin expanded 84 basis points to 40.1%. Going forward, AB-InBev expects to cut nearly $2 billion from its cost structure over the next three to four years, as a result of its SABMiller deal. 

 Source: 2016 Earnings Presentation, page 5 It is highly likely that AB-InBev will continue its strategy of conducting enormous M&A deals. There have even been reports that AB-InBev could try to acquire Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). In essence, AB-InBev’s growth strategy can be summed up as, "if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it." AB-InBev has been so successful growing revenue and EBITDA with acquisitions and cost-cutting that there is little reason why the company would not go after another $100+ billion "megadeal." The next huge merger could be into another industry altogether, such as soft drinks or food, to provide AB-InBev with diversification. Competitive Advantages & Recession Performance The beer industry is a highly competitive business. Consumption of beer has flat-lined in the U.S. As a result, growth largely comes from taking market share from competitors. The rise of smaller, craft breweries over the past several years would normally be a significant competitive threat for an industry goliath like AB-InBev. However, AB-InBev simply uses its deep pockets to buy smaller, fast-growing competitors. In recent years, AB-InBev has purchased several craft brewers, including Goose Island, Blue Point, Elysian, and Golden Road, Karbach, and Devils Backbone. Deep pockets are one of AB-InBev’s many competitive advantages, which have fueled its growth over the years. Another is its strong brand portfolio. AB-InBev has a huge global beer portfolio, and owns seven of the 10 most valuable beer brands in the world, according to market research firm BrandZ. This includes Budweiser, the most valuable beer brand in the world. The combination of strong brands and a lean cost structure serves AB-InBev well when economic conditions deteriorate. It is further aided by its business model. Beer is a very recession-resistant product. These qualities helped the company remain highly profitable, even during the Great Recession:  2007 earnings-per-share of $2.24 2008 earnings-per-share of $1.93 2009 earnings-per-share of $2.90 2010 earnings-per-share of $3.13  AB-InBev saw earnings per share decline 14% in 2008, but enjoyed a quick recovery. Valuation & Expected Total Returns Last year was a difficult one for AB-InBev. Overall earnings per share fell 46%, but approximately 80% of the decline was due to non-recurring items, mostly pertaining to the SABMiller deal. In addition, negative currency impacts shaved $0.60 per share off of full-year earnings. Excluding all these factors, organic earnings per share actually increased 2% for the year. Using fiscal 2016 earnings-per-share before unusual items of $4.70, AB-InBev stock trades for a price-to-earnings ratio of 23.5. This is slightly below the average S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio of 26. As a result, the stock is modestly undervalued. Going forward, total returns will be comprised of earnings growth and dividends. A reasonable breakdown of future returns is as follows:  4%-6% organic revenue growth 1% earnings growth from margin expansion 1% earnings growth from share repurchases 3.4% dividend yield  As a result, total returns could reach approximately 9.4%-11.4% per year. AB-InBev pays a semiannual dividend, in Euros. Last year, it paid a total annual dividend of approximately $3.81 per share in U.S. dollars, using the current exchange rates. 

 Source: 2016 Earnings Presentation, page 32 Its total dividend was unchanged from the previous year, but AB-InBev has consistently raised its dividend since the Great Recession. Based on its recent share price, AB-InBev shares have a 3.4% dividend yield. This is an attractive yield, at roughly 140 basis points above the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index. Final Thoughts The current environment is challenging for AB-InBev. The strong U.S. dollar, and deteriorating economic conditions in Brazil, are hurting the company. As is, the pervasive competitive threat from craft breweries. However, AB-InBev continues to grow revenue and earnings. Its growth strategy is to make huge acquisitions, drastically cut costs, and repeat the process over and over again. And its 3.4% dividend yield makes it an attractive stock selection for income investors.

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is the largest beer company in the world. It had 200 brands prior to the merger with SABMiller on October 10, 2016.[1] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[2][3]
The original InBev global brands are Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois. Its international brands are Beck's, Hoegaarden and Leffe. The rest are categorized as local brands. Many other brands were gained as a result of the merger with SABMiller.
