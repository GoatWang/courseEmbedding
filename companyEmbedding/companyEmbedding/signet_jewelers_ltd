Signet Jewelers Ltd. (Ratner Group 1949-1993 then Signet Group plc to September 2008) is the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry.[1] The company is domiciled in Bermuda and headquartered in Akron, Ohio, and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 14th march 2016 the company has been delisted from the London Stock Exchange, following reports that less than 1% of their annual trading volume was conducted via the platform.[2] The group operates in the middle market jewelry segment and has number one positions in the U.S., Canada and UK speciality jewelry markets. Certain brands (Jared in the U.S. and H Samuel/Ernest Jones/Leslie Davis in the UK) operate in the upper middle market.[1] Signet Jewelers owns and operates the companies Zale, Kay Jewelers, and Jared.[3]

History[edit]
The group was founded in 1949 and grew organically before expanding rapidly through a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was formerly known as the Ratner Group.
Gerald Ratner who built it from 130 stores to 2500, a previous CEO, made possibly the most famous gaffe in twentieth century British business when he explained to a major business conference that the reason why one of his products was so cheap was that it was "total crap". He then went on to unfavourably compare some of the company's earrings with a 99p prawn sandwich. His remarks were gleefully reported by the media. The company lost over 500 million pounds off its share price and consumers subsequently avoided the Ratner branded stores, nearly 300 of which were closed between January 1992 and May 1994 as the group went through a financial restructuring. Ratner resigned in November 1992 and the group changed its name to Signet Group plc in September 1993.
This perceived lack of judgement and contempt for the customer gave rise to the expression "doing a Ratner".[4][5]
The company moved its primary stock market listing from the London to the New York Stock Exchange on September 11, 2008, changing its name to Signet Jewelers Limited in the process.[6] The firm also moved its country of domicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda on the same day,[7] although it retains headquarters in Akron, OH.[1]
In February 2014, Signet Jewelers Ltd. agreed to buy Zale Corporation, with Zale shareholders receiving USD$21 a share in cash in USD$1.4 billion deal.[8] This merger has created a $6.2 billion firm.[8]
Operations[edit]
Signet operates approximately 5,000 stores.[1]
Litigation[edit]
Signet Jewelers Ltd. is subject to at least two class actions through its subsidiaries, Sterling Jewelers and Jared The Galleria of Jewelry. It is being sued by 44,000 female employees and former employees for discrimination. The action was launched in 2008 and Sterling is still fighting it 2015.[9]

As of 14th march 2016 the company has been delisted from the London Stock Exchange, following reports that less than 1% of their annual trading volume was conducted via the platform.[2] The group operates in the middle market jewelry segment and has number one positions in the U.S., Canada and UK speciality jewelry markets. Certain brands (Jared in the U.S. and H Samuel/Ernest Jones/Leslie Davis in the UK) operate in the upper middle market.[1] Signet Jewelers owns and operates the companies Zale, Kay Jewelers, and Jared.[3]

History[edit]
The group was founded in 1949 and grew organically before expanding rapidly through a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was formerly known as the Ratner Group.
Gerald Ratner who built it from 130 stores to 2500, a previous CEO, made possibly the most famous gaffe in twentieth century British business when he explained to a major business conference that the reason why one of his products was so cheap was that it was "total crap". He then went on to unfavourably compare some of the company's earrings with a 99p prawn sandwich. His remarks were gleefully reported by the media. The company lost over 500 million pounds off its share price and consumers subsequently avoided the Ratner branded stores, nearly 300 of which were closed between January 1992 and May 1994 as the group went through a financial restructuring. Ratner resigned in November 1992 and the group changed its name to Signet Group plc in September 1993.
This perceived lack of judgement and contempt for the customer gave rise to the expression "doing a Ratner".[4][5]
The company moved its primary stock market listing from the London to the New York Stock Exchange on September 11, 2008, changing its name to Signet Jewelers Limited in the process.[6] The firm also moved its country of domicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda on the same day,[7] although it retains headquarters in Akron, OH.[1]
In February 2014, Signet Jewelers Ltd. agreed to buy Zale Corporation, with Zale shareholders receiving USD$21 a share in cash in USD$1.4 billion deal.[8] This merger has created a $6.2 billion firm.[8]
Operations[edit]
Signet operates approximately 5,000 stores.[1]
Litigation[edit]
Signet Jewelers Ltd. is subject to at least two class actions through its subsidiaries, Sterling Jewelers and Jared The Galleria of Jewelry. It is being sued by 44,000 female employees and former employees for discrimination. The action was launched in 2008 and Sterling is still fighting it 2015.[9]

Signet Jewelers Ltd., the corporate parent of Kay Jewelers and Zales, has lost much of its sparkle in the past couple of years.The company on Monday took an important step toward reclaiming it: naming a new CEO, Virginia C. Drosos. She will replace Mark Light, who had held the top job since 2014, but whose career at Signet spanned more than 35 years. The company said Light is retiring "due to health reasons."The change is a potentially pivotal shake-up for a company that badly needs one.Last year, Signet faced allegations it was systematically swapping diamonds from jewelry brought into its stores for repair, sending customers home with cheaper stones than they had originally purchased. Though the company has strongly denied these claims, the accusations still ping-ponged around social media and likely bruised its reputation.And sworn statements in an arbitration case released earlier this year show Light has been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior toward female employees. This claim was unearthed in a class-action case in which hundreds of former workers said there was a pattern of sexual misconduct at the company. (Signet has denied wrongdoing.)Replacing Light is an effective way for Signet to show employees and investors it wants to move forward and is serious about fixing a troubling workplace culture.It's also an opportunity to bring fresh eyes to a business that clearly needs new direction.

Signet's stock has been slammed this year, partly because investors are likely squeamish about its ability to ride out the scandals. But distress in its core jewelry businesses has contributed, too.

From Bad to Worse

Signet's sales have been battered by several problems. It is saddled with a huge fleet of stores, many of which are in malls where foot traffic is sliding and other tenants are failing or fleeing. The company has said a steady stream of deep discounts by its competitors has put it in a tough spot: Signet can either watch customers flock to rivals offering eye-popping prices, or it can join the fray and watch margins suffer.And the company doesn't exactly have its foot on the gas in its digital business. Sales in that channel rose just 1.1 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, a paltry increase in what should be a high-growth area.Signet's 1Q Online Sales Growth1.1%It is true jewelry is more insulated from the rise of online retailing than, say, clothing or electronics. Engagement-ring shoppers are typically making one of the most personal and high-ticket purchases they'll ever make. It stands to reason many of them want to see the goods in person.But with Blue Nile Inc. aggressively pursuing the digital corner of the market, it is still important for Signet to do more to position itself as a serious player there.It remains to be seen whether Drosos is the right choice to shine up the jewelry behemoth. She has plenty of experience in the consumer sector, having spent more than 25 years at The Procter & Gamble Co. But it is unclear how that résumé will translate into selling bling. Peddling pantry staples and personal-care items is more about edging out competition with attractive prices and finding ways to make a habit of buying a given product.Kay, Zales and Signet's other jewelry chains are a very different kind of business. Signet is not a retailing empire built on amassing a base of frequent, regular shoppers, but one that relies heavily on customer service and the creation of an aspirational in-store experience.Still, Drosos has been on Signet's board of directors since 2012, and she has served on its sub-committee focused on customer experience. That should help her hit the ground running. It's a good thing, too, because Signet needs help right away. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Signet Jewelers Ltd. (Ratner Group 1949-1993 then Signet Group plc to September 2008) is the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry.[1] The company is domiciled in Bermuda and headquartered in Akron, Ohio, and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 14th march 2016 the company has been delisted from the London Stock Exchange, following reports that less than 1% of their annual trading volume was conducted via the platform.[2] The group operates in the middle market jewelry segment and has number one positions in the U.S., Canada and UK speciality jewelry markets. Certain brands (Jared in the U.S. and H Samuel/Ernest Jones/Leslie Davis in the UK) operate in the upper middle market.[1] Signet Jewelers owns and operates the companies Zale, Kay Jewelers, and Jared.[3]

History[edit]
The group was founded in 1949 and grew organically before expanding rapidly through a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was formerly known as the Ratner Group.
Gerald Ratner who built it from 130 stores to 2500, a previous CEO, made possibly the most famous gaffe in twentieth century British business when he explained to a major business conference that the reason why one of his products was so cheap was that it was "total crap". He then went on to unfavourably compare some of the company's earrings with a 99p prawn sandwich. His remarks were gleefully reported by the media. The company lost over 500 million pounds off its share price and consumers subsequently avoided the Ratner branded stores, nearly 300 of which were closed between January 1992 and May 1994 as the group went through a financial restructuring. Ratner resigned in November 1992 and the group changed its name to Signet Group plc in September 1993.
This perceived lack of judgement and contempt for the customer gave rise to the expression "doing a Ratner".[4][5]
The company moved its primary stock market listing from the London to the New York Stock Exchange on September 11, 2008, changing its name to Signet Jewelers Limited in the process.[6] The firm also moved its country of domicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda on the same day,[7] although it retains headquarters in Akron, OH.[1]
In February 2014, Signet Jewelers Ltd. agreed to buy Zale Corporation, with Zale shareholders receiving USD$21 a share in cash in USD$1.4 billion deal.[8] This merger has created a $6.2 billion firm.[8]
Operations[edit]
Signet operates approximately 5,000 stores.[1]
Litigation[edit]
Signet Jewelers Ltd. is subject to at least two class actions through its subsidiaries, Sterling Jewelers and Jared The Galleria of Jewelry. It is being sued by 44,000 female employees and former employees for discrimination. The action was launched in 2008 and Sterling is still fighting it 2015.[9]

Signet Jewelers aims to buff its image and names a new CEO

Virginia Drosos takes over at Signet, which lags rivals online and is battling sales declines and reputation challenges.




(Bloomberg Gadfly)—Signet Jewelers Ltd., the corporate parent of Kay Jewelers and Zales, has lost much of its sparkle in the past couple of years.
Virginia Drosos, CEO, Signet Jewelers
The company on Monday took an important step toward reclaiming it: naming a new CEO, Virginia Drosos. She will replace Mark Light, who had held the top job since 2014, but whose career at Signet spanned more than 35 years. The company said Light is retiring July 31 “due to health reasons.”
The change is a potentially pivotal shake-up for a company that badly needs one.
Last year, Signet faced allegations it was systematically swapping diamonds from jewelry brought into its stores for repair, sending customers home with cheaper stones than they had originally purchased. Though the company has strongly denied these claims, the accusations still ping-ponged around social media and likely bruised its reputation. Signet is No. 113 in the Internet Retailer 2017 Top 500.

And sworn statements in an arbitration case released earlier this year show Light has been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior toward female employees. This claim was unearthed in a class-action case in which hundreds of former workers said there was a pattern of sexual misconduct at the company. (Signet has denied wrongdoing.)
Replacing Light is an effective way for Signet to show employees and investors it wants to move forward and is serious about fixing a troubling workplace culture.

Tiffany’s new CEO is tasked with putting the sparkle back in jewelry sales 

Bloomberg News |

It’s also an opportunity to bring fresh eyes to a business that clearly needs new direction.
Signet’s stock has been slammed this year, partly because investors are likely squeamish about its ability to ride out the scandals. But distress in its core jewelry businesses has contributed too.
advertisement



Signet’s sales have been battered by several problems. It is saddled with a huge fleet of stores, many of which are in malls where foot traffic is sliding and other tenants are failing or fleeing. The company has said a steady stream of deep discounts by its competitors has put it in a tough spot: Signet can either watch customers flock to rivals offering eye-popping prices, or it can join the fray and watch margins suffer.
And the company doesn’t exactly have its foot on the gas in its digital business. Sales in that channel rose just 1.1% in the first quarter from a year earlier, a paltry increase in what should be a high-growth area.
It is true jewelry is more insulated from the rise of online retailing than, say, clothing or electronics. Engagement-ring shoppers are typically making one of the most personal and high-ticket purchases they’ll ever make. It stands to reason many of them want to see the goods in person.
But with Blue Nile Inc. (No. 96) aggressively pursuing the digital corner of the market, it is still important for Signet to do more to position itself as a serious player there.
It remains to be seen whether Drosos is the right choice to shine up the jewelry behemoth. She has plenty of experience in the consumer sector, having spent more than 25 years at The Procter & Gamble Co. But it is unclear how that resume will translate into selling bling. Peddling pantry staples and personal-care items is more about edging out competition with attractive prices and finding ways to make a habit of buying a given product.
advertisement



Kay, Zales and Signet’s other jewelry chains are a very different kind of business. Signet is not a retailing empire built on amassing a base of frequent, regular shoppers, but one that relies heavily on customer service and the creation of an aspirational in-store experience.
Still, Drosos has been on Signet’s board of directors since 2012, and she has served on its sub-committee focused on customer experience. That should help her hit the ground running. It’s a good thing, too, because Signet needs help right away.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).
