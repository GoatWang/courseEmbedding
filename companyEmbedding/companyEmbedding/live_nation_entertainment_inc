Top 5 FAQs




Schlesinger v. Ticketmaster Class Action Settlement FAQs





Answer:

1. What is this class action settlement
	In 2003, the Schlesinger v. Ticketmaster class action lawsuit was filed, alleging that Ticketmaster failed to fully disclose to consumers all aspects of its UPS and order processing fees. While vigorously defending the lawsuit, Ticketmaster settled the case in 2013, with the court granting final approval of the settlement in February 2015.


	The settlement class generally includes all consumers who purchased tickets on Ticketmaster.com between October 21, 1999, and February 27, 2013 (the “class period”).


2. Why do I have discount codes and ticket vouchers
	As part of the Schlesinger v. Ticketmaster settlement, Ticketmaster agreed to provide:




			To each class member, one discount code (worth $2.25 off a future purchase of primary tickets) for every purchase made on Ticketmaster.com during the class period, up to 17 discount codes per person.
			 
		

			To class members who used UPS delivery during the class period, one $5 UPS discount code for every purchase made on Ticketmaster.com that included UPS delivery, again up to 17 UPS discount codes per person.
			 
		

			To each class member, one ticket voucher (potentially redeemable for two eligible general admission tickets for select events at Live Nation owned or operated venues, subject to availability and limitations) for every purchase on Ticketmaster.com during the class period, up to 17 vouchers per person. The Settlement Agreement limits the value of vouchers that are to be redeemed in a given year. Please be aware that due to high demand and limited availability, we expect these tickets to be redeemed quickly.
		



3. How many codes and vouchers do I get?



		Each class member received one discount code for each Ticketmaster.com purchase made during the class period, up to a maximum of 17 discount codes.
		 
	

		Each class member who used UPS delivery for a ticket order during the class period also received one UPS discount code for each UPS delivery he or she paid for over the class period, up to a maximum of 17 UPS discount codes.
		 
	

		Each class member also received one ticket voucher for each Ticketmaster.com purchase the class member made during the class period, up to a maximum of 17 ticket vouchers. This voucher is potentially redeemable for two eligible general admission tickets for select events at Live Nation owned or operated venues, subject to availability and limitations. The Settlement Agreement limits the value of vouchers that are to be redeemed in a given year. Please be aware that due to high demand and limited availability, we expect these tickets to be redeemed quickly.
	


4. Where do I find my discount codes and ticket vouchers?
	Your discount codes, UPS discount codes, and ticket vouchers are made available to you under the “Active Vouchers” link in your Ticketmaster account at https://www.ticketmaster.com/member/vouchers.


	If you have lost or misplaced your Ticketmaster login name and/or password, please use the “Forgot password?” link to reset your password from https://www.ticketmaster.com/member/.


5. Can I redeem my ticket vouchers for any event on Ticketmaster.com or LiveNation.com?
	Per the Settlement Agreement, class members will receive ticket vouchers that may potentially be redeemed for eligible general admission concert tickets at designated Live Nation owned or operated venues, subject to availability and limitations. Additionally, at Live Nation’s discretion, the events selected may also include Live Nation clubs such as the House of Blues. It is not contemplated by the settlement that Live Nation will make available any tickets for concerts that it promotes in third party buildings, including arenas and stadiums.


6. Where can I find events to use my ticket vouchers?
	You can find eligible events here: http://settlement.livenation.com. The eligible event list will include select events at Live Nation owned or operated venues, subject to availability and limitations.


7. Are the ticket vouchers redeemable for any ticket?
	No. The vouchers are potentially redeemable for two eligible general admission tickets for select events held at Live Nation owned or operated venues, subject to availability and limitations. You can find eligible events here: http://settlement.livenation.com


8. Am I guaranteed tickets to eligible events using my ticket vouchers?
	No. While all class members’ ticket vouchers are eligible for redemption for qualified events, ticket vouchers will be redeemed on a first come, first served basis. Please be aware that due to high demand and limited availability, we expect these tickets to be redeemed quickly.


9. Can I apply the discount codes or ticket vouchers to a previously placed order?
	No. You cannot use your discount codes, UPS discount codes, or ticket vouchers for previously placed orders.


10. Can I combine the codes and ticket vouchers together?



		You can combine up to two discount codes per transaction ($4.50 total).
	

		If you elect UPS delivery, you can combine up to two discount codes ($4.50 total) and up to two UPS discount codes ($10.00 total) per transaction (for a total discount of $14.50).
	

		Ticket vouchers cannot be used with any other discount or UPS codes.
	


11. Can I transfer my codes or vouchers to someone else?
	No. Discount codes, UPS discount codes, and ticket vouchers can only be redeemed by the class member. They are non-transferable.


12. How do I know if I qualify for a ticket voucher?
	Please email ticketfeelitigation@gcginc.com.


13. Where do I apply my discount codes?
	To redeem your $2.25 discount code or $5.00 UPS discount codes, log on to www.ticketmaster.com using your Ticketmaster username and password from your desktop or laptop.  Enter the code(s) you would like to use in the applicable area on the billing page. Please note that discount codes may not be redeemed via mobile or mobile apps.  For step by step instructions, check out more info at http://settlement.livenation.com.


14.  Where do I apply my ticket vouchers?
	To redeem your ticket vouchers, log onto www.ticketmaster.com using your Ticketmaster username and password from your desktop or laptop and find your ticket vouchers, then click here. Note that voucher redemption is only available for events that are linked from this page.  Once you select an event, click the “Redeem” button.  On the billing page, look for a “voucher code” link and enter your code to receive your discount(s). Please note that ticket vouchers may not be redeemed via mobile or mobile apps.   For step by step instructions, check out more info at http://settlement.livenation.com.


15. Can I use the mobile app or mobile web to redeem my discount codes or vouchers?
	Discount codes, UPS codes, and ticket vouchers cannot be redeemed on the mobile website or the mobile app.  See FAQs 13 and 14 for information on how to redeem your discount codes and ticket vouchers on your desktop or laptop.


16. I think I should have more discount codes and ticket vouchers than I see in my account. What should I do?
	Please email ticketfeelitigation@gcginc.com.


17. Can my ticket voucher be used more than once if I only used it for one ticket?
	No. Each ticket voucher can only be used once, and then it will no longer be valid and it will no longer be viewable in your account.


18. Why are there no events in my area?
	Per the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Ticketmaster will provide tickets across a variety of events that take place only at Live Nation owned or operated venues. The Settlement Agreement limits the value of vouchers that are to be redeemed in a given year. Please be aware that due to high demand and limited availability, we expect these tickets to be redeemed quickly.  If the current list of events does not include an event in your area, please check back periodically, as new events may be added.


19. Are wheelchair accessible seats available for ticket voucher redemption?
	Yes. Eligible general admission tickets available for ticket voucher redemption are wheelchair accessible. Please redeem your voucher for your selected event.  The venue will accommodate your accessible needs at the event.


20. Why can I only redeem my ticket voucher for these events?
	Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, ticket vouchers can only be redeemed for eligible events at Live Nation owned or operated venues in the U.S. on a first come, first served basis. Please continue to check back, as more events may be added periodically. For an updated list of eligible events, visit http://settlement.livenation.com.


21. When will my discount codes and ticket vouchers expire?



		Your discount codes and UPS discount codes will expire on June 18, 2020.
	



		Your ticket vouchers will be valid for eligible events (which can be found here: http://settlement.livenation.com) until no further tickets are available for any listed events and/or no further events are posted. Ticket voucher redemption is on a first come, first served basis. The Settlement Agreement limits the value of vouchers that are to be redeemed in a given year. Please be aware that due to high demand and limited availability, we expect these tickets to be redeemed quickly.
	


22. Why will everyone who got a ticket voucher not get a ticket?
	The Settlement Agreement limits the number of tickets that are to be made available for voucher redemption in a given year, and vouchers are redeemable on a first come, first served basis. Please be aware that due to high demand and limited availability, we expect these tickets to be redeemed quickly.


23. Why can’t I use my ticket voucher for every event on LiveNation.com and Ticketmaster.com?
	Per the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Ticketmaster is making tickets available to select concerts at Live Nation owned or operated venues across the United States. Not all events ticketed by Ticketmaster, nor all Live Nation concerts, are eligible for ticket voucher use.


24. How can the ticket vouchers be sold out?
	Ticketmaster provides, per the Settlement Agreement, an allotment of tickets to the eligible events for which tickets may be purchased using vouchers.  Once all tickets available for voucher redemption have been purchased for a particular event, vouchers may no longer be used to purchase tickets for that event.


	The Settlement Agreement limits the value of tickets that are to be redeemed in a given year. Please be aware that due to high demand and limited ticket availability, we expect these tickets to be redeemed quickly.  Check back frequently as additional tickets and/or events may be added periodically.


25. How do I sign up for notifications?
	To sign up to receive an email notification when new tickets are made available for voucher redemption, please visit https://secure.gcginc.com/tkm/SubscriptionSignup.aspx.


26. When are you releasing more tickets?
	Per the Settlement Agreement, Ticketmaster is responsible for making tickets available for ticket voucher redemption based on the value of tickets redeemed using vouchers during the prior year. New tickets may be made available periodically. For the most up-to-date information, please check http://settlement.livenation.com frequently.


	To sign up to receive an email notification when new tickets are made available for voucher redemption, please visit https://secure.gcginc.com/tkm/SubscriptionSignup.aspx.

	You can contact Ticketmaster here: http://www.ticketmaster.com/h/customer-service.html

How do I transfer tickets?





Answer:

	Transferring does not mean to exchange tickets.


	Go to My Account (same one used to purchase) and click the Transfer button on your order. You'll be able to transfer some or all of your tickets.


Desktop Example
Mobile App Example


	Then follow the simple steps and remember, the recipient's email address must be different than the sender's email address. The recipient will need to sign in or create a Ticketmaster account when accepting tickets.


Please Note: Not all events have the Ticket Transfer option. If there is no Transfer button on your order, Ticket Transfer is not available.


Get our app to send tickets from your phone (app is only available in the US and Canada)


	We’ll email you as soon as your friend accepts the tickets, and we’ll email your friend a reminder if they haven’t accepted 48 hours before the event (you can remind them too).


	Once your friend accepts the transfer, trash (or recycle!) your original tickets if you printed them. They’re no longer valid and won’t get you in.


	If you are having difficulty transferring your ticket, Click HERE to Contact Fan Support.

How do I sell tickets?





Answer:

 Just click the Sell button on your order in My Account to start the easy step-by-step: you'll select only the tickets you want to list, set your price, and enter your debit card or checking account info.


Desktop step by step guide


 You can edit or remove your listing anytime, and you'll get paid by direct deposit or pay-by-debit within 7-10 business days after your tickets sell.


 You must have a US bank account to sell tickets for an event in the US.


Not all events or tickets are available for resale. If you don't see a Sell button, selling your tickets though Ticketmaster is not allowed.


 Tickets purchased over the phone with Ticketmaster or through a third party are not available for resale through Ticketmaster Fan-to-Fan Resale.


Please Note: Sometimes the minimum price a ticket can be resold for is the face value of the ticket. This may be restricted by the venue, artist or promoter of the event at their own discretion.

What happens if my event is canceled?





Answer:

	Canceled events are tough, but at least refunds are easy.


	If you bought tickets online or over the phone, you won’t need to do a thing. We’ll let you know the event is canceled and automatically refund your order (except UPS fees) to the same card used for purchase. All refunds should be received within 7-10 business days after we learn the event is canceled.


Note: postponed or rescheduled events are handled differently.

What happens if my event is postponed or rescheduled?





Answer:

 We’ll contact you with the new date and time asap. Your tickets are still good for the new date.


 Can’t make it? The decision to issue refunds for rescheduled events is up to the artist, team, venue, or promoter, but maybe we can help - Contact Fan Support.


 You might be able to get a self-service refund. Go to My Account on your computer (it won’t work on the app) and look for a Refund button on your order. No button? Contact Fan Support.


 Unfortunately, refunds are not available for Fan-to-Fan Resale tickets for rescheduled events. The good news is you can sell your tickets straight from My Account.

Live Nation is an American live-events company based in Beverly Hills, California, focused on worldwide concert and entertainment-show promotions. Live Nation formed in 2005 as a spin-off from Clear Channel Communications, which then merged with Ticketmaster in 2010 to become Live Nation Entertainment.
Live Nation "signs" artists as a "record label", but predominantly takes the role of a promoter, rather than "music owner". The deal with U2 and Madonna, for example, does not include funding of the artists' future recordings. The 2007 deal signed with Jay-Z does, but he still retains full-ownership of his recordings and Live Nation funded Roc Nation.[1][2] Live Nation signed Colombian singer Shakira, Canadian band Nickelback and Mexican singer Luis Miguel.

Business[edit]
A prior incarnation of Live Nation, known as SFX Entertainment, was formed in the 1990s by media executive Robert F. X. Sillerman. Its business model involved the acquisition of regional concert promoters, consolidating them into a single national company. Sillerman sold SFX to Clear Channel Communications in 2000 for $4.4 billion; the Clear Channel Entertainment division was spun off in 2005 to form Live Nation.[3][4][5]
Annually, Live Nation promotes or produces over 22,000 events, including music concerts, with total attendance exceeding 50 million—more than the NBA, NFL, and NHL combined.[6] As of September 30, 2005, Live Nation owned or operated 117 venues, consisting of 75 US and 42 international venues. These venues include 39 amphitheatres, 58 theatres, 14 clubs, 4 arenas and 2 festival sites. In addition, through equity, booking or similar arrangements Live Nation has the right to book events at 33 additional venues.

Deals[edit]
In October 2007, Live Nation announced a new contract with pop singer Madonna throughout the next decade after her leaving Warner Music and Warner Bros. She will be the founding recording artist for the new music division Live Nation Artists, formerly Artist Nation. In July 2008, Shakira signed an estimated $70–100 million contract with Live Nation.[36][37][38][39]
In January, 2008, Live Nation sold its North American theatrical business (including the Broadway Across America business) to Key Brand Entertainment for $90.4 million. Key Brand Entertainment is a private investment company owned by British theater producer John Gore and led by senior entertainment industry executive Tom McGrath.[40]
In April 2008, a deal between Jay-Z and Live Nation for $152 million was confirmed. The deal covers financing of Jay-Z's own entertainment venture, live shows, tours and future recordings for the next 10 years.[41] Blueprint 3 was distributed by Atlantic Records, while his label, Roc Nation, is being distributed by Universal Music Group.[42]
In June 2013, Insomniac Events, a promoter focused on electronic dance music, announced a major "creative partnership" with Live Nation, giving the promoter access to Live Nation's resources while remaining an independent company. Live Nation did not take any ownership stake in Insomniac.[43][44]

Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Live Nation are: Ari Emanuel, Jeffrey T. Hinson, L. Lowry Mays, Randall T. Mays, Connie McCombs McNab, James S. Kahan, Ted Enloe, Mark Shapiro, and Michael Rapino.[45]
Live Nation International Music and Live Nation Artists[edit]
Live Nation is currently constructing a physical recording label,[citation needed] Live Nation Artists, which will be a division of Live Nation International Music. The company is expected to become a major rival against Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group with artists such as Madonna, U2, Shakira, Jay-Z and Nickelback.
As of July 30, 2008, CEO Michael Rapino is considering doing licensing deals on an artist-by-artist basis, a source inside Live Nation said. Under that scenario, Warner Music Group could end up handling the marketing, promotion and distribution of albums by the very acts that defected from it to join Live Nation: Nickelback and Madonna. "Rapino wants to outsource everything," said a second source close to the situation. "He doesn't want to build an infrastructure or carry any overhead." The move is mirrored after the "rent-a-system" model used in Hollywood, whereby one studio produces a movie but licenses all the other functions to another studio that already has a distribution and marketing infrastructure.[46]
Live Nation's talks represented the latest retrenchment from the strategy of former chairman Michael Cohl, who sought to transform the touring giant into a multi-faceted powerhouse, including a record company. News of the potential outsourcing move followed the dismissal of industry veterans Bob Ezrin, Bob Cahill and Bill Hein, all of whom were Artist Nation employees hired by Cohl to create a label infrastructure for Live Nation's newly signed acts. Instead of banking all the upside on album sales, as was once envisioned with these so-called "360 deals," Live Nation would likely collect a less lucrative outsourcing royalty of between 25 percent and 35 percent, based on other industry licensing deals. It would then be responsible for using that money to pay the artist's royalty - a fee that, at the superstar level, can come close to equaling the licensing royalty the company is apt to get from a label.[46]
On 31 March 2008, it was confirmed that Live Nation signed a 12-year deal with U2 worth an estimated $100 million (£70 million).[47] The deal includes Live Nation controlling the band's merchandise, sponsoring and their official website. In a contractual agreement with Live Nation signed in March 2008, the parties agreed that the band would receive $25 million for 1.6 million shares of the company; as of 17 December 2008, those shares were worth only just over $6 million. It was reported on 18 December 2008 that Live Nation, honoring their financial commitment, bought back the shares at a loss of $19 million.[48] The company had intended to recoup the cost of signing U2 with their most recent album, No Line on the Horizon. No Line on the Horizon achieved multi platinum status in the international market and has sold over 5 million albums to date.

Proposed merger[edit]
On February 10, 2009, Live Nation and Ticketmaster Entertainment announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to create a combined entity, to be called Live Nation Entertainment.[51] Ticketmaster's press release said Live Nation produces live concerts in 57 countries.[51]
The proposal has received regulatory approval in Norway and Turkey.[52]
In October 2009, the United Kingdom's Competition Commission provisionally ruled against the merger with Ticketmaster.[53] On December 22, 2009, the Competition Commission decided to clear the proposed merger.[52]
Separate regulatory reviews of the proposal continued in the United States and Canada.[52] The United States Department of Justice approved the merger in 2010 subject to review by a federal judge after a 60-day comment period.[54] A condition of the approval, Ticketmaster agreed to license its software to rival Anschutz Entertainment Group, and to sell its subsidiary Paciolan to Comcast Spectacor, Comcast's sporting events subsidiary.[54] The company also agreed not to interfere with competition for the ten year life of the agreement.[54]
Criticism[edit]
Bruce Springsteen said "...the one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing".[55]
In a January 25, 2010 press release, the TicketDisaster.org group—a coalition of consumer rights and anti-trust groups—also issued the following statement about the proposed Live Nation-TicketMaster merger:

"Despite its "monopoly-like dominance" controlling 70 to 80 percent of all concert ticket sales, Ticketmaster is unabashedly seeking to grow its empire - all to the detriment of the average fan. Ticketmaster is now trying to dampen competition by merging with Live Nation, the nation's largest concert promoter and second largest primary ticket seller. That merger is coming under heavy fire from consumer and industry groups and Members of Congress, particularly because of the clear anti-consumer and anti-competitive effects.

"As the Department of Justice reaches the final round of reviewing this merger, only one question must be answered: will the merger lead to increased prices, poorer service, or less innovation?"

Live Nation is an American live-events company based in Beverly Hills, California, focused on worldwide concert and entertainment-show promotions. Live Nation formed in 2005 as a spin-off from Clear Channel Communications, which then merged with Ticketmaster in 2010 to become Live Nation Entertainment.
Live Nation "signs" artists as a "record label", but predominantly takes the role of a promoter, rather than "music owner". The deal with U2 and Madonna, for example, does not include funding of the artists' future recordings. The 2007 deal signed with Jay-Z does, but he still retains full-ownership of his recordings and Live Nation funded Roc Nation.[1][2] Live Nation signed Colombian singer Shakira, Canadian band Nickelback and Mexican singer Luis Miguel.

Business[edit]
A prior incarnation of Live Nation, known as SFX Entertainment, was formed in the 1990s by media executive Robert F. X. Sillerman. Its business model involved the acquisition of regional concert promoters, consolidating them into a single national company. Sillerman sold SFX to Clear Channel Communications in 2000 for $4.4 billion; the Clear Channel Entertainment division was spun off in 2005 to form Live Nation.[3][4][5]
Annually, Live Nation promotes or produces over 22,000 events, including music concerts, with total attendance exceeding 50 million—more than the NBA, NFL, and NHL combined.[6] As of September 30, 2005, Live Nation owned or operated 117 venues, consisting of 75 US and 42 international venues. These venues include 39 amphitheatres, 58 theatres, 14 clubs, 4 arenas and 2 festival sites. In addition, through equity, booking or similar arrangements Live Nation has the right to book events at 33 additional venues.

Deals[edit]
In October 2007, Live Nation announced a new contract with pop singer Madonna throughout the next decade after her leaving Warner Music and Warner Bros. She will be the founding recording artist for the new music division Live Nation Artists, formerly Artist Nation. In July 2008, Shakira signed an estimated $70–100 million contract with Live Nation.[36][37][38][39]
In January, 2008, Live Nation sold its North American theatrical business (including the Broadway Across America business) to Key Brand Entertainment for $90.4 million. Key Brand Entertainment is a private investment company owned by British theater producer John Gore and led by senior entertainment industry executive Tom McGrath.[40]
In April 2008, a deal between Jay-Z and Live Nation for $152 million was confirmed. The deal covers financing of Jay-Z's own entertainment venture, live shows, tours and future recordings for the next 10 years.[41] Blueprint 3 was distributed by Atlantic Records, while his label, Roc Nation, is being distributed by Universal Music Group.[42]
In June 2013, Insomniac Events, a promoter focused on electronic dance music, announced a major "creative partnership" with Live Nation, giving the promoter access to Live Nation's resources while remaining an independent company. Live Nation did not take any ownership stake in Insomniac.[43][44]
In July 2016, a deal between and Live Nation/Roc Nation with Rj Nation Entertainment World Wide based in Austin, Texas]]

Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Live Nation are: Ari Emanuel, Jeffrey T. Hinson, L. Lowry Mays, Randall T. Mays, Connie McCombs McNab, James S. Kahan, Ted Enloe, Mark Shapiro, and Michael Rapino.[45]
Live Nation International Music and Live Nation Artists[edit]
Live Nation is currently constructing a physical recording label,[citation needed] Live Nation Artists, which will be a division of Live Nation International Music. The company is expected to become a major rival against Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group with artists such as Madonna, U2, Shakira, Jay-Z and Nickelback.
As of July 30, 2008, CEO Michael Rapino is considering doing licensing deals on an artist-by-artist basis, a source inside Live Nation said. Under that scenario, Warner Music Group could end up handling the marketing, promotion and distribution of albums by the very acts that defected from it to join Live Nation: Nickelback and Madonna. "Rapino wants to outsource everything," said a second source close to the situation. "He doesn't want to build an infrastructure or carry any overhead." The move is mirrored after the "rent-a-system" model used in Hollywood, whereby one studio produces a movie but licenses all the other functions to another studio that already has a distribution and marketing infrastructure.[46]
Live Nation's talks represented the latest retrenchment from the strategy of former chairman Michael Cohl, who sought to transform the touring giant into a multi-faceted powerhouse, including a record company. News of the potential outsourcing move followed the dismissal of industry veterans Bob Ezrin, Bob Cahill and Bill Hein, all of whom were Artist Nation employees hired by Cohl to create a label infrastructure for Live Nation's newly signed acts. Instead of banking all the upside on album sales, as was once envisioned with these so-called "360 deals," Live Nation would likely collect a less lucrative outsourcing royalty of between 25 percent and 35 percent, based on other industry licensing deals. It would then be responsible for using that money to pay the artist's royalty - a fee that, at the superstar level, can come close to equaling the licensing royalty the company is apt to get from a label.[46]
On 31 March 2008, it was confirmed that Live Nation signed a 12-year deal with U2 worth an estimated $100 million (£70 million).[47] The deal includes Live Nation controlling the band's merchandise, sponsoring and their official website. In a contractual agreement with Live Nation signed in March 2008, the parties agreed that the band would receive $25 million for 1.6 million shares of the company; as of 17 December 2008, those shares were worth only just over $6 million. It was reported on 18 December 2008 that Live Nation, honoring their financial commitment, bought back the shares at a loss of $19 million.[48] The company had intended to recoup the cost of signing U2 with their most recent album, No Line on the Horizon. No Line on the Horizon achieved multi platinum status in the international market and has sold over 5 million albums to date.

Proposed merger[edit]
On February 10, 2009, Live Nation and Ticketmaster Entertainment announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to create a combined entity, to be called Live Nation Entertainment.[51] Ticketmaster's press release said Live Nation produces live concerts in 57 countries.[51]
The proposal has received regulatory approval in Norway and Turkey.[52]
In October 2009, the United Kingdom's Competition Commission provisionally ruled against the merger with Ticketmaster.[53] On December 22, 2009, the Competition Commission decided to clear the proposed merger.[52]
Separate regulatory reviews of the proposal continued in the United States and Canada.[52] The United States Department of Justice approved the merger in 2010 subject to review by a federal judge after a 60-day comment period.[54] A condition of the approval, Ticketmaster agreed to license its software to rival Anschutz Entertainment Group, and to sell its subsidiary Paciolan to Comcast Spectacor, Comcast's sporting events subsidiary.[54] The company also agreed not to interfere with competition for the ten year life of the agreement.[54]
Criticism[edit]
Bruce Springsteen said "...the one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing".[55]
In a January 25, 2010 press release, the TicketDisaster.org group—a coalition of consumer rights and anti-trust groups—also issued the following statement about the proposed Live Nation-TicketMaster merger:

"Despite its "monopoly-like dominance" controlling 70 to 80 percent of all concert ticket sales, Ticketmaster is unabashedly seeking to grow its empire - all to the detriment of the average fan. Ticketmaster is now trying to dampen competition by merging with Live Nation, the nation's largest concert promoter and second largest primary ticket seller. That merger is coming under heavy fire from consumer and industry groups and Members of Congress, particularly because of the clear anti-consumer and anti-competitive effects.

"As the Department of Justice reaches the final round of reviewing this merger, only one question must be answered: will the merger lead to increased prices, poorer service, or less innovation?"

Live Nation is an American live-events company based in Beverly Hills, California, focused on worldwide concert and entertainment-show promotions. Live Nation formed in 2005 as a spin-off from Clear Channel Communications, which then merged with Ticketmaster in 2010 to become Live Nation Entertainment.
Live Nation "signs" artists as a "record label", but predominantly takes the role of a promoter, rather than "music owner". The deal with U2 and Madonna, for example, does not include funding of the artists' future recordings. The 2007 deal signed with Jay-Z does, but he still retains full-ownership of his recordings and Live Nation funded Roc Nation.[1][2] Live Nation signed Colombian singer Shakira, Canadian band Nickelback and Mexican singer Luis Miguel.

Business[edit]
A prior incarnation of Live Nation, known as SFX Entertainment, was formed in the 1990s by media executive Robert F. X. Sillerman. Its business model involved the acquisition of regional concert promoters, consolidating them into a single national company. Sillerman sold SFX to Clear Channel Communications in 2000 for $4.4 billion; the Clear Channel Entertainment division was spun off in 2005 to form Live Nation.[3][4][5]
Annually, Live Nation promotes or produces over 22,000 events, including music concerts, with total attendance exceeding 50 million—more than the NBA, NFL, and NHL combined.[6] As of September 30, 2005, Live Nation owned or operated 117 venues, consisting of 75 US and 42 international venues. These venues include 39 amphitheatres, 58 theatres, 14 clubs, 4 arenas and 2 festival sites. In addition, through equity, booking or similar arrangements Live Nation has the right to book events at 33 additional venues.

Deals[edit]
In October 2007, Live Nation announced a new contract with pop singer Madonna throughout the next decade after her leaving Warner Music and Warner Bros. She will be the founding recording artist for the new music division Live Nation Artists, formerly Artist Nation. In July 2008, Shakira signed an estimated $70–100 million contract with Live Nation.[36][37][38][39]
In January, 2008, Live Nation sold its North American theatrical business (including the Broadway Across America business) to Key Brand Entertainment for $90.4 million. Key Brand Entertainment is a private investment company owned by British theater producer John Gore and led by senior entertainment industry executive Tom McGrath.[40]
In April 2008, a deal between Jay-Z and Live Nation for $152 million was confirmed. The deal covers financing of Jay-Z's own entertainment venture, live shows, tours and future recordings for the next 10 years.[41] Blueprint 3 was distributed by Atlantic Records, while his label, Roc Nation, is being distributed by Universal Music Group.[42]
In June 2013, Insomniac Events, a promoter focused on electronic dance music, announced a major "creative partnership" with Live Nation, giving the promoter access to Live Nation's resources while remaining an independent company. Live Nation did not take any ownership stake in Insomniac.[43][44]
In July 2016, a deal between and Live Nation/Roc Nation with Rj Nation Entertainment World Wide based in Austin, Texas]]
House of Blues[edit]
In 2006 Live Nation acquired House of Blues. Current locations of the House of Blues include:

Myrtle Beach, South Carolina
Dallas, Texas
Houston, Texas (in the Houston Pavilions) (opened October 2008)
San Antonio, Texas (in the Aztec Theatre) (opened not too long ago)[when?]


Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Live Nation are: Ari Emanuel, Jeffrey T. Hinson, L. Lowry Mays, Randall T. Mays, Connie McCombs McNab, James S. Kahan, Ted Enloe, Mark Shapiro, and Michael Rapino.[45]
Live Nation International Music and Live Nation Artists[edit]
Live Nation is currently constructing a physical recording label,[citation needed] Live Nation Artists, which will be a division of Live Nation International Music. The company is expected to become a major rival against Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group with artists such as Madonna, U2, Shakira, Jay-Z and Nickelback.
As of July 30, 2008, CEO Michael Rapino is considering doing licensing deals on an artist-by-artist basis, a source inside Live Nation said. Under that scenario, Warner Music Group could end up handling the marketing, promotion and distribution of albums by the very acts that defected from it to join Live Nation: Nickelback and Madonna. "Rapino wants to outsource everything," said a second source close to the situation. "He doesn't want to build an infrastructure or carry any overhead." The move is mirrored after the "rent-a-system" model used in Hollywood, whereby one studio produces a movie but licenses all the other functions to another studio that already has a distribution and marketing infrastructure.[46]
Live Nation's talks represented the latest retrenchment from the strategy of former chairman Michael Cohl, who sought to transform the touring giant into a multi-faceted powerhouse, including a record company. News of the potential outsourcing move followed the dismissal of industry veterans Bob Ezrin, Bob Cahill and Bill Hein, all of whom were Artist Nation employees hired by Cohl to create a label infrastructure for Live Nation's newly signed acts. Instead of banking all the upside on album sales, as was once envisioned with these so-called "360 deals," Live Nation would likely collect a less lucrative outsourcing royalty of between 25 percent and 35 percent, based on other industry licensing deals. It would then be responsible for using that money to pay the artist's royalty - a fee that, at the superstar level, can come close to equaling the licensing royalty the company is apt to get from a label.[46]
On 31 March 2008, it was confirmed that Live Nation signed a 12-year deal with U2 worth an estimated $100 million (£70 million).[47] The deal includes Live Nation controlling the band's merchandise, sponsoring and their official website. In a contractual agreement with Live Nation signed in March 2008, the parties agreed that the band would receive $25 million for 1.6 million shares of the company; as of 17 December 2008, those shares were worth only just over $6 million. It was reported on 18 December 2008 that Live Nation, honoring their financial commitment, bought back the shares at a loss of $19 million.[48] The company had intended to recoup the cost of signing U2 with their most recent album, No Line on the Horizon. No Line on the Horizon achieved multi platinum status in the international market and has sold over 5 million albums to date.

Proposed merger[edit]
On February 10, 2009, Live Nation and Ticketmaster Entertainment announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to create a combined entity, to be called Live Nation Entertainment.[51] Ticketmaster's press release said Live Nation produces live concerts in 57 countries.[51]
The proposal has received regulatory approval in Norway and Turkey.[52]
In October 2009, the United Kingdom's Competition Commission provisionally ruled against the merger with Ticketmaster.[53] On December 22, 2009, the Competition Commission decided to clear the proposed merger.[52]
Separate regulatory reviews of the proposal continued in the United States and Canada.[52] The United States Department of Justice approved the merger in 2010 subject to review by a federal judge after a 60-day comment period.[54] A condition of the approval, Ticketmaster agreed to license its software to rival Anschutz Entertainment Group, and to sell its subsidiary Paciolan to Comcast Spectacor, Comcast's sporting events subsidiary.[54] The company also agreed not to interfere with competition for the ten year life of the agreement.[54]
Criticism[edit]
Bruce Springsteen said "...the one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing".[55]
In a January 25, 2010 press release, the TicketDisaster.org group—a coalition of consumer rights and anti-trust groups—also issued the following statement about the proposed Live Nation-TicketMaster merger:

"Despite its "monopoly-like dominance" controlling 70 to 80 percent of all concert ticket sales, Ticketmaster is unabashedly seeking to grow its empire - all to the detriment of the average fan. Ticketmaster is now trying to dampen competition by merging with Live Nation, the nation's largest concert promoter and second largest primary ticket seller. That merger is coming under heavy fire from consumer and industry groups and Members of Congress, particularly because of the clear anti-consumer and anti-competitive effects.

"As the Department of Justice reaches the final round of reviewing this merger, only one question must be answered: will the merger lead to increased prices, poorer service, or less innovation?"

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
