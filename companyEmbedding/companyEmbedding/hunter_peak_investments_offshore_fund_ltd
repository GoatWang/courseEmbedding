Royalty trust

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining. However, unlike most corporations, its profits are not taxed at the corporate level provided a certain high percentage (e.g. 90%) of profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends. The dividends are then taxed as personal income. This system, similar to real estate investment trusts, effectively avoids the double taxation of corporate income.

Characteristics of royalty trusts[edit]
Royalty trusts typically own oil or natural gas wells, the mineral rights of wells, or mineral rights on other types of properties. An outside company must perform the actual operation of the oil or gas field, or mine, and the trust itself, in the United States, may[ambiguous] have no employees. Shares of the trust generally trade on the public stock markets, but the trust itself is typically overseen by a trust officer in a bank.
They are a powerful investment tool for people who wish to invest directly in extraction of petroleum or mining of other materials, but who do not have the resources or risk tolerance to buy their own well or mine. Additionally, since trusts often own numerous individual wells, oil fields, or mines, they represent a convenient way for the average investor to diversify investments across a number of properties. Also, since commodities are considered a hedge against inflation, the popularity of royalty trusts as investments rises as interest rates rise, and their shares often rise as a result.[1]
These trusts often attract investors with their relatively high yields;[2] in 2007, their distributions were often in the 10 to 15 percent annual range. This makes the shares sensitive to interest rates, as share prices are likely to decline in periods of rising interest rates, and to rise when interest rates fall. Additionally, royalty trusts in the United States and Canada usually involve oil and gas fields or mines which are at or past their production peak, and will gradually decline in output as well as revenue; however, the infrastructure to develop them has already been built, so that an investor can expect a reasonably steady income stream.[3]
In addition to allowing investors to achieve high distribution returns, especially during periods of low interest rates, royalty trusts allow investors to speculate directly on commodities such as gas, oil, or iron ore without having to buy futures contracts, or use the other investment vehicles traditionally associated with commodities—since the trusts trade like stocks. During times when a commodity price is rising, the share value as well as the dividend return of a trust engaging in production of that commodity will rise as well.[4]
Canadian royalty trusts (CanRoy)[edit]
Royalty trusts are found mainly in Canada and the United States; there is also one in Germany. Canadian royalty trusts, called "Canroys" or "CanRoys," typically trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while some of the larger trusts also trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Canroys usually offer higher yields than U.S. trusts; for non-Canadian investors, this higher yield is reduced by the 15% foreign tax withholding that is absent in the U.S. trusts.
The most significant difference between Canadian and U.S. royalty trusts involves their legal status in their respective countries. In the U.S., trusts are not allowed to acquire additional properties, once they are formed. Since they are restricted to their original properties – for example, a group of oil fields or natural-gas-bearing rock formations—they can be expected to be depleted over time, the royalties they pay out will correspondingly decline, and eventually the trust will be dissolved. In Canada, trusts may be actively managed, and run as businesses. They may have employees, issue new shares, borrow money, acquire additional properties, and may manage the resources themselves.[1]
Bell Canada Enterprises corporate unit Yellow Pages Group converted to Yellow Pages Income Fund on June 25, 2003, making it the "first high-profile conversion to the trust structure." Their income fund raised "$1-billion in the process.":20[5]
According to a 2012 article in Canadian Energy Law,[6]

"The royalty trust and income trust markets trace their origins to 1986 and 1995, respectively. As interest rates declined during the period and beyond these trusts became popular, since they provided lofty yields well in excess of the prevailing interest rate payable by corporations with similar credit ratings. The reason for the discrepancy was primarily due to the fact that royalty trusts and income trusts were flow-through vehicles that avoided the payment of corporate level tax. The yields payable by these trusts varied, but were typically in the 8 – 10% range."
— Doug Richardson 2012

Richardson argued that by 2012 foreign asset income trusts (FAITs) had revived interest regarding income trusts in Canada.[6] Because FAITs involve assets outside Canadian borders, they are "not subject to traditional Specified Investment Flow-Through (SIFT) rules."[6]
Hallowe'en massacre[edit]
In 2006 $70 billion of new trust conversions were announced.[7] The largest was proposed in September 2006 when Bell Canada Enterprise BCE announced its intention to convert its Bell Canada subsidiary to a CanRoy trust thereby saving the corporation $800 million in tax by 2008.[7] The royalty trusts were increasingly popular because they do not pay corporate tax, rather they "pay out most of their income in distributions to unit holders, who then pay tax on those distributions."[7] On October 31, 2006 then-Finance Minister Jim Flaherty made his now famous proposal to introduce new rules — later known as Specified Investment Flow-Through[6](SIFT) rules — nicknamed the "Halloween Massacre."[7] Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper — who was sworn into office February 6, 2006 after winning against the incumbent Paul Martin — the Canadian federal government announced the elimination of the loophole that placed over 250 income trusts at a tax advantage over other corporations. Starting in 2011 "income trusts, with the exception of those focused on real estate, would be subject to a tax on trust distributions"[8] at the full 31.5% rate. Existing trusts would have a four-year transition period (2007 to 2011) whereas newer trusts such as the proposed Bell Canada trust would be applicable in 2007. What prompted the move was that the trusts were costing the Canadian government upwards of $500,000,000 each year in lost revenue.[9] Flaherty described the conversion of corporations into royalty trusts as "a growing trend to corporate tax avoidance" which was hurting the Canadian economy and defended his response as "measured."[7] If the trend of trusts conversions was not stopped, it was estimated that the Canadian federal and provincial governments would lose "$1 billion annually in tax revenue."[7]
Immediately after the announcement share prices of the trusts dropped. Penn West Exploration. then- Penn West Energy Trust) — still referred to as known as Penn West Petroleum in the media — [8] In an interview in January, 2013 Matt Donohue, an analyst at UBS AG in Calgary, argued that the growth-and-income model was "bruised" not "broken" with income trusts converting back into a corporate structure. With the increased use of horizontal drilling in the energy industry, energy trust adopt a hybrid policy that promised both "per-share growth and sustainable income for their shareholders."[8] This model is least lucrative in periods of weak commodity prices.[8]
Since the announcement of the Canadian "Tax Fairness Plan' approximately 90%[citation needed] of Canadian Royalty Trusts (CANROY's) have either converted to corporations, merged with other companies, or simply liquidated. While the Tax Fairness Plan did not require a conversion to corporate status most companies found it beneficial to do so. After conversion most companies were required to slash their dividend payouts to reflect the new level of taxation they would be required to pay.[10]
History of royalty trusts[edit]
Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens is often credited with creating the first royalty trust in 1979; however Marine Petroleum Trust (Marps) was created in 1956, twenty three years earlier.[citation needed]

These trusts often attract investors with their relatively high yields;[2] in 2007, their distributions were often in the 10 to 15 percent annual range. This makes the shares sensitive to interest rates, as share prices are likely to decline in periods of rising interest rates, and to rise when interest rates fall. Additionally, royalty trusts in the United States and Canada usually involve oil and gas fields or mines which are at or past their production peak, and will gradually decline in output as well as revenue; however, the infrastructure to develop them has already been built, so that an investor can expect a reasonably steady income stream.[3]
In addition to allowing investors to achieve high distribution returns, especially during periods of low interest rates, royalty trusts allow investors to speculate directly on commodities such as gas, oil, or iron ore without having to buy futures contracts, or use the other investment vehicles traditionally associated with commodities—since the trusts trade like stocks. During times when a commodity price is rising, the share value as well as the dividend return of a trust engaging in production of that commodity will rise as well.[4]
Canadian royalty trusts (CanRoy)[edit]
Royalty trusts are found mainly in Canada and the United States; there is also one in Germany. Canadian royalty trusts, called "Canroys" or "CanRoys," typically trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while some of the larger trusts also trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Canroys usually offer higher yields than U.S. trusts; for non-Canadian investors, this higher yield is reduced by the 15% foreign tax withholding that is absent in the U.S. trusts.
The most significant difference between Canadian and U.S. royalty trusts involves their legal status in their respective countries. In the U.S., trusts are not allowed to acquire additional properties, once they are formed. Since they are restricted to their original properties – for example, a group of oil fields or natural-gas-bearing rock formations—they can be expected to be depleted over time, the royalties they pay out will correspondingly decline, and eventually the trust will be dissolved. In Canada, trusts may be actively managed, and run as businesses. They may have employees, issue new shares, borrow money, acquire additional properties, and may manage the resources themselves.[1]
Bell Canada Enterprises corporate unit Yellow Pages Group converted to Yellow Pages Income Fund on June 25, 2003, making it the "first high-profile conversion to the trust structure." Their income fund raised "$1-billion in the process.":20[5]
According to a 2012 article in Canadian Energy Law,[6]

"The royalty trust and income trust markets trace their origins to 1986 and 1995, respectively. As interest rates declined during the period and beyond these trusts became popular, since they provided lofty yields well in excess of the prevailing interest rate payable by corporations with similar credit ratings. The reason for the discrepancy was primarily due to the fact that royalty trusts and income trusts were flow-through vehicles that avoided the payment of corporate level tax. The yields payable by these trusts varied, but were typically in the 8 – 10% range."
— Doug Richardson 2012

Richardson argued that by 2012 foreign asset income trusts (FAITs) had revived interest regarding income trusts in Canada.[6] Because FAITs involve assets outside Canadian borders, they are "not subject to traditional Specified Investment Flow-Through (SIFT) rules."[6]
Hallowe'en massacre[edit]
In 2006 $70 billion of new trust conversions were announced.[7] The largest was proposed in September 2006 when Bell Canada Enterprise BCE announced its intention to convert its Bell Canada subsidiary to a CanRoy trust thereby saving the corporation $800 million in tax by 2008.[7] The royalty trusts were increasingly popular because they do not pay corporate tax, rather they "pay out most of their income in distributions to unit holders, who then pay tax on those distributions."[7] On October 31, 2006 then-Finance Minister Jim Flaherty made his now famous proposal to introduce new rules — later known as Specified Investment Flow-Through[6](SIFT) rules — nicknamed the "Halloween Massacre."[7] Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper — who was sworn into office February 6, 2006 after winning against the incumbent Paul Martin — the Canadian federal government announced the elimination of the loophole that placed over 250 income trusts at a tax advantage over other corporations. Starting in 2011 "income trusts, with the exception of those focused on real estate, would be subject to a tax on trust distributions"[8] at the full 31.5% rate. Existing trusts would have a four-year transition period (2007 to 2011) whereas newer trusts such as the proposed Bell Canada trust would be applicable in 2007. What prompted the move was that the trusts were costing the Canadian government upwards of $500,000,000 each year in lost revenue.[9] Flaherty described the conversion of corporations into royalty trusts as "a growing trend to corporate tax avoidance" which was hurting the Canadian economy and defended his response as "measured."[7] If the trend of trusts conversions was not stopped, it was estimated that the Canadian federal and provincial governments would lose "$1 billion annually in tax revenue."[7]
Immediately after the announcement share prices of the trusts dropped. Penn West Exploration. then- Penn West Energy Trust) — still referred to as known as Penn West Petroleum in the media — [8] In an interview in January, 2013 Matt Donohue, an analyst at UBS AG in Calgary, argued that the growth-and-income model was "bruised" not "broken" with income trusts converting back into a corporate structure. With the increased use of horizontal drilling in the energy industry, energy trust adopt a hybrid policy that promised both "per-share growth and sustainable income for their shareholders."[8] This model is least lucrative in periods of weak commodity prices.[8]
Since the announcement of the Canadian "Tax Fairness Plan' approximately 90%[citation needed] of Canadian Royalty Trusts (CANROY's) have either converted to corporations, merged with other companies, or simply liquidated. While the Tax Fairness Plan did not require a conversion to corporate status most companies found it beneficial to do so. After conversion most companies were required to slash their dividend payouts to reflect the new level of taxation they would be required to pay.[10]
History of royalty trusts[edit]
Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens is often credited with creating the first royalty trust in 1979; however Marine Petroleum Trust (Marps) was created in 1956, twenty three years earlier.[citation needed]

Royalty trust

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining. However, unlike most corporations, its profits are not taxed at the corporate level provided a certain high percentage (e.g. 90%) of profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends. The dividends are then taxed as personal income. This system, similar to real estate investment trusts, effectively avoids the double taxation of corporate income.

Characteristics of royalty trusts[edit]
Royalty trusts typically own oil or natural gas wells, the mineral rights of wells, or mineral rights on other types of properties. An outside company must perform the actual operation of the oil or gas field, or mine, and the trust itself, in the United States, may[ambiguous] have no employees. Shares of the trust generally trade on the public stock markets, but the trust itself is typically overseen by a trust officer in a bank.
They are a powerful investment tool for people who wish to invest directly in extraction of petroleum or mining of other materials, but who do not have the resources or risk tolerance to buy their own well or mine. Additionally, since trusts often own numerous individual wells, oil fields, or mines, they represent a convenient way for the average investor to diversify investments across a number of properties. Also, since commodities are considered a hedge against inflation, the popularity of royalty trusts as investments rises as interest rates rise, and their shares often rise as a result.[1]
These trusts often attract investors with their relatively high yields;[2] in 2007, their distributions were often in the 10 to 15 percent annual range. This makes the shares sensitive to interest rates, as share prices are likely to decline in periods of rising interest rates, and to rise when interest rates fall.

What our clients say


It has been over 10 years since I handed over control of my pension to you and this year again, saw another growth year far in the excess of the market norm. Your advice over the years for my personal pension investments, my business and my personal finances has been level, unbiased and honest and I would not hesitate to recommend your services.
Paul Millan 30th May 3017


Paul Millan, Edinburgh 



Hunter Wealth Management took over the management of my pension a year ago. It was a smooth and seamless transition with all items carefully explained along the way. The communication has been excellent at all times, and above all I have seen an improvement in the performance of the fund. I would happily recommend Hunter Wealth Management.
Roger Green,
Director
Spotless Commercial Cleaning Ltd
April 13th 2017


Roger Green, Director, Edinburgh 



I met William Hunter at a networking event, and very soon afterwards became both a corporate and an individual client of Hunter Wealth Management. I have received excellent advice regarding my personal pension and finances, and they sourced an excellent pension provider when my company set up its automated pension system for 75 of my employees.
I have no hesitation in recommending Hunter Wealth Management as they are honest, straightforward, and friendly people who have the expertise and professionalism to get the best financial solutions for your needs.


Ms R. Smyth, Owner of a successful Healthcare business., Edinburgh and Fife 



I became a client of William Hunter when I was approaching retrement and needed to have my pension fund invested and managed to provide a reliable income as well as preserving the value of my fund. William gave me clear advice and undertook the practical arrangements efficiently. He also gave me confidence that in him I was dealing with an experienced IFA who was able to assess my needs and recommend the right solution.


Her Honour Heather Swindells QC. (Retired Circuit Court Judge), Edinburgh 



Finding an IFA who can really listen, truly understands, and able to deliver to your specific needs can be challenging. William gained our trust when we realised his focus was genuinely catered to the individual. With his advice, he helped us prioritise our financial needs putting us in a better financial position each time we meet. His professionalism, coupled with our comfortable working relation gives me confidence to recommend his service to anyone and everyone.


Peter and Catherine Ho, Edinburgh 



William Hunter has been a pleasure to do business with! Since our first introduction 15 years ago, I have found William to be supportive, inventive, bright and innovative, all qualities essential for a good financial adviser. No problem appears insurmountable, William appears unflappable. Most of all, I have enjoyed working with him and have had no reservations in recommending him to my friends, all of whom have received the same excellent service.


Mr Edward Green DL, Trustee of the National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh and Dorset. 



I’ll be perfectly honest with you. I think saving for a future that may never happen is the most ridiculous thing ever. Pensions? Pah. But William Hunter is the only man who managed to make me do just that.
He’s a fantastic IFA with, importantly, a great sense of humour and fantastic team around him. And I know what I’m on about as I’ve dealt with hundreds of IFAs over the years in my previous life as a financial journalist.
Since we’ve started with Hunter Wealth, William has got everything in order – we have protection in case people throw a seven or get crushed by something heavy, we have pensions in case someone dares to live past 50 or 60 and we have lots of other things that are actually very important but I knew nothing about before I met him.
All in all, a top guy with a top firm. The only downside is that he’s Scottish but then, as a Welshman, I can forgive him that.


Mr D Hiatt,, Regent Street, London 



I have used the professional services of William Hunter for several years now, and have been very happy with the relationship.
He listens carefully to my stated requirements, offers options which are described in straightforward terms, and implements decisions in prompt fashion, aided by his responsive office support team.
William has also facilitated access to other professional services (Legal, Stockbroking, Foreign Exchange) and always offers appropriate access to his network of professionals. I am more than happy to endorse his credentials.
I have happily recommended him to others.


Mr & Mrs Graham, International and now Edinburgh

Hunter
Investment Management


















HUNTER


HUNTER Investment Management
Inspired by the New Zealand falcon/kārearea.
Capable of flying at speeds over 100 km/h and catching prey larger than itself, the New Zealand falcon is one of our most spectacular birds.
 











OUR FUNDS


Hunter Global Fixed Interest Fund
The Hunter Global Fixed Interest Fund (the Fund) is a PIE-compliant New Zealand-domiciled fund with investments managed by PIMCO.
The key features of the Fund, including the risk and return objectives, are:

Benchmarked against the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index 100% New Zealand dollar hedged.
The investment objective is to outperform the benchmark +1% per annum with target ex-post tracking error of 3%.
Duration +/- 3 years of benchmark.
Minimum average credit quality A-.
Individual portfolio of underlying securities (segregated portfolio of securities held by the PIE Fund). This provides transparency of underlying assets, removes offshore fund costs, and may be more tax efficient for NZ investors. Each investor must make their own assessment of the impact of tax on their investment.
Daily unit pricing.

Implemented Investment Solutions (IIS) is the issuer and manager of the Fund.  IIS is licenced as a manager of registered investment schemes under the Financial Markets Conduct Act, and currently manages over $1 billion on behalf of clients.
IIS have agreed a mandate with PIMCO that ensures they can use all aspects of their investment expertise to add value to the Fund. This mandate does not restrict PIMCO in terms of their ability to add value from duration, credit, country, and currency management. It does include restrictions relating to areas like cluster munitions, tobacco, and oil (with specific details of these available from IIS).  We believe it is extremely important that PIMCO has full discretion to actively manage the Fund’s portfolio in all market cycles, while also recognizing factors like New Zealand’s laws relating to cluster munitions. The Fund’s assets are invested 100% in a directly held diversified portfolio of global fixed income securities, derivatives and cash managed by PIMCO.  PIMCO Australia PTY Limited are the contracting entity for PIMCO and the portfolio management is undertaken by PIMCO’s global bond team led by Andrew Balls in London, with Sachin Gupta in Newport Beach, California.
The Fund is registered as an offer within a Managed Investment Scheme under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and is regulated by the FMA.
Hunter Investment Management (Hunter) promotes and distributes the Fund. Tony Hildyard is the Managing Director and is responsible for managing all client relationships.
PIE status and other tax treatments
The Fund is a PIE and is taxed under the financial arrangements (accruals) rules.  The Fund and portfolio structure is intended to be tax efficient for New Zealand investors, including tax exempt clients.
Supervisor
The Supervisor of the Fund is the Public Trust.  The Public Trust is responsible for monitoring the manager, checking that the fund is operated in accordance with the governing documents, and for ensuring the safekeeping of the scheme property. Public Trust has appointed BNP Paribas as independent custodian of the scheme property.
Administrator
The administrator of the Fund is BNP Paribas.  They provide fund accounting, unit pricing, performance reporting, independent mandate compliance monitoring and registry services.
Auditors
PWC is the auditor of the Fund.
