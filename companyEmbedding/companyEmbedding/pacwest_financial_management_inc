Clients First
The Fiduciary Standard for investment advisers was established as part of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) holds Advisors to a fiduciary standard that requires them to act in the best interest of the client – specifically stating that they must put their clients’ interests above their own. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires Advisors, as fiduciaries, to act in the best interest of their clients and avoid or disclose any conflicts of interest.
PacWest’s culture is tostrive to always put the clients interest first. We are interested to obtain a clear understanding of what is important to our clients so that we can be effective in achieving each client’s particular goals and needs.
The management fee and/or financial planning fee is the only income we earn. PacWest does not earn commissions on transactions, or kickbacks from mutual fund companies for using their products.
Accessible
It is our goal to be accessible to our clients. We can be reached by phone, email or mail. We avoid the use of voice mail so clients can reach us very easily. We are available to answer questions regarding client’s accounts and about their investments, or to move funds and other administrative needs. We take pride in meeting the needs of our clients in a timely and professional manner
PacWest’s forward looking outlook of the economy and investment is communicated on a monthly basis in our Monthly Market Cycle Monitor. Additionally, our Quarterly Newsletter includes timely, relevant topics on the economy, financial planning, or investing. We also provide Transaction Advisories from time to time to share with you PacWest’s rationale for certain investment decisions. During the year, we will also conduct formal reviews to share with you in person how your investments are performing and check to see if your circumstances have changed since our last meeting and to answer any questions you may have.
Transparent
In our relationship with you, everything is transparent. We do not have custody of your assets. Your assets are held either at Schwab or Fidelity or National Advisors Trust Company. The investment advisory agreement allows PacWest to manage your securities held at your custodian. We interface with your custodian to execute trades and to process distribution requests that you have initiated. Whenever we trade on your behalf, you will receive a confirmation from the custodian showing you the transactions and the execution prices. You will be able to monitor your account on-line through your custodian’s website and see how your account is performing on a real-time basis. You will receive a monthly statement from your custodian as well as a quarterly statement from us. Along with PacWest’s quarterly statement, will be an invoice which indicates how much you paid us in management fees for managing your account over the most recent quarter and how those fees were calculated.

“Why should I work with PacWest?”
PacWest has been based in Phoenix since ‘97 and Grace, the President and Founder, has been a part of the investment community since 1979.
The investment platform is built on open architecture because we do not have any proprietary products. We are fee-only which means that we do not sell products of any kind.
We are service driven. We meet and communicate with our clients frequently. We do not use voice mail during office hours, so when you call, you will always talk to a live person. We are flexible and adapt to meet our client’s needs. We know all our clients and understand what is important to them.
We have a team of professionals that have advance credentials to offer solutions in critical areas of our clients’ financial lives. Designations include Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA®), MBAs, and Certified Financial Planner (CFP®).
Finally, we do our own investment research so we are fully accountable for our investment decisions



“Who are your clients?”
Our clients are predominantly high net-worth individuals focused on wealth preservation and wealth enhancement. They created their wealth through many years of hard work. We know the importance of these assets and we invest them with care and caution. We also manage assets for a number of institutions.



“What is it like to work with PacWest?”
We want you to have an exceptional client experience from the very beginning of our relationship. You will be able to share with us what is important to you in the management of your portfolio. An action plan will be created to help you achieve success in your financial goals. We will design a custom portfolio for your review and approval.
Regular meetings will be scheduled for continuous update and reporting. In the interim you will receive our monthly newsletter which describes our current outlook on the financial markets and asset allocation. You will also receive quarterly statements with performance data, a holdings report and a fee invoice.
Clients can call us at any time if there are additional questions. We will respond in a timely manner.



“How do I know if I need professional wealth and money management?”
You may want to consider hiring a professional money manager if you do not have the time, interest or knowledge to manage your portfolio. We know that your pool of assets represents years of hard work and savings by you or someone you love. We would be honored if you chose us to manage those assets for you and ease your burden of having to worry about whether you are making smart financial decisions. We will ensure that your money is being managed prudently for the long-term. We can also assist you in certain areas of tax, estate, insurance and retirement planning.
Regular meetings will be scheduled for continuous update and reporting. In the interim you will receive our monthly newsletter which describes our current outlook on the financial markets and asset allocation. You will also receive quarterly statements with performance data, a holdings report and a fee invoice.
Clients can call us at any time if there are additional questions. We will respond in a timely manner.



“Is my money safe?”
PacWest is not a broker/dealer and is not the custodian of any of our clients’ assets.
Your assets are held by third party custodians (Schwab, Fidelity or National Advisors Trust). PacWest only holds limited power of attorney to act as your investment advisor. Money movement will have to be authorized by you in writing and sent to the custodians for their processing.



“How do you select investments?”
Each portfolio can include stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds. We select investments based upon in-house research, valuation models, company-specific and industry-specific news and trends, as well as reports from outside analysts.
Individual stocks are selected from a database of 6600 stocks. We narrow the list down to approximately 150 companies that we believe will be the successful competitors in their respective industry. From this list, about 65 companies are selected for the portfolio based upon consistency of earnings, earnings growth, and relative valuation.
If our clients need income or want less volatility in their portfolio, we may use government, corporate, municipal bonds, exchange traded bond funds and bond mutual funds to lower volatility and generate cash flow. We select bonds based upon attractive yields relative to their credit ratings, maturities and other criteria.
All investments in the portfolios are liquid. PacWest only selects securities that are listed and clients can tell what their portfolios are worth on a daily basis. Cash can be raised daily and is available for withdrawal in three to five business days.
