Overview
The Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Forms G and H, is a reading survey test for high school and college students and adults. A two-part test, the Nelson-Denny measures vocabulary development, comprehension, and reading rate. Part I (Vocabulary) is a fifteen-minute timed test; Part II (Comprehension and Rate) is a twenty-minute test. The first minute of the Comprehension test is used to determine reading rate. Including the time needed to distribute materials, complete the name and information grids, and provide directions, the Nelson-Denny may be administered in forty-five minutes, or a single class period.
The Nelson-Denny Reading Test:

Aids in accurate placement of high school and college students at all reading levels
Provides comprehension passages drawn from widely used high school and college texts
Includes a vocabulary section that focuses on words students need for success in today's classrooms
Offers optional extended-time administration to meet the needs of special populations
Eliminates racial and gender bias
Includes national norms for high schools and two-and four-year colleges

A unique feature of the 1993 edition is the extended-time administration of the test to meet the needs of special populations, such as students with English as a second language or as a foreign language, or returning adults.
The 1993 edition of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Forms G and H, is the current edition of this widely used high school and college test. All test items and reading passages are exclusive to this edition and appear in a test format similar to that used in earlier editions. The basic test format was retained because of its wide acceptance by test users.
Other changes from previous editions include a reduction in the number of vocabulary items from 100 to 80 and inclusion of seven rather than eight reading comprehension passages, with a total of 38 rather than 36 items. These changes advance a trend in recent Nelson-Denny forms away from speediness and toward measurement of reading power.
Forms
Forms G and H are parallel forms that have been equated and can be used interchangeably as pretests and posttests. The equating study linking them is described in the Technical Report. An equating study of Form G and Form E links Forms G and H to the earlier Forms E and F. Thus, data for students previously tested with Form E or F can be related to data provided by Form G or H. Form G/Form E equating data and tables are provided in the Manual for Scoring and Interpretation.

                             Scoring
                         


The scores available for Vocabulary, Comprehension, and Total are raw scores, scale scores, grade-equivalent scores, normal curve equivalent scores, national percentile ranks, and national stanines. The reading rate is reported in words per minute. The scoring key and procedures for obtaining all scores are included in the Manual for Scoring and Interpretation.
Standardization and Norms
The national standardization and norming of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test was completed during the 1992-1993 school year. Norms are available for high school and two- and four-year colleges. Special norms are available for the extended-time administration and for law-enforcement academies. All norms conversion tables are included in the Manual for Scoring and Interpretation. Information about the standardization and other technical data are included in the Technical Report.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement.

This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Description:

[0001] This non-provisional application is based upon and claims priority from Provisional Application No. 60/016,135 filed Apr. 24, 1996. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to dental products comprising cyclodextrins. [0003] Dental plaque is present to some degree, in the form of a film, on virtually all dental surfaces. It is a by-product of microbial growth, and comprises a dense microbial layer consisting of a mass of micro-organisms embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. The micro-organisms present in plaque are mainly coccoidal organisms, particularly in early plaque. As plaque ages and matures, gram negative anaerobes and filamentous organisms appear and become more common after a few days. Plaque itself adheres to dental surfaces and may not be removed completely even with a rigorous brushing regimen and can build up, for example, in recessed areas of tooth surfaces, such as approximal regions and fissures. Moreover, plaque rapidly reforms on the tooth surface after it is removed. [0004] Plaque may form on any part of the tooth surfaces, and can be found particularly at the gingival margin, in pits and fissures in the enamel, and on the surface of dental calculus. The danger associated with the formation of plaque on the teeth lies in the tendency of plaque to build up and eventually contribute to gingivitis, periodontitis and other types of periodontal disease, as well as dental caries and dental calculus. [0005] More specifically, dental plaque is a precursor to the formation of the hard crystalline build up on teeth referred to as dental calculus. Both the bacterial and the nonbacterial components of plaque mineralize to form calculus, which comprises mineralized bacteria as well as organic constituents, such as epithelial cells, live bacteria, salivary proteins, leukocytes, and crystalline substances containing both calcium and phosphorous, e.g., hydroxyapatite, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, octacalcium phosphate, Ca8(HPO4)2(PO4)45H2O, brushite, CaHPO4-.2H2O, and whitlockite, which is considered to have the formula β-Ca3(PO4)2. Dental plaque and, hence, calculus are particularly prone to form at the gingival margin. i.e., the junction of the tooth and gingiva. The buildup of plaque at, and below, the gingival margin is believed to be the prime cause of gingivitis and periodontal disorders. [0006] Mouthwashes have been formulated to contain antimicrobial ingredients whose function is to reduce the buildup of plaque, either by the direct bactericidal action (i.e. killing) on plaque and salivary micro-organisms and by bacteriostatic action (i.e. growth inhibition) on plaque and salivary micro-organisms. Scheie, A. AA. (1989) Modes of Action of Currently Known Chemical Anti-Plaque Agents Other than Chlorhexidine. J. Dent. Res. 68 Special Issue: 1609-1616. Oral compositions including mouthwashes and dentifrices containing phenolic compounds are referred to in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,945,087; WO 94/16.16,674; WO 94/07477; and WO 94/18939. Oral composition including triclosan are referred to in the following: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,892,220; 5,032,386; 5,037,637; 5,034,154; 5,080,887; 5,236,699; 5,043,154; 5,032,385; and 5,156,835 as well as EPO 85303216.7. [0007] However phenolics useful in oral compositions have low aqueous solubilities which limit their use in oral compositions and they require high levels of either 1) alcohol; 2) surfactants; or 3) co-solvents or combinations of the above for sufficient solubility in the carrier. PCT Appin No. WO 94/16674. [0008] For example, thymol has been used as a anthelmintic and antiseptic, in mouthwashes containing a combination of menthol, methyl salicylate, eucalyptol and thymol. However, these compositions are characterized by their relatively high alcohol levels which causes them to have negative aesthetics, including excessive “bite” and “burn.” [0009] Triclosan (2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxydiphenyl ether) is a phenolic, nonionic antimicrobial agent used in various soap and toiletry products. In the oral care area, triclosan has been used as a plaque-inhibitory agent in various toothpastes and mouthrinses. Triclosan is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial that has shown activity in in vitro assays. Regos, J. and Hitz, H. R.

Although triclosan when delivered orally, is taken up by plaque and is moderately substantive, its bioactivity is limited by its poor aqueous solubility. Thus, triclosan has to be solubilized either by alcohol or surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate when formulated into a conventional dentifrice or mouthrinse product. Kjaerheim, V , Waaler, S. M.

[0010] Cyclodextrins are known to form inclusion complexes with various compounds. The cyclodextrin molecule consists of glucopyranose units arranged in a torus-like or donut-like configuration having all the secondary hydroxyl groups located on one side of the torus and all primary hydroxyl groups located on the other side. Alpha, beta, and gamma cyclodextrin contain 6, 7 & 8 cyclic glucopyranose units, respectively, in the torus shell. The “lining” of the internal cavity is formed by hydrogen and glucosidic oxygen-bridge atoms and therefore the surface is slightly apolar. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0011] The present invention relates to an oral rinse composition, comprising: [0012] a) from about 0.01% to about 2.5% by weight of a phenolic, said phenolic selected from the group consisting of menthol, eucalyptol, methyl salicylate, thymol, triclosan, and mixtures thereof; [0013] b) From about 0.1% by weight to about 25% by weight of a cyclodextrin, said cyclodextrin selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropyl γ-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl β-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl γ-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl γ-cyclodextrin, α-cyclodextrin, methyl β-cyclodextrin, and mixtures thereof; [0014] c) Up to about 25% by weight ethanol; and [0015] d) an orally acceptable carrier. [0016] The present invention also relates to a dentifrice in the form of a toothpaste or tooth gel, comprising: [0017] a) from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of a phenolic, said phenolic selected from the group consisting of menthol, eucalyptol, methyl salicylate, thymol, triclosan, and mixtures thereof; [0018] b) From about 0.1% by weight to about 60% by weight of a cyclodextrin, said cyclodextrin selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl β-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl γ-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl γ-cyclodextrin, α-cyclodextrin, methyl β-cyclodextrin, and mixtures thereof; [0019] c) up to about 60% by weight of an orally acceptable dental abrasive, for example, silica, alumina, calcium pyrophosphate and calcium carbonate; and [0020] d) an orally acceptable carrier.

[0022] The present also relates to a method for retarding development of plaque on a dental surface in the oral cavity of a mammal, comprising administering to said dental surface an amount of said dentifrice effective in retarding said development of plaque. [0023] The present also relates to a method of treating gingivitis, comprising administering to a mammal in need of such treatment an amount of said oral rinse composition effective in treating gingivitis. [0024] The present also relates to a method of treating gingivitis, comprising administering to a mammal in need of such treatment an amount of said dentifrice effective in treating gingivitis.

[0026] The present also relates to a method of treating the presence of micro-organisms in the oral cavity of a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal in need of such treatment an amount of said dentifrice effective in reducing the viable population of said micro-organisms. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0027] Compositions of the present invention include low-alcohol oral care compositions that contain cyclodextrin compounds which solubilize phenolic antimicrobial compounds As a result of higher levels of solubilized phenolics in a solution, the phenolic compounds have improved bioavailability in treating plaque, as well as providing compositions having excellent low-temperature stability. These compositions retard the development of plaque as well as treat gingivitis and periodontal diseases without the use of high alcohol levels, high surfactant levels or the use of other co-solvents. [0028] Phenolics useful as antimicrobials in the present invention and effective in treating micro-organisms present in the oral cavity of a mammal include menthol, methyl salicylate, eucalyptol, thymol and triclosan. Thymol and triclosan are generally considered to have the best antimicrobial activity of these phenolics. For oral rinses, phenolic compounds or mixtures thereof preferably range from about 0.01% by weight to about 0.5% by weight; more preferably from about 0.05% by weight to about 0.3% by weight. For dentifrices, the amount of phenolic compounds or a mixture thereof preferably range from about 0.01% by weight to about 5% by weight, more preferably from about 0.25% by weight to about 3% by weight. [0029] Molecules, or functional groups of molecules having molecular dimensions that match the cyclodextrin cavity, being less hydrophilic (i.e. more hydrophobic) than water, will position themselves in the cyclodextrin cavity at the expense of water molecules. In aqueous solutions, the slightly apolar cyclodextrin cavity is occupied by water molecules which are energetically unfavored (polar-apolar interaction) and are therefore readily substituted by appropriate “guest molecules” which are less polar than water. In the case of the present invention, the “guest molecules” are the phenolic ingredients mentioned above. [0030] Suitable cyclodextrins useful in the present invention include hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl β-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl γ-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl γ-cyclodextrin, a-cyclodextrin and methyl β-cyclodextrin. Suitable candidate cyclodextrins typically have to have an aqueous solubility of at least about 10% by weight and form sufficiently soluble phenolic-cyclodextrin complexes to be suitable for this invention. Hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin is the preferred cyclodextrin. [0031] Each of the seven cyclic glucopyranose units in β-cyclodextrin contains three hydroxyl groups in the 2-,3- and 6-positions, which can be etherified. In the case of the partially etherified cyclodextrin derivatives used in this invention, only some of these positions are substituted with hydroxyethyl or hydroxypropyl groups. A wide range of substitutions can be made per molecule up to a maximum of 18 The preferred range of substitution ranges from about 0.5 to 8 positions. Thus, hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin is a chemically modified cyclodextrin consisting of an amorphous isomeric mixture of thousands of geometric and optical isomers with varying degrees of substitution and varying numbers of hydroxypropyl substituents, however the size of the cyclodextrin cavity is constant for these isomers. [0032] For oral rinses, these amount of soluble cyclodextrin ranges from about 0.1% by weight to about 25% by weight, preferably from about 0.5% by weight to about 20% by weight, more preferably from about 1% by weight to about 5% by weight, selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl β-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl γ-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl γ-cyclodextrin, α-cyclodextrin, methyl β-cyclodextrin, and mixtures thereof are useful for the invention For dentifrices, the amount of soluble cyclodextrin ranges from about 0.1% by weight to about 60% by weight, preferably from about 5% by weight to about 30% by weight selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl β-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl γ-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl γ-cyclodextrin, α-cyclodextrin, methyl β-cyclodextrin, and mixtures thereof are useful for the invention. [0033] For dentifrice compositions suitable abrasives include precipitated silica or silica gels which have an average particle size ranging from about 0.1 to about 50 microns. Preferred silica abrasives include those marketed under the tradename “Sylodent®” or “Syloid®” by the W. R. Grace & Co. and those marketed under the tradename “Zeodent®” by the J. M. Huber Corp. Other suitable abrasives, having a suitable particle size as described above, include β-phase calcium pyrophosphate, alumina and calcium carbonate. The amount of abrasive in a dentifrice composition ranges up to about 60% by weight, preferably from 10% by weight to 40% by weight. [0034] Dentifrice and oral rinse compositions also may contain a suitable fluoride source. Typical sources include soluble salts of the fluoride ion; e.g. sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, stannous fluoride, stannous fluorozirconate etc.; or, soluble salts of the monofluorophosphate ion; e.g. sodium monofluorophosphate etc. The preferred fluoride source is sodium fluoride. The fluoride ion source should be sufficient to provide from about 50 ppm to about 2,500 ppm fluoride, preferably from about 250 ppm to about 1500 ppm for dentifrices and from about 50 ppm to about 250 ppm fluoride for oral rinses. [0035] A liquid carrier generally includes mixtures of water and ethanol for oral rinses, although the carrier can be alcohol-free, especially in dentifrices. For oral rinses, the amount of water ranges upwards from about 25% by weight. The amount of alcohol ranges by weight from about 0% to about 25% by weight, preferably from about 0% by weight to about 15% by weight. For dentifrices, the amount of water ranges from about 0% by weight to about 60% by weight, preferably from about 0% by weight to about 40% by weight. [0036] The pH of the oral rinses and dentifrice compositions can range from about 3.5 to about 8.5. [0037] The oral rinse compositions, for example, Examples 1 to 5, are unusually stable so as to be substantially clear and substantially free of precipitation, flocculation, or crystal formation at about room temperature (about 25° C.) as well as at low temperatures of at least about 5° C. for at least about 1 week. The low temperature stability of these compositions is determined by cooling the compositions to about 5° C., storing for at least seven days and determining whether any precipitate, crystallized or flocculated material is formed in the clear compositions (solutions and gels). [0038] Oral surfactants useful in the present invention include nonionic and anionic surfactants. Oral surfactants employed include block co-polymers of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene such as the Pluronics from BASF. Other oral surfactants include soluble alkyl sulfonates having 10 to 18 carbon atoms, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, and sulfates of monoglycerides of fatty acids having 10 to 18 carbon atoms or sarcosinates (including salts and derivatives) such as sodium-N-lauroyl sarcosinate. Mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants can be used. These ingredients are generally present from about 0% by weight to about 4% by weight, preferably from about 0% by weight to about 1% by weight for oral rinses and from about 0.5% by weight to about 4% by weight for dentifrices. [0039] Additional antiplaque agents can also be optionally added to the compositions. These include cetyl pyridinium chloride and related quaternary salts, chlorhexidine, zinc salts such as zinc chloride, stannous salts such as stannous chloride or stannous fluoride and peroxygens such as hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. These optional antiplaque agents are generally present at levels ranging form about 0% to about 5% by weight. [0040] Additional anticalculus agents can be optionally added to the compositions. These include tetra-alkali or di-alkali metal pyrophosphate salts and zinc salts, such as, but not limited to, zinc chloride etc. These optional anticalculus agents are generally present at levels ranging from about 0% by weight to about 10% by weight for pyrophosphate salts and from about 0% by. weight to about 3% by weight for zinc salts. [0041] In compositions relating to the invention, preservatives may be used, especially for non-alcohol or low alcohol compositions. These include benzoic acid, sodium benzoate, methylparaben, propylparaben, sorbic acid and potassium sorbate. These optional preservative agents are generally present at levels ranging from about 0% by weight to about 2% by weight. [0042] In compositions relating to the invention, buffering systems may be used to stabilize the pH in the product. Typical buffering systems include, but are not limited to, citrate, benzoate, gluconate and phosphate. Buffering systems are present in concentrations from about 0.01% by weight to about 1% by weight. [0043] In addition to the above ingredients, the invention may include other optional ingredients to impart desired mouth feel and provide flavoring and coloring. [0044] Humectants are an optional component of the compositions. For oral rinses they impart a moist and elegant feel to the mouth and in toothpaste compositions they prevent hardening on exposure to air. Some humectants can provide sweetness to the composition. Suitable humectants include edible polyhydric alcohols such as glycerin, sorbitol, propylene glycol and xylitol. The humectant generally is present in an amount ranging from 0% by weight to 30% by weight for oral rinses and 0% by weight to 70% by weight for dentifrice compositions. [0045] Thickening agents or binders are an optional component of the compositions. Typical thickening include, xanthan gum, carrageenan, carboxyvinyl polymers, carbomers, cellulose gums such as carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose derivatives such as hydroxyethylcellulose and silicas. Thickeners are usually present in the compositions from about 0% by weight to 2% by weight. Xanthan gum is the preferred thickener in oral rinses. In dentifrices, silica-based thickeners can be used at concentrations from 0% by weight to about 20% by weight. “Sylox®” by W. R. Grace & Co. is the tradename of the preferred silica-based thickener. [0046] Flavoring agents can be added to the compositions. The flavorant may be a flavoring oil or mixture of flavoring oils such as oil of peppermint, spearmint, wintergreen, clove, sassafras, lemon, orange or lime. Sweetening agents such as saccharin, lactose, maltose, aspartame, sodium cyclamate, polydextrose etc. can be added to the compositions. Flavoring agents generally are present in an amount ranging from 0.001% by weight to about 0.5% by weight for oral rinses and 0.25% by weight to about 5% by weight for dentifrice compositions. Sweetening agents generally are present in an amount ranging from 0.001% by weight to about 5% by weight for oral rinse and dentifrice compositions. Coloring agents generally are present in an amount ranging from 0% by weight to 0.01% by weight.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREChanging God's Way: By Breaking The Chains Of Sinby Nelson, Dennis J.Changing God's Way: By Breaking the Chains of Sin -WORKBOOK-The purpose of the WORKBOOK is to help those using the book Changing God's Way By Breaking the Chains of Sin within a 12 week bible study format. By completing the lessons the reader will learn how to change God's way. How can a man break the chains of sin? By changing God's way, by changing from the inside out, and by walking on His &quot;Highway of Holiness&quot; (Isa. 35:8). The answer to breaking the bondages of sexual sin is simple, repentance unlocks God's sanctifying river. We must become like the &quot;tax-gatherer&quot; crying out &quot;God, be merciful to me, the sinner!...The world is full of lustful feeding stations. Just think of your average day. How much of it is filled with the world's view of sexuality? How much of that is willfully entertained by your will? Men are bombarded with fleshly images from our TVs, grocery story magazine racks, billboards, internet news, etc. The Christian man does not need to visit the local porn shop or massage parlor to feed lust. Just walking through the local grocery store a man's visuals are bombarded with seminude women at the exit counter to lingerie ads hanging down in the isles...Victory will begin for a sexual addict when he realizes that he cannot obtain freedom on his own. This recognition allows God to work giving hope and encouragement. The battle overcoming the flesh will be a long and hard one. A person who has lived for years indulging in sexual sin will take time to recover. Sanctification in all areas will not be instantaneous but will comprise of a faith road in order that &quot;the righteousness of God is (progressively) revealed from (His) faith to (our) faith&quot; (Rom. 1:17). I believe that the bondage of sexual sin, like most other sin, can be broken quite easily if a person is willing to surrender it all to God and create healthy habits that honor God. I m not fond of the struggle I relish the victory of the cross!  Pastor Ken BehrIf you are a man who desires to become a champion for Christ, I highly suggest you read and apply the wisdom of &quot;Changing God's Way&quot;. Dennis Nelson's straightforward writing style will challenge, encourage, and hopefully, provide a highway to freedom from sexual sin. A word of caution however, this is not a book for the faint of heart, or those who want to merely give lip service to being a dedicated Christ-follower. This is a book to help move men from &quot;playing church&quot; and into their calling as warriors for the King of kings. It all begins with the battle for personal holiness, are you up for the challenge of &quot;Changing God's Way&quot;? Michael Armbrust: Church Planting Missionary  My friend Dennis tells his story of deliverance while teaching what the Bible communicates on the subject of sexual sin. It's a powerful story of a life restored to purity and authenticity by choosing God's way to break the chains of sin. Every man interested in living a life of victory should read this book.
