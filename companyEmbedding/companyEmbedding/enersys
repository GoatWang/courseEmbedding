Welcome EnerSys Suppliers






 Please take a few minutes to read about us and the features made available through this site.

The Purchasing Organization
The EnerSys procurement function is centralized at the corporate headquarters in Reading, PA for supplier selection, 
price negotiations and supplier performance measurement. The day-to-day buying activities are decentralized, with purchasing 
departments at all major manufacturing locations. Corporate and plant personnel in North America, Europe and Asia work together 
as a cohesive team for EnerSys.

Mission Statement
The EnerSys Corporate Purchasing Department will strategically develop strong relationships with key suppliers; obtain 
maximum value in terms of quality, service, technology, processing and total costs; provide leadership and tools to improve 
inventory investment; and reduce lead times to assist all manufacturing locations to meet or exceed their goals.

Code of Ethics
Relationships between EnerSys and their suppliers must be based on mutual respect and integrity. The Purchasing Team, both 
Corporate and Plant, are to maintain the highest standards and principles of business ethics, courtesy and competence in dealings 
and transactions with suppliers.

Supplier Partnerships
We at EnerSys strongly believe that our suppliers are the experts in their respective fields and therefore, are best qualified 
to identify areas for improvement. Our close working relationships with our suppliers are crucial to the long term success of 
our organization. When evaluating potential suppliers, we not only look at the quality of the products or service provided in terms 
of first pass yield and on-time delivery, we extend the evaluation to include competitive position, price, value analysis, technical 
competence and support, lead time and customer focus. The goal of each partnership is the development of a long-term, mutually 
beneficial and prosperous relationship.

Supplier Diversity
It is our policy to provide minority and woman-owned business enterprises (MWBE) an equal opportunity to participate in all aspects 
our supplier contractual opportunities including, but not limited to: procurement opportunities (raw materials, services, MRO, etc.), 
construction projects, professional services and leasing activities. It is also our policy to prohibit discrimination against any 
person or business in pursuit of these opportunities on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability 
or veteran's status.

Supplier Selection
The selection of suppliers is a critical function of Corporate Purchasing and we recognize that the "lowest price" is not always 
the best price. Supplier selection criteria are varied and generally fall into the following major areas:

  Cooperative and creative management philosophy
     Flexible production planning that quickly responds to our plant's needs
     Consistent on-time delivery
     Technical analysis and support
     Competitive pricing
     Cost reduction programs

Using this application, suppliers will be able to determine the carrier selection based on origin, destination and shipment type 
(full truck or LTL). A user name and password are required to access this area.

SpecMaster
SpecMaster is an EnerSys-developed application that allows existing suppliers to request electronic design specifications. SpecMaster 
is currently only operational for our North American facilities. Suppliers are required to have a valid, EnerSys-assigned supplier code and 
have an email address on file with EnerSys.

Description
Enersys (Hawker) Cyclon 0820-0004 BC-Cell 2 Volt/25 Amp Hour Sealed Lead Acid Battery Threaded Post Terminals M6 Negative, M8 Positive
Product Information

Per unit weight, the power provided bypure lead products offers the greatest high-rate power density for your energy dollar. CYCLON battery’s greater volumetric power allows engineers to consider more energy-supporting features.
Compared to competitive lead products (offering up to 200 full cycles), pure lead-tin batteries provide 50% to 200% greater full cycle capability. CYCLON product will deliver up to 300 cycles (100% DOD, C/5).
Conventional sealed-lead batteries vary greatly in specified standby life: from three to six years at 20C, C/20. CYCLON Single Cells, however, offer a ten-year design life at 25C, C/5, to 80% of rated capacity.
High stable voltage delivery – The high stable voltage delivery of a pure lead-tin battery results from its low internal resistance. The flat discharge voltage profile of our batteries, similar to Nickel Cadmium.
Since CYCLON Single Cells and Monoblocs emit minimal to no gassing under normal charging conditions they are safe for installation in offices, aircraft cabins, hospitals or any other environment occupied by human beings.
Due to the product’s strong construction and high vent pressures, these cells will maintain their performance and physical parameters in extreme conditions.
Due to their strong external packaging and internal pure lead-tin composition, EnerSys’ products can withstand not only extreme temperatures but also harsh usage.
EnerSys’ pure lead-tin chemistry allows our batteries and cells to offer the highest recharge efficiency of any sealed-lead battery on the market. With pure lead-tin, you can achieve a 95% state of recharge in less than one hour
Due to the products’ mechanical design, CYCLON can be mounted and operated in any position, an attractive feature for less accessible areas.
Pure lead-tin batteries have an extremely low self-discharge rate, thus providing extended storage capability while maintaining high state-ofcharge levels for dependable operation.

Enersys (Hawker) Cyclon 0819-0016 D-Cell 12 Volt/2.5 Amp Hour Sealed Lead Acid Battery 


                        Per unit weight, the power provided bypure lead products offers the greatest high-rate power density for your energy dollar. CYCLON battery's greater volumetric power allows engineers to consider more energy-supporting features., Compared to competitive lead products (offering up to 200 full                        
                             cycles), pure lead-tin batteries provide 50% to 200% greater full cycle capability. CYCLON product will deliver up to 300 cycles (100% DOD, C/5)., Conventional sealed-lead batteries vary greatly in specified standby life: from three to six years at 20C, C/20. CYCLON Single Cells, however, offer a ten-year design life at 25C, C/5, to 80% of rated capacity., High stable voltage delivery</b> - The high stable voltage delivery of a pure lead-tin battery results from its low internal resistance. The flat discharge voltage profile of our batteries, similar to Nickel Cadmium., Since CYCLON Single Cells and Monoblocs emit minimal to no gassing under normal charging conditions they are safe for installation in offices, aircraft cabins, hospitals or any other environment occupied by human beings.,

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
