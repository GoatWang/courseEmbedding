Richardb aDepartment of Biochemistry and Applied Chemistry, Kurume National College of Technology, Komorinomachi, Kurume 830-8555, Japan.bDepartment of Chemistry, University at Buffalo, SUNY, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA. Corresponding author: John P. Richard (e-mail: jrichard@buffalo.edu). This article is part of a Special Issue dedicated to Professor Stan Brown Stan in honour of his seminal contributions to physical organic chemistry. The authors dedicate this paper to Professor Brown in recognition of his continuing contributions to science and his efforts to promote the interests of the North American Chemical Community. Published on the web 8 September 2014.Received July 22, 2014. Accepted September 1, 2014. Canadian Journal of Chemistry, 2015, 93(4): 428-434, https://doi.org/10.1139/cjc-2014-0337Abstract The products of the reactions of 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl tosylate (MeO-1-OTs) and 2-(4-methyphenyl)ethyl tosylate (Me-1-OTs) with nucleophilic anions were determined for reactions in 50:50 (v/v) trifluoroethanol (TFE) / water at 25 °C. In many cases, the nucleophile selectivity kNu/ks ((mol/L)−1) for reactions of nucleophile and solvent, calculated from the ratio of product yields, depends upon [Nu−]. This demonstrates the existence of competing reaction pathways, which show different selectivities for reactions with nucleophiles. A 13C NMR analysis of the products of the reactions of substrate enriched with 13C at the α-carbon, X-1-[α-13C]OTs (X = −OCH3 or −Me), with nucleophilic anions in 50:50 (v/v) TFE/water at 25 °C shows the formation of X-1-[β-13C]OH, X-1-[β-13C]OCH2CF3, and X-1-[β-13C]Nu (Nu = Br, Cl, CH3CO2, or Cl2CHCO2) from the trapping of symmetrical phenonium ion reaction intermediates X-2+. The observation of excess label in the α-position, [α-13C]/[β-13C] > 1.0, for both the water and nucleophile adducts, shows that these nucleophiles also react by direct substitution at X-1-[α-13C]OTs. The ratios of product yields, [α-13C]/[β-13C], and observed nucleophile selectivity (kNu/ks)obs were used to dissect the contribution of nucleophile addition at Me-1-OTs and trapping of X-2+ to the product yields. The product yields from partitioning of the intermediate gave the nucleophile selectivity kNu/ks for X-2+. Swain–Scott plots of log(kNu/ks) are correlated by slopes of s = 0.78 and s = 0.73 for reactions of MeO-2+ and Me-2+, respectively. This shows that the sensitivity of bimolecular substitution at X-2+ to changes in nucleophile reactivity is smaller than for nucleophilic substitution at the methyl iodide.

Bio
Dr. Scott R. Swain is President and James Woodrow Hassell Professor of Systematic Theology at Reformed Theological Seminary in Orlando, Florida. Dr. Swain has served on the RTS faculty since 2006, having previously taught at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. 
His main research interests include the doctrine of God, theological interpretation of Scripture, and modern Protestant theology, and he has published a number of books and essays on these topics. With Dr. Michael Allen, he serves as general editor of two series: Zondervan Academic’s New Studies in Dogmatics and T & T Clark’s International Theological Commentary. 
Dr. Swain is an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church in America. He and his wife, Leigh, have four children. Dr. Swain blogs on a regular basis at Common Places.

Product Description
Can Christians and churches be both catholic and Reformed? In this volume, two accomplished young theologians argue that to be Reformed means to go deeper into true catholicity rather than away from it. Their manifesto for a catholic and Reformed approach to dogmatics seeks theological renewal through retrieval of the rich resources of the historic Christian tradition. The book provides a survey of recent approaches toward theological retrieval and offers a renewed exploration of the doctrine of sola scriptura. It includes a substantive afterword by J. Todd Billings.
