That property manager only ca...red about the place when the "managers" from the office was coming. They wanted everyone to have renter's insurance which is dumb. They did annual inspections as if they were a housing authority. I lived in Irvine before and Irvine company didn't do that.  There was a bug issue in the apartment. The gate was always broken even if they claim it was a gated community. When I left, they had all these stupid charges on my apartment. Stay away from any apartment that is managed by this company! 展开John DiCaprio · 2016年5月3日I was told I couldn't keep my propane heater on my patios so I moved it into my storage in the carport. Now I am told I can't not keep it in storage which I fin...d to be outrageous. If I can not store a propane heater on the premises I rent, Does that mean we can't store our camping equipment like a propane stove on the property? Does it mean maintenance can't have a propane torch to fix things? O could go on and on. I believe I am being picked on. When I moved in, the place was not ready to be rented. the paint was barely dry and cupboards and drawers were sticking. They painted the grates on the stove so the 1st time I used them, the place stunk like burning paint fumes... I had numerous complaints and the last straw was Termites and termite shit in my bathroom vanity. It took them 6 weeks to replace this unit and they didn't even do any spraying to rid the place of termites. The hot water barely works and it is always murky and on numerous occasions, it was shut off for the day. This is the first apartment I lived in in several years and can't wait until I can leave. The parking is horrible and the management isn't much better. I could go on and on but this thing with my propane heater has pissed me off and want to hear what they tell me I have to do with it. are we living in a communist community when we can't store and empty heater in a space I rent? If they had Zero as a rating, this place would get zero. 展开Carla Yanie · 2016年1月23日Never again would I deal with any complex that goes though Western National. The apartment complex my husband and I lived in for 2 years has been the worst expe...rience yet. The management is horrible, once you move out they take all your money. We left our  apartment spotless and they charged for new carpet (carpet was brand new when we moved in). They have a company go in and tell them "everything that needs to be done" and they just say OK. You don't think that company is just trying to make money? Of course, but what does MADERA apartments in Anaheim care? We were great tenants never late with rent. Not to mention our walk through was great - the guy that did it even told us everything was in great condition!!!! Believe me I have pictures... we were told that he doesn't know everything so WHY would someone that doesn't know do a walk through????? Unprofessional and incompetent people. Rant over. Attorney has looked over everything and will proceed with getting at least our  $390 that they charged us for new carpet. 展开Olga Sergeevna · 2015年5月22日I've lived in their apartment complex for 1 year and if anybody would ask me how my experience was in that complex, I'd say one word "horrible!" 1. They claimed... it was gated community. The only gate there was, it was for the parking lot. Anybody who wished could get in and out of the property without the key for the front gate. That's why my friend got his 3 tires and wheels stolen from the property between hours of 5-9 pm.  2. Homeless people just hang out at the property most of the nights. Oh and they had put their clothes in my washer and dryer afterwords to get some of their laundry done. 3. I had called the main office of western national property managements, I've spoke to the lady that had promised to resolve all the issues above and give me a call back the next day. That day has yet to come (I've called over 6 months ago). 4. When you are about to renew your lease agreement the prices go up by 15%-20%. 5. Once you move out they come up with ridiculous charges that they partially write off later. So don't even dream getting your deposit back. For me the ridiculous charges were: - carpet stretching ($60) - bleach stains on the carpet ($30). On my request to provide me with pictures of the damage I was told they didn't have the pictures and that they were going to try to write them off. Now 2 months later they got the pictures. Very interesting, isn't it?! Oh and it's important to mention that I've never in my life owned a bottle of bleach, so not sure where those stains came from. Also it takes them very long time to send you the bill but if you don't respond the same day, you will be sent to collections (for $30 in my case). Absolutely ridiculous. To sum up my experience I'd say "Do not ever move there under any circumstances!" 展开Bianca Banuelos · 2015年9月11日I really enjoy living at Pacific View Apts Everyone keeps to themselves and  yet are able to be friendly, accepting and polite. The staff in the leasing office,... maintenance, and housekeeping are the icing on the cake as they are everything I mentioned above in addition to being efficient and effective. I'm most thankful for Laurie in the office for taking charge and helping me through various requests from start to end. She really puts the home in pacific view apt homes long beach 展开Jennifer Daniels · 2016年6月15日I will never rent from a complex run by this company again. Quick to respond to my email about how sorry they were about my experience and then no follow through. They said someone would be calling me to follow up. I've been waiting on that call for a month now. Never again!Jennifer Bell · 2014年6月24日The quality of the staff at Birchwood Village Apartments in Brea in extremely poor.  Numerous errors and mistake have been made throughout my move in and living... experience at my expense with no remedy on their part.  I would not recommend this apartment complex or any other that Western National Property Management manages. 展开Joanne D'aranjo · 2014年8月3日I have been staying here for along time and each time the management changes, new rules on how we live and use our space when we pay the rent. They need to conc...entrate on fixing the parking issue which is a big problem as you pay but cannot park in the community and have to park on the road, I thought that it said that it is an open line between management and residents, totally not.  Dislike the management rules as it does not apply to all only some. 展开Elizabeth Lopez · 2015年6月8日Pool is closed. No notice was send out to tenants. In the club pacific apartment s complex.

Apartments for rent in California
One of the largest and most populous states in the country, California is full of notable cities, popular attractions, natural beauty and so much more. For those searching for California apartments for rent, you have hundreds of options to choose from.

Find a California apartment for rent in Sacramento, the Capital, or rent an apartment near the beautiful Pacific Ocean beaches in San Diego. Explore the vineyards of northern California, get caught up in the excitement of Disney Land, or experience the glitz of Hollywood. From the north to the south, you can find an apartment near great attractions, restaurants, shops and natural features in the state of California. 

Education is also a major attraction for California apartment residents. The University of California offers several campuses in San Diego, Berkeley, San Francisco, Los Angeles and more. University of Southern California, California State University and many other institutions provide excellent opportunities for higher education as well. 

California is a large state and covers a wide range of natural features including mountains, beaches, lakes, forests, state parks and rivers. These natural sites allow residents to experience a variety of outdoor activities including skiing, surfing, hiking, biking, fishing, swimming and more. And, known for its mild climate and beautiful seasons, California offers its apartment dwellers the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors all year long. Several popular parks and forests are spread across the state including the Mojave National Preserve, Death Valley National Park, Yosemite National Park and Lassen National Forest.

If you like sports and the outdoors, California won't disappoint. Whether you make it out to a game or watch it on TV in the comfort of your California apartment, you'll have a team to watch every season. The Angels, Dodgers and the A's provide MLB action in the spring and summer, and the Lakers offer basketball fans a team to cheer on. Hockey is also on hand with the Anaheim Ducks, and the Oakland Raiders offer entertainment on Sundays and Mondays. And with collegiate sports in addition to the professional teams, you'll be hard pressed to find time to keep up with all of California's sports.

If you find yourself California dreaming, start your apartment search on ApartmentGuide.com. Find detailed listings of California apartments for rent, explore neighborhoods and learn more about moving to your new apartment in the Moving Center on

Overview
Whether you're moving to California for a new job, a new tan or a new way of life, you're bound to find great apartments for rent and a Cali lifestyle that makes you want to shout the state motto, "Eureka!" (Greek for "I have found it").
What to Expect

California is a place of stark contrasts: The landscape runs the gamut from desert to ocean to mountain, green valleys to skyscrapers, sand to redwood forests, vineyards to office parks and everything in between. In the same day, if you're up for a drive, you can travel from hot, sandy Death Valley, the lowest point of the continental U.S., to cold, snowy Mount Whitney, the highest peak, with a stop in lush, gorgeous wine country along the way.
The diversity of the landscape and the lifestyle ensures a wide range of apartment rentals in various styles and price ranges. There truly is something for everyone in California, if you know what you want and you know where to look.
Where to Explore

While California offers many fine places to search for apartments, San Francisco and Los Angeles are two of the most popular cities to move to. Each city comprises diverse neighborhoods and attractions would fill several books—and has!—but here is a brief overview of what you'll find in these two unique cities:
San Francisco Apartments

The city by the bay, as San Francisco is known, is a cultural mecca famous for excellent restaurants, Victorian architecture, cable cars, rolling fog and the majestic Golden Gate Bridge. The city's expansive public transportation system makes it easy to get around without a car—a good thing, since parking can be difficult. Considering that the city is built on 43 hills, it's no wonder that the city streets are steep and curvy. If a spectacular view is what you're looking for, San Francisco's apartments have some of the finest.
San Francisco's numerous neighborhoods each have their own architecture and local flavor, and this often applies to their apartment rentals too: Many artists call Bernal Heights home. The gay-friendly Castro district hosts numerous cafes and an active nightlife. The Mission is traditionally known as the Latino quarter of the city and is home to artists and families. North Beach, famous for being the home of the Beat generation, is the city's Italian-American neighborhood&mdahs;and a great place to go for coffee. Cole Valley, near the historic Haight, features great restaurants and is popular among families and young professionals. Living in Pacific Heights means living near multi-million-dollar mansions and having great views of the bay.
Los Angeles Apartments

Despite what is depicted on TV, Los Angeles is more than just beaches, Beverly Hills and botoxed beauties. This large city is made up of dozens of varied communities and no true center, so you can create a lifestyle for yourself as rich as those you see in Hollywood movies. The one constant in this city, regardless of where you're looking for apartment rentals, is the need for a car. while there are buses and a subway system, a car is needed to enjoy all that the city has to offer.
The city's downtown is a growing area of lofts, luxury apartments and businesses, and is also home to many of the city's museums, theaters and historic landmarks. Hollywood defines the city for the millions of tourists who flock to the Walk of Fame and Mann's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. West Hollywood features the Sunset Strip, a stretch of Sunset Boulevard showcasing the city's hottest nightclubs and live-music venues, and is also the center of the city's gay and lesbian community. Family-friendly Santa Monica and funky, artsy Venice feature apartments looking out over popular beaches and the vast Pacific Ocean.
When you're looking for Los Angeles-area apartments for rent, don't forget about the San Fernando Valley, known as "The Valley" to locals. Valley girls and boys enjoy warmer temperatures and cheaper rents on apartments than in many other areas of the city, as well as a more suburban lifestyle. For a cross between the quiet neighborhoods of The Valley and the fun in the sun of a beach community, explore apartments in the South Bay, which includes Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach.
What to Evaluate

The diversity that these two cities offer will make you want to consider the kind of lifestyle that suits you best. While you look for apartments, keep in mind that rent ranges can vary drastically, depending on the area and type of environment you choose, so you may have to broaden your search to include more affordable options. Whichever area you choose, you're bound to find a way to make your California dreamin'. become a reality!Rent.com is a free rental site that offers a large selection of trusted apartments and houses for rent.

City Guide

Lake Forest
"Leave it all the fights and all / Summers getting colder / Drive all night to hold you tight / Back to California." (- Sugarcult, "Back to California")












"Leave it all the fights and all / Summers getting colder / Drive all night to hold you tight / Back to California." (- Sugarcult, "Back to California")
Lake Forest, or El Toro as it was originally known, is one of the few eco-friendly cities in the US. Packed with green parks, woodlands and its two man-made lakes, this city is a model on how to live in harmony with the environment. Lake Forest has managed, on its own, to bunch up about 78,439 people in the city, making it the 99th most populated area in California. Initially started as a gardening area and stagecoach stop between LA and San Diego, this city is home to the famous historical house, Serrano Adobe. With parks, history, and the California sunshine, Lake Forest is beckoning to you.






Moving to Lake Forest



Moving to Lake Forest
Given the low real estate vacancy rates in some neighborhoods, a realtor might come in handy if you want to move to Lake Forest. Some of them can foresee distressed landlords from a mile away. But the best place to start would be online listings because it is free and quite informative.Real estate rental costs in Lake Forest are among the highest in the nation; although certain cities beat it to the top of the renting order. Expect to pay way more than than the national average for a small condo, studio apartment or for a land hogging, residence.This neighborhood is season-proof. So dont expect to get landlords running to you during winter. The best advice would be to rent when the time comes for you to move. But it's always good to look ahead of time to ensure you have enough time to scout out as many places as possible before making the life-changing decision. Your relocation could be work related or even love related. Whatever the reason it is, it'll be a good excuse to move to Lake Forest.It's always been said that nothing last like first impressions when it comes to meeting people for the first time. And it isn't different when it comes to meeting landlords -- they are people too! So if you want to rent a house, arm yourself with anything that will speak in your favor. For example, a good credit report will show a landlord that you're fiscally responsible. So will your latest paycheck, employer’s letter, etc. Also try to get as much details about the property you seek to rent from your landlord. For example, is there a pet policy that will force you to send Clifford or Garfield away? A referral letter from you current landlord will also help you in case you are competing for the same house with another annoying potential renter.




Lake Forest Neighborhoods



Lake Forest Neighborhoods
One’s options are numerous when it comes to renting a place in Lake Forest. You can find a townhouse, luxury condo, and even a retirement home if you want. Below are some of the main neighborhoods in this city.Foothill Ranch: This suburban neighborhood is loved by executives, so expect to part with a good chunk of change each month. The housing style here is majorly medium-sized family homes. The real estate vacancy rate here stands at 6.9% at the moment, so there is hope as long as you have the cash. This place is also commuter-friendly with the average commute to work taking about 30 nonredeemable minutes.El Toro Rd Area: The average home in this metropolitan neighborhood is ideal for families. Home vacancy rate stands at 6.3%, so don’t worry about finding a place. It’s the rent that should concern you. However, due to its popularity amongst university students, expect the vacancy rate to fluctuate along with the school calendar. The typical commuting time in this neighborhood for the working class is about half an hour on the higher side. Jeronimo Rd Area: Average rental rates in Jeronimo Rd and nearby Lake Forest Drive presently tops the charts here. If you have to stay at par with the Jones', no matter what, then this is it. With this kind of rent expect palatial homes and a vacancy rate that is wait for it 0.0%. Commuting takes 30 minutes to work and most people do it alone in their cars. Town Hall: This is another locale that is not soft on the pocket. But with a vacancy rate of 0.0%, perhaps youre better off checking back in two months' time--or not at all if the price isn't right. Commuting to work mostly done alone driving takes about half an hour. So arriving to work late requires a pretty good excuse. El Toro R/Portola Pky: Average rental costs in this urban enclave are relatively pocket-friendly. The vacancy rate at a friendly 8.7% makes this neighborhood quite tempting to those on a tighter budget. Expect to bump into mostly small to medium sized apartment complexes. Commuters here often invest around 30 minutes driving to work.Glenn Ranch Rd: This area is home to mostly medium-sized single family homes. With the affordable rents here, you will settle in just fine.

Methodology - Recent Updates:
Data from private listing sites, including our own, tends to skew toward luxury apartments, which introduces sample bias when estimates are calculated directly from these listings. To address these limitations, we’ve recently made major updates to our methodology, which we believe have greatly improved the accuracy and reliability of our estimates.
Read more about our new methodology below, or see a more detailed post here.
Methodology:
Apartment List is committed to making our rent estimates the best and most accurate available. To do this, we start with reliable median rent statistics from the Census Bureau, then extrapolate them forward to the current month using a growth rate calculated from our listing data. In doing so, we use a same-unit analysis similar to Case-Shiller’s approach, comparing only units that are available across both time periods to provide an accurate picture of rent growth in cities across the country.
Our approach corrects for the sample bias inherent in other private sources, producing results that are much closer to statistics published by the Census Bureau and HUD. Our methodology also allows us to construct a picture of rent growth over an extended period of time, with estimates that are updated each month.
Read more about our methodology here.
About Rent Reports:
Apartment List publishes monthly reports on rental trends for hundreds of cities across the U.S. We intend these reports to be a source of reliable information that help renters and policymakers make sound decisions, and we invest significant time and effort in gathering and analyzing rent data. Our work is covered regularly by journalists across the country.
We are continuously working to improve our methodology and data, with the goal of providing renters with the information that they need to make the best decisions.

The established residential community of Lake Forest in Lake Oswego, Oregon, lies eight miles south of downtown Portland. Popular apartment rentals include those located in the north of the area close to Interstate 5 that connects Washington to California.

For shopping, drive a few miles outside the area to Bridgeport Village, or the sizeable Washington Square shopping mall with upscale chains, specialty stores, and restaurants. Closer to home, the area south of Boones Ferry Road includes Zupan’s Markets deli and grocery and La Provence Boulangerie and Patisserie, where locals can buy bread and pastries as well as enjoy brunch or dinner. La Provence's smoked salmon benedict is a firm favorite. Another popular dining venue, Oswego Grill, which specializes in grilled fish and meats, lies north of Kruse Way.

If you enjoy outdoor activities, visit Waluga Park West and East for nature trails, walking paths, covered picnic areas, and baseball fields. In warmer summer months, travel westwards to Millennium Plaza Park to enjoy live concerts and visit the weekly Lake Oswego Farmers Market.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
