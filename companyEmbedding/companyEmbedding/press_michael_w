Liturgical Press Suggests



Winner of the 2015 Templeton Prize and numerous other international and prestigious honors, Jean Vanier lives a radical poverty of surrender in a time of fanatical acquisitiveness, economic disparity, and mounting bellicosity among nations. He is a philosopher of the heart, icon of wholeness, and justice activist. 	Through such key notions as trust, community, relationship, and humility, Vanier has built up a network of service and nurturing growth spanning the globe: the L'Arche Movement. He has advocated for peace in a world that treasures its violence, written extensively about the very meaning of human personhood, and championed sensitivity to the diverse spiritual traditions that make up our world. His remarkable life has included rich friendships with Blessed Mother Teresa, St. John Paul II and Henri Nouwen.	Jean Vanier is a man of complexity and formal philosophical training, a scion of a family of national pedigree, and one of the seminal religious and inspirational figures of our time. In this volume, Michael Higgins focuses on Vanier's many interconnections—personal and conceptual—with the mighty and the humble, the pious and the secular, as well as the young and the seasoned.Michael W. Higgins is vice-president for Mission and Catholic Identity at Sacred Heart University, past president of St. Jerome's University in Ontario and St. Thomas University in New Brunswick, a columnist, editor, radio documentarist, and television commentator. He is the author and co-author of numerous books, including Thomas Merton: Faithful Visionary (published by Liturgical Press); Power and Peril: The Catholic Church at the Crossroads; Stalking the Holy: In Pursuit of Saint-Making; and Genius Born of Anguish-the Life and Legacy of Henri Nouwen.Visit PeopleofGodBooks.org to explore more of the books in this engaging series. You'll find author interviews, videos, reading group materials, and more!


Michael Higgins has understood the heart of Jean Vanier. He knows how to touch ours. He writes serenely about Vanier's life-changing work among the disabled and the destitute. In writing so he shows how they can change our hearts as well. His book is seriously engaging.Jacques Monet, SJ, Director of the Canadian Institute of Jesuit Studies  
This biography offers a perceptive account of Jean Vanier's life and thought. It is beautifully written and communicates to the reader the spiritual complexity of this remarkable man of faith. Special in Higgins' account is, in my opinion, his presentation of Vanier's life in its historical context-that is to say, in the decades before and after the Second Vatican Council, a span of time in which the Church opened itself to a new relationship to the world.theologian Gregory Baum in The Ecumenist 
This is a brilliant exposition of an extraordinary man and the many influences that have shaped him and his prophetic vision. Higgins has entered deeply into Vanier's life story and presents it with fascinating detail. I have known Vanier and been involved with his L'Arche communities since the mid-sixties but every chapter of this beautiful book reveals to me new dimensions of both the man and his life work.Bill Clarke, SJ, Spiritual Director, Ignatius Jesuit Centre, Guelph, Ontario  
Michael Higgin's Jean Vanier: Logician of the Heart is an eloquent and moving meditation on what it means to be truly human in a "throwaway" culture where competition, corporate greed and inequality reign supreme. Vanier's work among the physically and intellectually vulnerable reveals the cost and joy of radical love. By emphasizing our common frailty and the openness and capacity of the disabled to allow Jesus to find repose in their hearts-he challenges us to enflesh tenderness in our own lives, become "God's refuge" in a largely uncaring world. A book to be treasured and reread.James Clarke, poet, judge, author of L'Arche Journal: A Family's Experience in Jean Vanier's Community 
Since 1964, Jean Vanier and many friends, with and without intellectual disabilities, have lived in community together. These international communities of L'Arche, and Faith and Light, show that peace on earth and goodwill among all people is possible. Michael Higgins brings his characteristic enthusiasm and wide-ranging cultural interests to this personal interpretation of the life and legacy of Jean Vanier.Carolyn Whitney-Brown, PhD, editor of Jean Vanier: Essential Writings 
Jean Vanier has for many years been a quiet, strange, unsettling voice of vulnerability and tenderness amid the clatter and anxiety of our age. He helps us make peace with our brokenness, and gently redirects us away from the exhausting and fatuous search for perfection and towards the embrace of humility. No-one knows the character and the hinterland better, or can approach them with more sensitivity and sureness of touch, than Michael W Higgins.Brendan Walsh, The Tablet

New Album Official Press Release


Sovereign marks Smith’s first studio worship album since 2008

Sovereign Deluxe Edition to include DVD concert with
special appearances by Kari Jobe and Leeland Mooring


Nashville, Tenn. (March 20, 2014) – After selling more than 15 million albums, scoring 28 No. 1 hits, earning three GRAMMY® Awards and more than 40 Dove Awards, musical icon Michael W. Smith will open a new chapter in his career on May 13 as he releasesSovereign, his first studio worship album since 2008 and his first album with new label partner Sparrow Records and Capitol Christian Music Group. Sovereign will also be available as a Deluxe Edition, which will include a special DVD concert filmed at Smith’s barn in Franklin, Tenn. and will feature guest appearances from Kari Jobe and Leeland Mooring. The DVD will also include special behind the scenes footage and content with Smith discussing the inspiration behind Sovereign.

Well known as one of the most gifted artists and worship leaders of his generation, Smith’s previous worship projects have sold well over 3.5 million albums. Throughout the entirety of his career, Smith’s albums have received one Double Platinum, seven Platinum and 16 Gold RIAA Certifications. However, not one to rest on past success as he hits the “sweet spot” of his career, Smith is deliberately entering a new creative chapter on Sovereign, crafting a vibrant collection of vertically-focused songs with a fresh sense of musical innovation.

“I’m enjoying making music more than I ever have in my entire life,” Smith exudes. “I’m having fun and I’m excited about this record and this next chapter.”

In the spirit of this new adventure, Smith enlisted the talents of several songwriters and producers he hasn’t collaborated with previously for Sovereign, including Seth Moseley (Newsboys, Sanctus Real, Love & the Outcome) and Kyle Lee (Natalie Grant). Smith also tapped the expertise of producers Chris Stevens (TobyMac, Carrie Underwood, Mandisa) and West Coast-based writer/producer Jeremy Edwardson (Kari Jobe, Jesus Culture). Bridging the gap between a generation of worship leaders, Smith brought in one of his favorite singers, Kari Jobe, to sing on a track.

“You Won’t Let Go,” the first single from Sovereign, has quickly become a staple in Smith’s live shows. The song has also given Smith a triumphant reentry to Christian radio where it was immediately the most added at Christian AC, and currently sits at No. 22 on the National Christian Audience chart. The lyric video for the track can be seen herehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRb_NIQTzyA.

            I have purchased the Michael W. Smith CD 'Worship' and it was just beautiful and wonderfully orchestrated.  However; this CD was just not done with the same priorities and professional artists.  I was really disappointed to hear one section of 'talking' and too many sections with children singing.  I believe I counted a total of four songs that fell into what I was hoping for in a worship CD by  Michael W. Smith.  I  will pay much more attention in the future and try U-tube prior to purchase to make sure I do not waste my money.

            The CD arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged. It played flawlessly on my system with no distortion or need to play with the equalizer. Technically, a perfect CD. The style of music was not quite what I was expecting.

Featured Music- Hills and Valleys- Tauren Wells More
Michigan native Tauren Wells started his music career at Indiana Bible College, forming the group Royal Tailor with a trio of classmate friends.

After landing a key spot in the multi-million-view Dude Perfect series with his "Undefeated" KB collaboration, Wells returns with a full length collection of electrifying pop-rock anthems and heartfelt songs of faith.  Read More

You can glide effortlessly from passage to passage with insightful commentary, or view cross-references without leaving the Scripture you’re studying. Read through the Bible in a year, and dig in wherever you want with the Faithlife Study Bible. Incredible!

Evangelical Exegetical Commentary Series

Editors: H. Wayne House, William D. Barrick, W. Hall Harris III, and Andrew W. Pitts
Publisher: Lexham Press

The Evangelical Exegetical Commentary is a brand new series written from a distinctly evangelical perspective which incorporates the latest critical biblical scholarship. Published by Lexham Press, this set includes the first ten volumes of the projected 44-volume EEC. The publication of the EEC marks the first time a major Bible commentary series has been published in digital form before its print counterpart—and the first time it has been designed with a digital format in mind.

Lexham Discourse Hebrew Bible

Editors: Steven Runge and Joshua R. Westbury
Publisher: Lexham Press
Volumes: 6





A first for Old Testament studies, the Lexham Discourse Hebrew Bible visually presents the discourse and communicative functions of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament. This makes it possible for the reader to quickly and easily recognize how the Old Testament authors structured their message and what elements they considered most important in their clauses, sentences, and paragraphs. This ability to recognize the priorities of Old Testament authors in their writing has significant implications for students writing papers, pastors preparing sermons, and scholars studying the Hebrew text.







Lexham Discourse Greek New Testament

Editors: Steven Runge
Publisher: Lexham Press
Volumes: 6





With the Lexham Discourse Greek New Testament, we can now get behind the words of the New Testament writers and discover the particular linguistic tasks that inform translation and interpretation. The Lexham Discourse Greek New Testament identifies discourse markers and performs complex discourse analysis of the entire New Testament quickly, easily, and accurately, which makes it one of the most advanced tools for studying the Greek text of the New Testament.







Spurgeon Commentary Series

Editors: Elliot Ritzema, Jessi Strong, Carrie Sinclair Wolcott
Publisher: Lexham Press
Volumes: 10





The Spurgeon Commentary Series makes Charles Spurgeon’s content accessible—there is no longer a need to comb through many volumes of Spurgeon’s content looking for one nugget of wisdom. Spurgeon’s writings are now curated in a format that is tied to the biblical text. Spurgeon’s writings on the Bible fill dozens of volumes—his thoughts on particular passages scattered in numerous books and sermons. These volumes collect his thoughts on ten different New Testament letters in a commentary format, with illustrations and applications culled from his sermons and writings.


Featured Titles:

Galatians
Philippians
Hebrews
1 Peter
1 John

Brain Development
Normal Processes and the Effects of Alcohol and Nicotine
Edited by Michael W. Miller


 -Includes unique coverage--normal neural development, effects of alcohol, and effects of nicotine. 
 -Highlights the clinical importance of nicotine and alcohol. 
 -Alcohol is the most thoroughly understood developmental toxin, and this book is the most detailed description of its effects on the developing brain. 
 -Developmental consequences of nicotine are poorly understood, but this book sheds light on them. 
 -Extensive literature reviews and citations make the book useful as a reference work for researchers studying normal and abnormal brain development. 








Brain Development
Normal Processes and the Effects of Alcohol and Nicotine
Edited by Michael W. Miller



Description



This is the first book about both normal development of the nervous system and how early exposure to alcohol and nicotine interferes with this development. The developing nervous system is highly dynamic and vulnerable to genetic and epigenetic factors that can be additive or synergistic. Disruption of normal brain development leads to an array of developmental disorders. One of the most common of these is mental retardation, the prime cause of which is prenatal exposure to alcohol. As chapters in this book show, alcohol has direct effects on the developing neural system and it affects genetic regulation. Another common neurotoxin is nicotine, and it is discussed in this book for three reasons: (1) the number of adolescents who smoke cigarettes is rising in some populations; (2) prenatal exposure to nicotine affects neurotransmitter systems that are critical for normal brain development and cognition; and (3) prenatal exposure to nicotine is often accompanied by prenatal exposure to alcohol.LThe mature brain is the culmination of an orderly sequence of the basic ontogenetic processes--cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and death. Neural stem cells and progenitors proliferate in discrete sites; then, young neurons migrate long distances to their residences where they form neural networks. During this sequence many immature cells die, presumably eliminating unsuitable or non-competitive cells. Each process is regulated by genetic and environmental factors. When this regulation goes awry, a dysmorphic and dysfunctional brain results. Though this can be tragic in clinical settings, in experimental contexts it provides keen insight into normal brain development.LThe book is divided into three parts. The first describes neural ontogeny in the normal brain. The second and third deal with the consequences of early exposure to alcohol and nicotine. Though there are similarities in the effects of these two toxins, there are also intriguing differences. The commonalities reflect the plasticity and resilience of the developing brain while the differences point to the targeted effects of the two toxins. Exploring these effects brings a richer appreciation of brain development. The book will be of interest to neuroscientists, developmental biologists, teratologists, pharmacologists, toxicologists, neurologists, neuropsychologists, and to their students and trainees.

        Founded in 1903, Ford Motor Company has enormously impacted the history and development of America, and the world, in the 20th century. What began as a small operation in a converted Detroit wagon factory has become the second largest industrial manufacturing corporation in the world, with active operations on six continents. Unlike other automotive corporations, the Ford company has remained under the control and active management of its founding family for 100 years. Like the Kennedys, Vanderbilts, and Roosevelts, the Ford family has made an irreversible impact on American history and society. Through a collection of over 200 images, Ford Dynasty tells the story of one extraordinary American family, their company, and its accomplishments over the course of a century.

Description

Authors/Editors



“Is it the intention of law-makers that good men shall be hung ever?” asked Henry David Thoreau. The question has never been academic, but in 1924, when Herman Melville’s Billy Budd, Sailor was published posthumously, we understood better than ever why. An uneasy if beautiful account of the human cost of realpolitik, Billy Budd, Sailor asks how far we should go to protect the status quo. When does the reaction to a security crisis become reactionary? In the novella John Claggart, master-at-arms of a British warship, alleges a sailor is talking mutiny. The sailor, Billy, isn’t just innocent of the charge; he’s a true innocent. Yet when confronted by his accuser, Billy reacts impulsively, striking Claggart. The resulting trial shows the horrors that can follow from a civilized society following its own laws.

This Broadview Edition is based on the authoritative Hayford-Sealts copy-text of Billy Budd. The introduction distills the long and complex critical conversation about the work since its publication, and the historical appendices feature materials on mutiny, capital and corporal punishment, philosophical pessimism, sexuality, and the rule of law.

Comments
 “This is the most teachable edition of Billy Budd available. It lucidly situates Melville’s novella within its legal, literary, and historical contexts, providing a variety of compelling ways to approach the text. Michael J. Everton’s introduction is also incisive and engaging. This edition is an impressive achievement.” —Cody Marrs, University of Georgia

“Michael J. Everton and Broadview Press have produced an excellent new edition of an important book. Everton’s beautiful introduction and thoughtful notes provide the reader with a rich sense of the historical contexts and literary references essential to Melville’s seminal meditation on justice and law. This edition also helpfully includes a comprehensive bibliography.” —Gregg Crane, University of Michigan
