You are here Working With ACM What to Expect

Web
Site

 









What to Expect



The first step would be to hold a confidential, no-cost consultation.
We are willing to meet with qualified prospects for our Private Client Group.
You are a qualified prospect if you:

 Have the desire and ability to delegate your investment management and
    wealth planning needs. 
 Have reasonable expectations of the financial market’s ability
    to meet your goals. 
 Have a minimum portfolio value of $500,000. 

 A preliminary phone conversation would be helpful to discuss an agenda
for the consultation. You would then receive a brief, 3-page preliminary
financial profile. Once the completed profile is received back at our office
we will be prepared to consult with you more specifically for your situation,
rather than in generalizations. 
 The initial consultation is an informational meeting. You would meet with
one of our firm's advisors. It is not
appropriate for you or us to make any “on the spot” decisions.
You will want to gather information about us to evaluate if we can help you.
We will want to learn more about your financial concerns, goals, dreams,
values, etc. 

 Following the initial consultation, both parties should spend some time
considering if it is appropriate to proceed to the next step. The advisor(s) you met with will send you a letter summarizing the main points discussed
during your consultation. If we strongly believe our wealth management services
can help you minimize your financial concerns and accomplish your important
goals and values, we will send you a proposal detailing how we may begin
working together. At that point, we would like to get your assessment of
the situation and discuss the possibility of proceeding to the next step. 
 When we first begin working together, we will collaborate and establish an appropriate
asset allocation model (from aggressive, moderate, conservative, etc.) based on your personal situation. You will understand and agree with the general asset allocation
model used to manage your portfolio. 
We will also have prepared for you
any account documents necessary for us to begin managing your investment
portfolio. Although we will consider managing your assets at the current
custodians holding them, we have a preferred custodian in Charles Schwab.  In most cases, it will be necessary to transfer your
assets to Charles Schwab. We would prepare any necessary brokerage
account and asset transfer documents for you. 
 As we begin the day-to-day management of your assets, we will evaluate
your current holdings and begin to transition your portfolio into your asset
allocation model. Your advisor will be in communication with you periodically. 
 We would like to hold a meeting with you at the 45-day mark into our relationship.
At this meeting we will review the current market conditions, discuss appropriate
investment strategies and review the initial investments we made on your
behalf.  We will also review with you an example of the quarterly investment report you will receive at the end of each calendar quarter. The intention of this meeting is to ensure our relationship
gets off on the right foot. 
 Following the 45-Day meeting, we would like to meet with you after 3 months, then semiannual meetings until you are comfortable with our relationship. Long-term clients typically meet with us in a regular semiannual or annual interval, which is held face-to-face or via phone/online meeting options. During the review meetings, you will meet with your advisor and possibly other members of our team. Your advisor will provide you an in-depth analysis of current capital market conditions, discuss our investment strategies and review your portfolio allocation in accordance with the prevailing conditions.. 
 When a transaction is made in your account, the custodian holding your
account will provide trade confirmations to you. When making
important changes to your portfolio allocation, we will send you a  Flash
Report. The report will
provide a rationale for the portfolio management decisions made and any resulting transactions in any of your accounts under our management. The transactions can be further discussed with your advisor on the phone or during your next review meeting. Of course, you also receive our insightful
PAAS Weekly Updates, which summarizes our thoughts
on market and economic conditions as well as status of our models used to manage your portfolio. 
You will receive a periodic statement (typically monthly) from the custodian
holding your assets. The statements will summarize the activity and holdings for each
account you have with the custodian. You will receive a comprehensive quarterly
report from our office. The quarterly report will include your current
asset allocation, a list of positions held, performance for the period and
other valuable information. We can also create these statements ‘on
demand’, whenever you would like to see one. 
 In the end, you could expect that: 
 …you are making more informed and disciplined investments.
 …your investments are more focused and based on current market conditions
and your goals and values.  
 …you have more clarity with your financial position.
 …you have less stress over your investments and are receiving an enriching service.

All firm employees subject to this Code are required to exhibit high ethical standards, and must always place client interests ahead of their own.  All firm employees subject to this Code must comply with all applicable laws related to the firm’s business.  Failure to do so may expose you to civil and/or criminal action by regulators, as well as suspension or termination from this firm.

In addition, all firm employees are bound by the Anti-Fraud Provisions of federal securities law.  As such, the firm and its employees may not:

• Engage in any manipulative act or practice with respect to a client or prospective client

As a Fiduciary, you are required to place your client’s interests before those of the firm, its employees or affiliates, or yourself.  Your Fiduciary duties include:

• Making recommendations that are suitable for clients considering individual client needs, financial circumstances, and investment objectives
• Treating all clients fairly and equitably
• Exercising a high degree of care to ensure truthful representations about investments and recommendations presented to client
• Fully disclosing all material facts about investments or recommendations


In addition, all firm employees are specifically prohibited from the following:

1) Placing the firms, any firm employee, or your own, security orders “in front of” client orders to buy or sell securities, thereby receiving a better price than the client (“Front-Running”).
2) Buying or selling based on insider information, or disseminating any insider information.
3) Holding customer funds or securities or acting as custodian for client accounts, securities, money or other property.
4) Transacting or soliciting advisory business in any jurisdiction without proper registration or exemption from registration.
5) Borrowing money or securities from any client.
6) Accepting any cash or checks made out to you, or commingling a client’s funds with your own.
7) Maintaining a joint bank or securities account with any client, or sharing any benefit or loss with a client.

9) Acting as an IAR for any other firm without prior firm approval.
10) Giving advice or effecting transactions which are not suitable for the client.
11) Guaranteeing the present or future value of any security, or guaranteeing that the projected results or tax benefits of any advice will be achieved.
12) Placing an order to purchase or sell a security for the account of a client upon instruction of a third party without first obtaining a third party trading authorization from the client.
13) Inducing trading in a client’s account that is excessive in size or frequency in view of the financial resources and character of the account (“Churning”).
14) Disclosing to third parties any information received from a client, including a client’s name, unless obligated to do so by law or unless written permission from the client is obtained prior to providing the information, in accordance with the firm’s Privacy Policy.
15) Signing a client or prospective clients name to any document.
16) Falsely stating or misrepresenting your credentials.
17) Representing or implying in any manner whatsoever that you have been ‘sponsored’, ‘recommended’, or ‘approved’, or that any firm product or advice has been ‘sponsored’, ‘recommended, or ‘approved’, by the United States Government or by any agency or regulatory body.




Employee Securities Holdings and Transaction Reports

All firm employees, both registered and non-registered, full and part time, are required to report both their personal securities transactions and their personal securities holdings for review by the firm’s Chief Compliance Officer.  

Holdings reports are due within 30 days of year end (January 30).  The holdings report must contain, at minimum:

• The title and type of security, and as applicable the exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, number of shares, and principal amount of each reportable security in which you have any direct or indirect beneficial ownership
• The name or any broker, dealer, or bank with which you maintain an account in which any securities are held for your direct or indirect benefit
• The date that the Holding Report is being submitted to the firm

Holdings reports for new employees are due within ten business days of your effective date of employment, and the report submitted must be current as of a date not more than 45 days prior to your date of employment. 

Transaction Reports are due quarterly within 30 days of the end of each quarter (due dates are January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30), and the information contained in the reports must cover all transactions for that quarter.   Transaction reports must contain, at minimum:

• The date of the transaction, the title, and as applicable the exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, interest rate and maturity date, number of shares, and principal amount of each reportable security involved
• The nature of the transaction (purchase, sale, or other acquisition/distribution)
• The price at which the transaction was effected
• The name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through which the transaction was effected
• The date that the Transaction Report is being submitted to the firm

The Holding and Transaction reports are reviewed by the Chief Compliance Officer.  All reports are signed and dated by the Chief Compliance Officer to evidence his review, and are maintained in a Reports file.  The Chief Compliance Officer, in reviewing the reports, will look for any transactions that run counter to clients best interests, will review to detect for ‘front running’, and will review to insure that, for those transactions requiring them, the employee received ‘pre-clearance’.

Due to the firm’s minimal size, in lieu of holdings and transaction reports, brokerage statements may be provided for compliance purposes. 



Pre-Clearance For Certain Transactions

All firm employees are required to receive written approval from the Chief Compliance Officer before you directly or indirectly acquire beneficial ownership in any security in an initial public offering (I.P.O.) or in a limited offering.  This includes all Private Placement offerings.  

You must, in writing, provide information about the proposed transaction in the I.P.O. or limited offering to the Compliance Officer, including the proposed amount of the acquisition, and must disclose any relationship that you have with any party to the transaction.  If approved by the Compliance Officer, you will receive a written approval letter, a copy of which will be maintained with your request letter in your employee file.



Violations and Employee Review

All firm employees subject to this Code of Ethics are required to immediately report to the Chief Compliance Officer any violation of the Code of Ethics that they know about or come to know about.  

The Chief Compliance Officer will review the Code of Ethics on an annual basis to ensure that the Code meets all regulatory and legal requirements. Copies of the Code of Ethics will be maintained for five years in the firm’s “Code of Ethics” file. 

In addition, all firm employees subject to the Code are required to review the Code annually (or at the time of any amendment being made to the Code).  An Attestation stating that the employee has received and reviewed the Code will be collected by the Chief Compliance Officer on an annual basis (or at the time of amendment), and will be maintained in the “Code of Ethics” file for a period of five years.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
