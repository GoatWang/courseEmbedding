Barron’s 2017 Best Online Broker Ranking
Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...

Fidelity Management Trust Company Inc. Key Developments

Judge Dismisses ERISA Suit against Fidelity Stable Value Decisions
Jun 22 17
The suit accused the firm of engaging in imprudent investment strategies for the Fidelity Group Employee Benefit Plan Managed Income Portfolio Commingled Pool (MIP). A judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts this week dismissed an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) lawsuit filed against Fidelity Management Trust Company over the management and monitoring of a stable value fund offered to 401(k) plans. The suit, Ellis vs. Fidelity Management Trust Co., accused Fidelity of engaging in imprudent investment strategies for the Fidelity Group Employee Benefit Plan Managed Income Portfolio Commingled Pool (MIP), a stable value fund offered as an investment option in some 401(k) plans for which Fidelity was trustee. The weak performance and high fees of the MIP were the result of the intentional actions and omissions of Fidelity as trustee of the plans, the suit alleged. Fidelity delegated day-to-day management of the MIP to its affiliate, Fidelity Management and Research Company, and the lawsuit accused Fidelity of failing to continuously monitor and supervise its affiliate. Among other issues, plaintiffs claimed this lack of prudence and monitoring resulted in the stable value fund purchasing excessive wrap insurance that unnecessarily dampened return prospects and resulted in conflicts of interest. The text of the court's decision goes into significant detail about the investment and monitoring process Fidelity used in managing the stable value fund in question. The plaintiffs had argued that Fidelity acted in its own self-interest by agreeing to overly stringent wrap insurance guidelines that sacrificed the competitiveness of the portfolio, while allowing Fidelity to grow its assets under management.


Fidelity Management Trust Company Faces ERISA Lawsuit over Stable Value Fund
Dec 21 15
A recently filed lawsuit accuses Fidelity Management Trust Company of engaging in imprudent investment strategies for the Fidelity Group Employee Benefit Plan Managed Income Portfolio Commingled Pool (MIP), a stable value fund offered as an investment option in some 401(k) plans trusteed by Fidelity. According to the lawsuit, during a specified class period, the MIP had such low investment returns and high fees that it was an imprudent retirement plan investment. The poor performance and high fees of the MIP were the result of the intentional actions and omissions of Fidelity as trustee of the plans, the suit alleges. Fidelity delegated day-to-day management of the MIP to its affiliate, Fidelity Management and Research Company, and the lawsuit accuses Fidelity of failing to continuously monitor and supervise its affiliate. The compliant says that prior to 2009, Fidelity engaged in an imprudent investment strategy for the MIP that caused substantial losses to the fund and accordingly exposed itself and the MIP's 'wrap providers' to substantial losses. Faced with a substantial decline in the MIP's market value, and with resulting pressure from the wrap providers-which were exposed to liability in the event of significant MIP fund withdrawals-Fidelity responded by adopting an unduly conservative investment strategy that was contrary to the purposes of stable value fund investing, agreeing to allow the wrap providers to charge excessive fees, and charging excessive fees for its own account. According to the compliant, in addition to its fiduciary breach under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), Fidelity also attempted to conceal its improperly conservative investment and excessive fees from investors by solely reporting to investors an inappropriate 'money market' benchmark for the MIP rather than a proper stable value fund benchmark that made the MIP returns appear to be competitive. The lawsuit contends that competing stable value funds which were subject to the exact same underlying economic conditions as the MIP and had the same conservative investment goals earned substantially higher returns than the MIP during the relevant time period while at the same time preserving principal, ensuring liquidity, and providing stable returns.

Will there be tax consequences when I open my account?  

Partnering with you to help manage your money in a tax-efficient way starts with getting your account set up with the right mix of investments. This process may require selling some investments that generate taxable gains. However, the result is an account that we believe will be better positioned to provide opportunities for growth while managing potential investment risks.



Can I choose a different strategy than what is suggested?  

You can opt to select a different strategy than what is suggested during our planning discussions. We will manage your account according to your selected investment strategy.

          1. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques (including tax-loss harvesting) on a limited basis, at their discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client’s account should be bought or sold. With this discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor’s account that Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios do not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    

          2.
	
	
	       
					Please note that you will be charged an additional fee for any SMAs held in your account. These fees are in addition to the basic advisory fees for Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios. Please refer to your Client Agreement for detailed fee information.


          3. The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through broker-dealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected.
	
    

          4. Fidelity Personal Trust refers to trust services that are offered through Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB (FPTC), a federal savings bank.
	
    

Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.

			Whether selecting Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB, (FPTC)1 as your trustee or investment manager for assets held in a trust, you put to work a team of professionals who are committed to adding value to your trust.
		








 Help preserve wealth for future generations 
Consider using FPTC if you would like help transferring $200,000 or more to your family or other beneficiary through a trust; or, if you would like to potentially avoid probate—the legal process of distributing wealth after death—to maintain privacy and minimize estate-related costs.
If you decide to name FPTC as your trustee or co-trustee, we offer objectivity, continuity, and experience in trust administration. As part of our fiduciary services, we will:

Administer the trust according to its terms.
Communicate regularly with beneficiaries.
Prepare required records, statements, and tax returns.

Whether you name us as trustee or prefer to name another in this capacity, you’ll also receive the same tax-sensitive investment management2 as with Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios.
A dedicated trust officer will be assigned to all accounts for which FPTC serves as trustee or co-trustee. A dedicated portfolio specialist will be assigned to all other Fidelity® Personalized Portfolio accounts.










Next steps

To open an account, start by telling us your financial needs and goals. We’ll send you a complimentary investment proposal.
