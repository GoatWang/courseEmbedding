MediaHound - The Entertainment Graph






































MediaHound LogoHamburger IconLoginOur AppsCaret Down IconIcon HeartDateNight TextIcon NextQueue>NextQueue TextIcon SearchFindMedia TextStar IconText for Our AwardsThe Entertainment Graph IconThe Entertainment Graph TextDeveloper IconDevelopersContact IconContact UsView our FacebookView our TwitterThe Entertainment GraphEntertainment is an exciting and dynamic ecosystem. New movies, books, TV shows, songs, books, games, and videos are created all the time. The professional production and distribution of entertainment has exploded in the digital era, as new ways of delivering content spur change and acceleration.But explosions, even beautiful ones, can cause fracturing.At MediaHound, we love the digital content revolution and we build technologies that solve the problems it inevitably causes for consumers, businesses, and brands. People come to the content revolution with different perspectives: the consumer who wants to find and enjoy entertainment in a variety of old and emerging ways, a friend suggesting content to a heterogeneous network of followers, the student trying to understand the way our civilization changes in this digital media landscape, the creative person trying to understand where his or her own work fits in as well, the executive trying to track an emerging trend or elucidate a new message by connecting it with a timeless truth, the marketer looking for a new audience to reach or a new association for a brand, and even the curious onlooker who wants to join the conversation. Like our own universe, the galaxies of content are expanding faster than we can understand them. To truly know all of the content that exists and where we stand in relationship to it, we would need a universal content tracking system. An intelligent, automatically updated GPS with encyclopedic coverage of all content, the people who create it, and the fans who consume, discuss, or curate that content.MediaHound makes that GPS. It’s called The Entertainment Graph. Leveraging Neo4j, the leading graph database, and other complimentary technologies, we create a unique identifier for every piece of entertainment content and connect it with all the related content, people, concepts, tags, sentiments, sources, and metadata. This accurate database of metadata and availability information automatically updates, constantly filling in the information gaps that have occurred naturally as both the business and craft of entertainment have changed.The Entertainment Graph powers apps that help people search for, share, and discover movies, books, games, shows, and music across all devices, formats, and legal distribution services. It also creates an environment for exploration and insight. By navigating the graph and examining the connections between its nodes, we come to understand the way people express ideas over time through words, images, sounds, and experiences. Genres, trends, careers, and periods are all illustrated in The Entertainment Graph. Real people enrich this data with their reactions, emotions, reviews, descriptions, and taxonomies. Along the way, MediaHound users develop a complete and permanent taste profile that allows them to make and receive better recommendations.As a company, our plan is to use this platform to deliver the best consumer applications possible. These MediaHound applications are built on The Entertainment Graph and will allow people to manipulate the data through an intuitive, delightful experience so they can benefit from its depth and breadth. Over time we will also tap The Entertainment Graph to create API programs, analytics dashboards, additional consumer apps, and other products that allow everyone to make the most of MediaHound’s unique data platform. With the help of everyone in the entertainment ecosystem, we will continue to grow and improve The Entertainment Graph.

Announcing the MediaHound API Program

August 1, 2015 by MediaHound on Company News, Data Mining 


The Entertainment Graph is a graph database made up of all the world’s music, books, games, film and television, connecting artists, fans, franchises and more in a powerful and unique way.
This connected data powers our apps at MediaHound, but we aren’t the only ones with a vision for how to improve entertainment discovery. For that reason we are opening up our API to developers and partners, first in private beta and soon more broadly.

MediaHound LogoHamburger IconLoginOur AppsCaret Down IconIcon HeartDateNight TextIcon NextQueue>NextQueue TextIcon SearchFindMedia TextStar IconText for Our AwardsThe Entertainment Graph IconThe Entertainment Graph TextDeveloper IconDevelopersContact IconContact UsView our FacebookView our TwitterTerms of ServiceVersion 1.1.1, published October 31, 2014.1. INTRODUCTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF TERMSWelcome to MediaHound®, an online entertainment discovery service that allows you to find, collect, share, and access entertainment distributors, from your web browser, on your compatible mobile devices, and natively on your compatible iOS device. MediaHound’s website is located at www.mediahound.com (the “MediaHound Site”). We refer to the MediaHound Site and the software applications made available by MediaHound as the “Service Applications”, and we refer to the Service Applications and the service provided through the Service Applications, collectively, as the “MediaHound Service”. These Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”) set forth a binding agreement between you and MediaHound governing your use of the MediaHound Service. These Terms of Service act as the end user license agreement (or “EULA”) governing your use of the desktop and mobile Service Applications.In these Terms of Service, “MediaHound” means MediaHound, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with its principal business address at 112 Arena Street, El Segundo, CA 90245. Please read these Terms of Service carefully. By using any of the MediaHound Service, or by creating a user account, you signify your acceptance of these Terms of Service, as they may be amended by MediaHound from time to time in its sole discretion. You may only use the MediaHound Service and/or open an account if applicable law does not prohibit your acceptance of these Terms of Service. YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD. If you are younger than 18 years old, you must get permission from a parent or guardian to open an account and your parent or guardian must agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, then you must cease using the MediaHound Service. THESE TERMS OF SERVICE ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS SET FORTH IN SECTION 21, DEPENDING ON THE TERRITORY IN WHICH YOU USE THE MEDIAHOUND SERVICE.2. POLICIES2.1 MediaHound’s Sharing PolicyWhen you discover, play, collect, comment-on, post, and share entertainment or other content on or through the MediaHound Service, you authorize MediaHound to share and/or publicly display such activity on or through: (i) the MediaHound Service; and (ii) any third party social networking sites and services you have linked to your MediaHound account, such as Facebook or Twitter (“Social Networks”).2.2 Abuse PolicyMediaHound reserves the right to manage the MediaHound Service in a manner that it believes best benefits its users and best enables it to maintain the MediaHound Service. The MediaHound Service is for your own personal, non-commercial use, and accordingly, MediaHound has determined that its ability to provide the MediaHound Service is disrupted when users make an abnormally high number of requests against the service in a short amount of time, or otherwise browse, search, or “scrape” in a manner that is not consistent with normal, personal use (even if those activities technically comply with the specific terms of any free or paid offering). Thus, MediaHound reserves the right to discontinue any portion or all of the MediaHound Service, or to terminate or suspend the account of any person, that, in MediaHound’s experience and sole determination, cause or result in disruptive usage patterns or, with respect to individual account holders, otherwise use the MediaHound Service in a manner that is not consistent with normal, personal use. For example, you should not share your MediaHound account with anyone, or have a software application use the MediaHound Service for you for any purpose (unless otherwise permitted by MediaHound).3. PROPRIETARY RIGHTSYou acknowledge and agree that MediaHound, and its licensors, retain all right, title and interest in and to all data and information (excluding data and information that you provide), content and materials provided on or through the MediaHound Service (including, without limitation, the musical compositions, audiovisual works, editorial and contextual information (about artists, cast, crew, movies, TV shows, books, video games, and songs), text, images, photographs, videos, graphics, page headers, the selection and arrangement of elements displayed on or through the MediaHound Service, the compilation of all content and materials on the MediaHound Service, and the business process, procedures, methods and techniques used in the MediaHound Service) and all associated patent rights, copyright rights, trademark rights, trade secret rights and other intellectual property and proprietary rights recognized anywhere in the world. MediaHound®, the MediaHound logo and the MediaHound “button” logo are the common law and/or registered trademarks of MediaHound, Inc., and all other proprietary trademarks, service marks, trade names, slogans, logos, and other sign of origin that appear on or in connection with the MediaHound Service (including, without limitation, as displayed on or through any of the Service Applications) are the property of MediaHound, Inc. MediaHound’s intellectual property, including, without limitation, its trademarks and trade dress, may not be used in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among users, or in any manner that disparages MediaHound. All rights are expressly reserved.All third party trademarks, logos, photographs, images, audio and audio-visual content, programming, and other intellectual property contained on or within the Service Applications and through the MediaHound Service are the property of the respective third parties, including the respective content owners, and may be protected by applicable copyright, trademark or other intellectual property laws and treaties. Each such third party expressly reserves all rights into such intellectual property. Use of third party software or services is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable third party license agreements, and you agree to look solely to the applicable third party and not to MediaHound to enforce any of your rights in relation thereto.4. Internet video archive (iva) DATACertain portions of the Content available on or through the MediaHound Service comprise third-party proprietary data provided by Internet Video Archive LLC (IVA). IVA Data is the property of Internet Video Archive LLC. You may not modify, copy, scan or use any other method to reproduce, duplicate, translate, republish, transmit or distribute in any way any portion of the IVA Data. You may not use the IVA Data except for your own personal, non-commercial use. See http://www.internetvideoarchive.com/.5. LIMITED LICENSEMediaHound grants you a limited, non-exclusive and non-assignable license to access and use the MediaHound Service for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and not for redistribution of any kind. MediaHound may make certain software, including, without limitation, the Service Applications, available to you through your use of the MediaHound Service. The Service Applications are deemed licensed to you by MediaHound under a non-exclusive, non-assignable license for your personal, non-commercial, use only, and your use of such Service Applications is subject to these Terms of Service. With respect to any mobile Service Application, this license is limited to the right to use the applicable mobile Service Application solely on a device that you own or control and as permitted by any usage rules made available from time to time by the applicable provider of a mobile application platform. MediaHound does not transfer, and, as between you and MediaHound, retains all title to and ownership of the Service Applications and all intellectual property rights in the Service Applications. You may not take any action to jeopardize, limit or interfere with MediaHound’s ownership of and rights with respect to the Service Applications. You acknowledge that any unauthorized copying or unauthorized use of the Service Applications is a violation of these Terms of Service and is strictly prohibited.Additionally, you may not (i) remove any trademarks, copyright notices or any other notice contained in any content, materials or individual elements provided on or through the MediaHound Service, (ii) reproduce, download (other than page caching), modify, publish, distribute, transmit, disseminate, broadcast, transfer, license, sell, rent, lease, adapt, create derivative works of, publicly display or perform, or in any way exploit any content, materials or individual elements provided on or through the MediaHound Service without MediaHound’s prior written consent, (iii) make any commercial use or any derivative use of any of the MediaHound Service or any of the content, materials or individual elements provided on or through the MediaHound Service, (iv) frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any content, materials or individual elements provided on or through the MediaHound Service without MediaHound’s prior written consent, (v) use any circumvention tools or any metatags or other hidden text utilizing MediaHound’s name, trademark, URL or the name of any of the MediaHound Service without MediaHound’s prior written consent, or (vi) disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Software or any other materials made available on or through the MediaHound Service or used to provide any of the MediaHound Service.6. ACCOUNTS AND SECURITYTo access the Service Applications or use certain aspects of the MediaHound Service, you will be directed to create a user account by providing certain information about yourself, or to create new, or to use existing Social Network login details. As part of MediaHound’s stand-alone registration process, you will be asked to submit, among other things, your email address and to select a password. You agree that all information you provide to MediaHound for purposes of creating an account (“Registration Information”) will be true, accurate, current and complete and your failure to provide such information will constitute a breach of these Terms of Service and may result in the immediate termination of your account. By utilizing your Social Network log-in details to log into the MediaHound Service (including on or through any of the Service Applications), or by linking your MediaHound Service account with any Social Network account, you expressly authorize MediaHound to receive, and for such Social Network to share, certain of your information that is available on your Social Network account, including, without limitation, your profile information, friends names, your photos, privacy settings and certain other information that will be disclosed to you (and authorized by you) during the log-in process; and you also authorize MediaHound to generate and publish on your Social Network news feed or timeline actions you take on the MediaHound Service, and to allow you to interact with your Social Network friends on the MediaHound Service. If linked, you agree to allow the Social Networks to receive information concerning the actions you take on the MediaHound Service. In the event you no longer want the MediaHound Service to publish your MediaHound activity on your Social Network news feed or timeline, or want to otherwise limit the ways in which the MediaHound Service interacts with your Social Network account, you can always disable aspects of this feature by changing your application settings in the Social Networks. The Social Networks are made available by their respective corporate entities.Without limiting the above, by submitting your information through the Service Applications, and/or by utilizing Social Network log-in details to log-in to the MediaHound Service, by linking your MediaHound Service account with any Social Network account, or by otherwise providing Registration Information to MediaHound, you grant MediaHound a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, transmit, and display the information obtained from these third parties and any Registration Information in connection with MediaHound’s operation of the Service Applications and/or performance of the MediaHound Service (subject to the other terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, including Section 2.1).

You understand and agree that you will be liable for all activities that occur under any account created for your use, even if you did not commit such activities.

Additionally, your use of any mobile Service Application may be subject to the terms of any applicable agreement published by a mobile application platform provider or your wireless carrier.

MediaHound’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision and no waiver will be effective unless it is made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of MediaHound. You and MediaHound expressly acknowledge and agree that the language governing these Terms of Service, and the Privacy Policy and any other terms and conditions governing the use of the Service Applications and the MediaHound Service incorporated herein or incorporating these Terms of Service (collectively, the “Terms”), will be English. For your convenience, MediaHound may provide you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms.

In the event any litigation is brought by you or MediaHound in connection with these Terms of Service, the prevailing party in such litigation will be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation. You acknowledge and agree that, although these Terms of Service are solely between you and MediaHound, MediaHound’s third party licensors, including, without limitation, its content providers (such as record labels, publishers, performance rights organizations and providers of data services) and its mobile application platform providers, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms of Service, and upon your acceptance of these Terms of Service, these third parties will have the right to enforce these Terms of Service as if they were original parties to this document.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION22.1 NegotiationsBefore initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you and MediaHound agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms of Service (“Claim”) (except those Claims expressly provided in Section 22.6 below) informally for at least sixty (60) days. Negotiations will begin upon receipt of written notice. MediaHound will send its notice to your physical address (if on file with MediaHound) and email you a copy to the email address you have provided. You will send your notice to MediaHound, Inc., 112 Arena Street, El Segundo, CA 90245, ATTN: CLAIM.22.2 Binding ArbitrationIf the parties fail to resolve a Claim through negotiations within the above sixty (60) day period, you and MediaHound agree that, except as provided in Section 22.6 below, all Claims will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules”) and under the terms set forth in these Terms of Service. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 22 and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 22 will control and prevail. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 22.6, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, (i) you and MediaHound may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision will be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law. BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND MEDIAHOUND ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.22.3 Arbitration FeesIf you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will only need to pay an arbitration initiation fee of $250 and we will pay all other costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules. Notwithstanding anything in the clause titled “Miscellaneous” above to the contrary, you will not be required to pay our attorneys’ fees or other costs if you do not prevail in the arbitration.22.4 LocationThe arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify MediaHound in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of MediaHound’s arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or Internet connection appearances.22.5 LimitationsYou and MediaHound agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between MediaHound and you individually. YOU AND MEDIAHOUND AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION WILL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.22.6 Exceptions to Negotiations and ArbitrationYou and MediaHound agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or MediaHound’s intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration. As some jurisdictions do not allow for some of the dispute resolution provisions set forth in these Terms of Service, some of these provisions may not apply to you.22.7 SeverabilityYou and MediaHound agree that if any portion this “Dispute Resolution” section is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 22.6 above), that portion will be severed and the remainder of this section will be given full force and effect. If Section 22.6 above is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor MediaHound will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 22.6 above found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim will be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Los Angeles, State of California, United States of America, and you and MediaHound agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.23.
