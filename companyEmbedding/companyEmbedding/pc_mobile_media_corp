	You should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information, financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this prospectus. In this prospectus, unless the context otherwise denotes, references to we, us, our and Company refer to PC Mobile Media Corp..








	General Information about the Company






	PC Mobile Media Corp. was formed in the state of Nevada on August 22, 2015.  We are a development stage company with a plan of operation that offers mobile billboard display advertising. Our planned initial market will primarily occur in the Las Vegas area. We plan to conduct our business operations out of an administrative office provided by our director.





	Our mobile displays deliver a visual presentation that leaves the audience with an indelible impression. The Companys mission is to get our clients' message to the right audience at the right time.  Targeting the right audience at the right time is becoming increasingly difficult for advertisers.  Society in general has become more mobile and sophisticated at handling multiple tasks.  PC Mobile Media takes the advertisers message to the target audience anytime, anywhere. Our planned 10 X 20 four-color banners will get the attention of your target market by traveling along strategically chosen routs or penetrating and setting up stationary at special events or at specific locations.  Whether the client is geographically specific such as local political campaigns or a national product that seeks maximum exposure, PC Mobile Media takes the message to the customer.  





	Current management is comprised of Paul Conforte, CEO and President.  Due to the development stage of the Company, Mr. Conforte distributes part of his time toward the everyday operations and forward movement of the corporation.  Mr. Confortes responsibilities include acting as the companys director of operations, as well as determining the overall planning and direction of our Company.  Mr. Conforte does not have experience serving as the CEO of a public company, reviewing financial statements or serving as the CFO of a public company or being responsible for the preparation of the various Exchange Act reports required to be filed by public companies.  We have budgeted the cost to prepare and file the various Exchange Act reports in our Use of Proceeds section.  The costs of the reports are included in the accounting and legal and professional line items in the Use of Proceeds.  Please see section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations sub-section Proposed Milestones to Implement Business Operations for a quarterly detailed description of the reporting requirements.   These activities will be done by independent third party contractors.





	The Company is offering of 4,000,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $0.01. As of audited date September 30, 2015 our stockholders equity is $5,025.  Upon placement of the entire offering there will be 12,000,000 shares outstanding and the implied aggregate price of our common stock will be $120,000.





	PC Mobile Media Corp. is a development stage company that does not have any business operations.  The Company has had no revenue to date and we have incurred net losses.  Our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and we have been issued a going concern opinion. PC Mobile Media Corp. operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development activities, which include the following:





	1.


	Development of the PC Mobile Media Corp. business plan;





	2.


	Completion of the Company detailed Internal Control and Procedures Manual.  This will serve as a foundation for developing all phases of our operations.









	1










	3.


	Work on our website.





	4.


	Defining initial short-term and long-term marketing efforts including planned internet marketing, pricing, potential clients.





	PC Mobile Media Corp. is attempting to become operational and we do not have any business operations. We estimate to start generating revenue approximately three months after the closing of the public offering.  Investors should note that generating revenue approximately three months after the closing of the offering may be an ambitious goal and the Company may not be in a position to generate revenue for a much longer period of time and we may need additional funding in order to sustain our business.  In order to generate revenues, PC Mobile Media Corp. must address the following areas:





	1.



	Successfully execute our marketing and promotions plan.

	   



	2.




	Secure client base.




	3.




	Develop and offer market desirable products.     




	4.




	Offer competitively priced services.




	5.




	Continuously review our corporate structure and marketing efforts in an effort to nurture sustained growth of the Company.     



	6.



	Adapt our corporate principles for expanding into complementing services and new markets.



	 


	The Company believes that the net offering proceeds after offering expenses of $32,600 is sufficient for the company to become operational and sustain operations through the next twelve (12) months. The money we hope to raise through this stock offering has been budgeted to market our services, pay for the lease on the mobile billboard truck, pay for maintenance of the truck and to become a fully reporting company. Unfortunately, there can be no assurance that the actual expenses incurred will not materially exceed our estimates or that cash flow from services will be adequate to maintain our business. The company has incurred a net loss of $2,975 as of audit date September 30, 2015 and a net loss of $5,718 as of Unaudited date as of December 31, 2015. As a result, our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in the independent auditors report to the financial statements included in the registration statement.   As of audit date September 30, 2015 the Company had $5,025 in cash on hand and as of January 31, 2016 the Company had $2,425 in cash on hand.  We believe the cash we have available and the commitment from our sole shareholder to provide additional advances is sufficient to meet the obligations of the Company until we can initiate the offering.  There is no written commitment from Mr. Conforte to provide funds to the Company to further its business plans.  Please see section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sub-section Plan of Operation for a detailed discussion on managements commitment to advance funds to the Company.  Our President Mr. Conforte, has agreed to provide funds to the Company to further its business plans and meet its obligations until the Company can complete this raise.  The funds Mr. Conforte has agreed to provide will not be repaid from the raised funds. The costs of being public are included in the accounting and legal and professional line items in the Use of Proceeds section.  Please see section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations sub-section Proposed Milestones to Implement Business Operations for a quarterly detailed description of the reporting requirements.





	We estimate $5,000 is sufficient to keep the Company in compliance with regulatory agencies and meet its obligations to prudently further the business of the Company for the 180 date period the raise may take.  While management estimates $5,000 for such costs; there is no maximum amount of funds that Mr. Conforte has agreed to provide.  Mr. Conforte, because he is the sole officer and director, and although he has orally agreed to fund such amounts, as the sole officer and director such agreement is not binding and therefore it is within his sole discretion to provide such funds.  





	PC Mobile Media Corp. currently has one officer and director. This individual allocates time and personal resources to PC Mobile Media Corp. on a part-time basis and devotes approximately 15 hours a week to the Company.  The Company is a small and growing company.    With the additional funds from this offering the rate of expansion will increase however not to the point of requiring our sole officer to devote full time and attention to the corporation until sometime in the future.   Once the public offering is closed, Mr. Conforte plans to spend the time necessary to oversee business development, marketing campaigns, continued website design, and direct the primary operations of the business.  Mr. Conforte plans to become a full-time employee of the Company once it starts to generate sufficient revenue.

	As of the date of this prospectus, PC Mobile Media Corp. has 8,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock issued and outstanding.

	Risk Factors






	An investment in these securities involves an exceptionally high degree of risk and is extremely speculative in nature. Following are what we believe are material risks involved if you decide to purchase shares in this offering.





	RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMPANY:





	PAUL CONFORTE, THE SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY, CURRENTLY DEVOTES APPROXIMATELY 15 HOURS PER WEEK TO COMPANY MATTERS.  





	Our business plan does not provide for the hiring of any additional employees and may never generate enough revenue to support the hiring of additional employees.  Therefore, the responsibility of developing and furthering the company's business, offering and selling of the shares through this prospectus, and fulfilling the reporting requirements of a public company all fall upon Paul Conforte.  Once the public offering is closed, Mr. Conforte plans to spend the necessary time to finalize business development, direct the marketing efforts, to secure clients, and oversee the primary operations of the business.  Mr. Conforte, our sole officer has no experience in our intended line of business.  While Mr. Conforte does not intend to quit his current sales job upon the closing of the offering, he does intend to limit the hours at his job so he can dedicate the necessary time to the operation of this business.  It is anticipated that as the business grows Mr. Conforte will eventually fully quit his current sales job.  





	MR. CONFORTE DOES NOT HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMPANY EXPERIENCE AND IS INVOLVED IN OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  





	The Companys needs could exceed the amount of time or level of experience Mr. Conforte may have.  This could result in his inability to properly manage company affairs, resulting in our remaining a start-up company with no revenues or profits.  Mr. Conforte does not have experience serving as the CEO of a public company, reviewing financial statements or serving as the CFO of a public company or being responsible for the preparation of the various Exchange Act reports required to be filed by public companies.  We have budgeted the cost to prepare and file the various Exchange Act reports in our Use of Proceeds section.  These activities will be done by independent third party contractors.





	OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY OCCUPIES ALL THE POSITIONS.





	A risk exists that the Company may not have adequate internal controls because one person occupies all of the corporate positions.  A risk also exists that there may not be funds available for net income because the sole director and officer will determine their salary and perquisites.   





















	6










	MR. CONFORTE IS INVOLVED IN OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.





	We have not formulated a plan to resolve any possible conflict of interest with his other business activities. Mr. Confortes other business activities are limited to being employed as a Real Estate Agent working for Xpand Realty.  His responsibilities include listing and selling of homes, coordinating appointments to show properties to prospective buyers, confer with title companies, lenders, and home inspectors to ensure that the terms and conditions of purchase agreements are met before closing.  In the event he is unable to fulfill any aspect of his duties to the company we may experience a shortfall or complete lack of revenue resulting in little or no profits and eventual closure of the business.  





	THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED NO REVENUES AND DOES NOT HAVE AN OPERATING HERTORY; AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OFFERED HEREIN IS HIGHLY RISKY AND COULD RESULT IN A COMPLETE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN OUR BUSINESS PLAN.





	The Company was incorporated on August 22, 2015; we have not yet commenced our full-scale business operations and we have not yet realized any revenues. We have minimal operating history upon which an evaluation of our future prospects can be made. Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods as we incurred significant expenses associated with the initial startup of our business. Further, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in realizing revenues or in achieving or sustaining positive cash flow at any time in the future.





	Any such failure could result in the possible closure of our business or force us to seek additional capital through loans or additional sales of our equity securities to continue business operations, which would dilute the value of any shares you purchase in this offering.





	WE ARE A SHELL COMPANY AND THEREFORE INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE HIGHLY ILLIQUID NATURE OF THEIR INVESTMENT.





	The Company is a Shell Company as defined by as defined in Rule 405. As such, no shares will be eligible to be sold or transferred under Rule 144 until in excess of one year from the filing of the equivalent of Form 10 information by the Company with the SEC.





	OUR SHARES WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES





	A purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock.  The shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act.  The shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future.  The classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate her/her investment.  Please see section titled Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters for additional information regarding penny stock rules and investor implications.








	OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER MAY CAUSE PC MOBILE MEDIA CORP. TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES AFTER THE OFFERING IN ORDER TO FUND THE BUSINESS AND THEREBY FURTHER DILUTE THE HOLDINGS OF ANY PURCHASERS SHARES IN THE OFFERING.








	Our principal shareholder may cause PC Mobile Media Corp. to issue additional shares after the offering in order to fund the business and thereby further dilute the holdings of any purchasers in this offering.





	RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS


	AUDITORS GOING CONCERN





	As shown in the financial statements accompanying this prospectus, PC Mobile Media Corp. has had no revenues to date and has incurred only losses since its inception.  The Company has had no operations and has been issued a going concern opinion from our Independent Auditors, based upon the Companys reliance upon the sale of our common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations.









	7










	WE DO NOT YET HAVE ANY SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS AND ARE TOTALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE PROCEEDS OF THIS OFFERING TO FULLY FUND OUR BUSINESS.  IF WE DO NOT SELL ALL THE SHARES IN THIS OFFERING AS IT IS AN ALL-OR-NONE OFFERING THEN WE WILL HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE FINANCING TO COMPLETE OUR BUSINESS PLANS OR ABANDON THEM.





	PC Mobile Media Corp. has limited capital resources. To date, the Company has funded its operations from limited funding and has not generated any cash from operations to be profitable.  Unless PC Mobile Media Corp. begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, PC Mobile Media Corp. may experience liquidity and solvency problems.  Such liquidity and solvency problems may force PC Mobile Media Corp. to cease operations if additional financing is not available. No known alternative resources of funds are available to PC Mobile Media Corp. in the event it does not successfully place all of the shares in this all-or-none offering.  However, PC Mobile Media Corp. believes that if it is successful to place the all-or none offering the net proceeds of the Offering should be sufficient to satisfy the launch and operating requirements for the next twelve months.





	WE CANNOT PREDICT WHEN OR IF WE WILL PRODUCE REVENUES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A TOTAL LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN OUR BUSINESS PLANS.





	We have not generated any revenue to date from operations. In order for us to continue with our plans and operating our business, we must raise our initial capital through this offering. The timing of the completion of the milestones needed to commence operations and generate revenues is contingent on the success of this offering. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to maintain our business. As a result, you could lose all of your investment if you decide to purchase shares in this offering and we are not successful in our proposed business plans.





	OUR CONTINUED OPERATIONS DEPEND ON THE MARKETS ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PLANNED SERVICES. IF THE OUT-OF-DOORS ADVERTISING MARKET DOES NOT FIND OUR SERVICES DESIRABLE AND WE CANNOT ATTRACT CLIENTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE ANY REVENUES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A FAILURE OF OUR BUSINESS AND A LOSS OF ANY INVESTMENT YOU MAKE IN OUR SHARES.





	The ability to offer services that the market accepts and is willing to purchase is critically important to our success. We cannot be certain that the services we offer will be accepted by the marketplace.  As a result, there may not be any demand, our revenue stream could be limited, and we may never realize any revenues. In addition, there are no assurances that the Company will generate revenues in the future even if we offer alternative services or alter our services and marketing efforts and pursue alternative or complementing revenue generating services.  





	THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF PAUL CONFORTE COULD SEVERELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF REVENUES AND YOUR INABILITY TO EVER SELL ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THER OFFERING.





	Our performance is substantially dependent upon the professional expertise of our President, Paul Conforte. If he were unable to perform his services, this loss of his capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and operating results if we are unable to replace him with another qualified individual.  The loss of her services could result in a loss of revenues, which could result in a reduction of the value of any shares you purchase in this offering.





	THE OUT-OF-DOORS ADVERTISING MARKETPLACE IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.  IF WE CANNOT DEVELOP AND PROMOTE SERVICES THAT THE MARKET AND INDIVIDUALS ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO GENERATE ANY REVENUES.





	PC Mobile Media Corp. has many potential competitors in the out-of-doors advertising marketplace.  We acknowledge that our competition is competent, experienced, and they have greater financial, and marketing resources than we do at the present. Our ability to compete may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and marketing of their services than are available to us.






	8










	Some of PC Mobile Medias competitors may also offer a wider range of services and have greater name recognition.  They have greater customer loyalty bases and these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities.  In addition, our competitors may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, and adopt more aggressive advertising campaigns than PC Mobile Media Corp. at the present.  








	Risks Associated with this Offering






	WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES. UNLESS WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN SELLING THE SHARES AND RECEIVING THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING, WE MAY HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE FINANCING TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLANS AND YOU WOULD RECEIVE A RETURN OF YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.





	This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell them through our officer and director, who will receive no commissions. He will offer the shares to friends, relatives, acquaintances and business associates; however, there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. In the event we do not sell all of the shares before the expiration date of the offering, all funds raised will be promptly returned to the investors, without interest or deduction.





	DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING.





	There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the effectiveness of this Registration Statement and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board (OTCBB). We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.  The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter (OTC) securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements per se, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. Market Makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 or 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between PC Mobile Media Corp. or anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment.





	INVESTORS IN THIS OFFERING WILL BEAR A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LOSS DUE TO IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION





	The sole shareholder of PC Mobile Media Corp. is Paul Conforte who also serves as its Director, President, Secretary, and Treasurer.  Mr. Conforte holds 8,000,000 restricted shares of PC Mobile Media Corp. common stock.  Upon the sale of the common stock offered hereby, the investors in this offering will experience an immediate and substantial dilution.  Therefore, the investors in this offering will bear a substantial portion of the risk of loss. Additional sales of PC Mobile Media Corp. common stock in the future could result in further dilution. Please refer to the section titled Dilution herein.


















	9










	PURCHASERS IN THIS OFFERING WILL HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER DECISION MAKING BECAUSE PAUL CONFORTE, PC MOBILE MEDIA CORP. OFFICER, DIRECTOR AND SHAREHOLDER CONTROLS ALL OF PC MOBILE MEDIA CORP. ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.





	Presently, Paul Conforte, PC Mobile Media Corp. President, Secretary, and Treasurer and Director beneficially owns 100% of the outstanding common stock. Because of such ownership, investors in this offering will have limited control over matters requiring approval by PC Mobile Media Corp. security holders, including the election of directors. Mr. Conforte would retain 66.67% ownership in PC Mobile Media Corp. common stock assuming the offering is attained.  Such concentrated control may also make it difficult for PC Mobile Media Corp. stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of PC Mobile Media Corp. common stock in the event PC Mobile Media Corp. enters into transactions, which require stockholder approval. In addition, certain provisions of Nevada law could have the effect of making it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of PC Mobile Media Corp. For example, Nevada law provides that not less than two-thirds vote of the stockholders is required to remove a director for cause, which could make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of the Board of Directors. Their concentration of ownership limits the power to exercise control by the minority shareholders.





	WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE.  WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL.





	Our business plan allows for the estimated $7,400 cost of this Registration Statement to be paid from proceeds raised. In addition, Mr. Conforte, our sole office and director, has agreed to advance the Company funds to meet any ongoing obligations. We anticipate the costs of these obligations could total approximately $5,000 and these advances will not be repaid from the raised funds.  While management estimates $5,000 for such costs; there is no maximum amount of funds that Mr. Conforte has agreed to provide.  Please refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sub-section Plan of Operation for a detailed discussion of managements commitment.





	We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the effectiveness of this Registration Statement and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.  To be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. Market Makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 or 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all.










	SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.






	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements about PC Mobile Media Corp. business, financial condition, and prospects that reflect PC Mobile Media Corp. managements assumptions and beliefs based on information currently available. PC Mobile Media Corp. can give no assurance that the expectations indicated by such forward-looking statements will be realized. If any of PC Mobile Media Corp. assumptions should prove incorrect, or if any of the risks and uncertainties underlying such expectations should materialize, the actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.





	The key factors that are not within PC Mobile Media Corp. control and that may have a direct bearing on operating results include, but are not limited to, acceptance of our products, effectiveness of our marketing, our ability to attract new customers, managements ability to raise capital in the future, and the retention of key employees.





	There may be other risks and circumstances that management may be unable to predict to sustain operations. When used in this prospectus, words such as, believes, expects, intends, plans, anticipates, estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify and qualify forward-looking statements, although there may be certain forward-looking statements not accompanied by such expressions.

	USE OF PROCEEDS






	The following Use of Proceeds is based on estimates made by management.  The Company planned the Use of Proceeds after deducting estimated offering expenses estimated to be $7,400.  Management prepared the milestones based on placement of the entire offering of $40,000.  The costs associated with operating as a public company are included in our budget and management is responsible for the preparation of the required documents to keep the costs to a minimum.  We anticipate to begin generating revenues late second quarter or early in the third quarter following closing of the offering.  Investors should note that generating revenue approximately six months after the closing of the offering may be an ambitious goal and the Company may not be in a position to generate revenue for a much longer period of time and we may need additional funding in order to sustain our business.

	Notes:





	1.


	None of the proceeds allocated are intended to pay the CEO or Directors of the Company.





	The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the proceeds of this offering based on planned use of funds for our operations and current objectives. Any line item amounts not expended completely shall be held in reserve as working capital and subject to reallocation to other line item expenditures as required for ongoing operations.





	We currently consider the foregoing project our priority and intend to use the proceeds from this offering for such projects.








	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE






	The offering price of the common stock has been arbitrarily determined and bears no relationship to any objective criterion of value. The price does not bear any relationship to PC Mobile Media Corp. assets, book value, historical earnings, or net worth. In determining the offering price, management considered such factors as the prospects, if any, for similar companies, anticipated results of operations, present financial resources and the likelihood of acceptance of this offering.












	11



















	DILUTION






	Dilution figures based on Audited Financial Statements dated September 30, 2015





	Dilution represents the difference between the offering price of the shares of common stock and the net book value per share of common stock immediately after completion of the offering. Net Book Value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities from total assets. In this offering, the level of dilution is increased as a result of the relatively low book value of PC Mobile Media Corp. issued and outstanding stock. This is due in part because of the common stock issued to the PC Mobile Media Corp. officer, director, and employee totaling 8,000,000 shares at par value $0.001 per share versus the current offering price of $0.01 per share. PC Mobile Media Corp. net book value as of September 30, 2015 was $5,025. Assuming all 4,000,000 shares offered are sold, and in effect PC Mobile Media Corp. receives fixed amount of estimated proceeds of this offering from shareholders, PC Mobile Media Corp. net book value will be approximately $0.0031 per share. Therefore, any investor will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $0.0069 per share while the PC Mobile Media Corp. present stockholder will receive an increase of $0.0025 per share in the net tangible book value of the shares that he holds. This will result in a 69% dilution for purchasers of stock in this offering.

	Dilution figures based on Unaudited Financial Statements dated December 31, 2015





	Dilution represents the difference between the offering price of the shares of common stock and the net book value per share of common stock immediately after completion of the offering. Net Book Value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities from total assets. In this offering, the level of dilution is increased as a result of the relatively low book value of PC Mobile Media Corp. issued and outstanding stock. This is due in part because of the common stock issued to the PC Mobile Media Corp. officer, director, and employee totaling 8,000,000 shares at par value $0.001 per share versus the current offering price of $0.01 per share. PC Mobile Media Corp. net book value as of December 31, 2015 was $(693). Assuming all 4,000,000 shares offered are sold, and in effect PC Mobile Media Corp. receives fixed amount of estimated proceeds of this offering from shareholders, PC Mobile Media Corp. net book value will be approximately $0.0027 per share. Therefore, any investor will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $0.0073 per share while the PC Mobile Media Corp. present stockholder will receive an increase of $0.0076 per share in the net tangible book value of the shares that he holds. This will result in a 73% dilution for purchasers of stock in this offering.

	Business Overview








	BUSINESS OVERVIEW







	PC Mobile Media Corp., (PC Mobile Media Corp. or the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 22, 2015.  The primary business of the company is offering mobile billboard display advertising.  Our mobile displays deliver a visual presentation that leaves the audience with an indelible impression.  





	The Companys mission is to get our clients' message to the right audience at the right time.  Targeting the right audience at the right time is becoming increasingly difficult for advertisers.  Society in general has become more mobile and sophisticated at handling multiple tasks.  Consequently, we are tuning out unnecessary or unwanted information including certain print media and radio advertisements.





	Alternative media is everywhere from product advertisements on the floors of grocery stores, to audio monitors on gas station pumps, and pop-up ads on automated teller machines.  PC Mobile Media takes the advertisers message to the target audience anytime, anywhere.  Our planned 10 X 20 four-color banners will get the attention of your target market by traveling along strategically chosen routs or penetrating and setting up stationary at special events or at specific locations.  Whether the client is geographically specific such as local political campaigns or a national product that seeks maximum exposure, PC Mobile Media takes the message to the customer.  







	PRODUCT OVERVIEW








	Mobile Billboard Truck



	The Company has allocated sufficient funds from the private placement to lease a 2001 Isuzu 4000 Series Medium Duty Turbo Diesel Truck custom built as a promotional/advertising exhibit and display vehicle.  The display sides of the truck measure a definite attention getting 10 X 20.  We will utilize the quick mounting system that is located outside the trim to install banners.  This system insures a clean, tight and wrinkle-free installation.  As if our vibrant color 10 X 20 signage is not impressive enough, once the sun sets our illuminated system makes for a truly aesthetically pleasing and eye-catching advertisement display.


	  


	Other features we offer include GPS Tracking and Audio.  The GPS tracking system is in place for multiple reasons, but most importantly, it provides documented proof that your advertising campaign is getting delivered as designed.  The system tracks the route taken and produces detailed time-stamped bread crumb reports.  The reports are detailed and available in map version and or line item version.  Line item reports detail and time-stamp every stop and turn.  Reports are delivered to the client at the end of the campaign, on a weekly basis or as requested.  This type of reporting provides an invaluable tool to track the progress of your campaign and make changes and variations to the routes if desired.





	The audio system is comprised of speakers that can broadcast your message or simply play music.  The audio works while our truck is moving or stationary.  This added feature is a way of getting people to turn their heads.  Whether the client wants to broadcast a message about their products and or services, or just play music to serve as an attention getter; the goal is get noticed and make an indelible impression on the targeted customer.   






	Signage/Banners



	The signage is printed on long-lasting vinyl banner material.  We have identified a full service, state-of-the-art printing plant that offers digital composition, scanning, color correction, and digital proofing.  We plan to offer through our website our clients the ability to upload their graphics.  We will review the content to ensure that it meets at least the minimum specifications and then we will forward it to the printer.  Once the advertisement is proofed and printed, we can install.  The turnaround time for this process is as quick as 48 hours.  The cost for two 10 X 20 size banners is approximately $1,500 and the cost is paid for directly by the client.  This is an approximate cost as there may be a variance depending upon if the client desires a higher resolution image.












	17










	PC Mobile Media offers a one-stop shop solution to all our clients needs.  We plan to provide a proven and cost effective out-of-home advertising solution to get your message to your targeted audience.  







	MARKETING







	The Company has formulated a multifaceted marketing plan.  The initial phase of operations relies on the efforts of our President to market our services and procure sales.  Methods to market our services include word-of-mouth, established relationships, an email campaign to targeted potential customers, and direct mailing.  The web site will serve as a marketing tool as well as an operations tool.  The site we are developing will feature our products and services with pictures, testimonials, and statistics supporting the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of mobile billboard advertising.  The site will serve as an operations tool where advertising departments can view all the technical aspects and graphic specifications required for production of banners.  The web site will also feature an option to upload banner graphics.  Typically, the files of high-resolution advertisement graphics are very large and this feature serves to expedite the entire process from delivery to proofing the final layout.   





	PC Mobile Media Corp. plans to generate revenue from the sale of advertisement banners placed on the sides of our mobile billboard trucks.  Payment for services is due on a monthly basis and is paid a month in advance of the campaign commencing.  The mobile billboard rate is $60 per hour with a minimum run of six hours per day.  Our stationary mobile billboard rate is $30 per hour and a minimum of 8 hours per day.  We plan to offer weekly and monthly rates.  





	We have performed due diligence on the market and we have identified several business and market segments that we plan to market our services.  We believe our medium is an excellent tool for promoting products and services including:





	·


	Grand Openings - stores, restaurants, new neighborhood developments, etc.


	·


	Festivals - Local communities have ethnic related festivals such as San Gennero, Ice Cream Socials, Cinco de Mayo, etc.


	·


	Seasonal shows - Nutcracker Ballets, lighting ceremonies, light shows, 4

	th

	of July Celebrations, Easter Egg Hunts, etc.


	·


	Sales - Car dealerships, appliance stores, mattress stores, etc.


	·


	Concerts - park setting or hit band based


	·


	Movies - cinema featured movies


	·


	Trade Shows - conventions and trade shows where vendors advertise their products and services to conventioneers and businesses


	·


	Brand awareness - national products and service that need regional and local exposure


	·


	Sporting Events - baseball teams, hockey teams, basketball teams, boxing events, marathons, etc.


	·


	Political Advertising - local counsel, mayor, congressional, senate, judges, propositions, other government elect positions, etc.






	Joint Venture Opportunities



	Joint venture opportunities exist within the advertising industry and we plan to pursue and nurture this option.  We consider that our advertising medium is unique in the fact that we can deliver an impression by taking the message where it is most likely going to be view by the intended target market.  Networking with other advertising agencies can provide a revenue stream that mutually benefits both parties.  Typically, an advertising agency provides service for the client that involves exposure of their products and or services through multiple mediums.  They budget the advertising dollars by allocating it to diverse advertising mediums to try to ensure exposure for the clients products or services.  For example, when a convention comes to town a client may only be interested in marketing their products and services for that particular timeframe because their targeted customer is in town.  We provide a medium to seek out the customer by locating the advertisement at the airport when they arrive, then positioning the advertisement at the convention hall, and finally moving the truck to outside their hotel.  This campaign may only last a few days but it is effective and its advertising the clients can see for themselves.    


















	18











	Web Site



	The Company plans to secure a web domain and develop a web site within the first 90 days after closing the private placement.  We have budgeted funds for a modest, but efficient web site.  As discussed under the Marketing section of the Business Plan, the site will feature our products and services with pictures, testimonials, and statistics supporting the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the mobile billboard advertising.  The site will serve as an operations tool where advertising departments can view all the technical aspects and graphic specifications required for production of banners.  The web site will also feature an option to upload banner graphics and proofing is available on-line.





	Marketing of the site will consist of linking our site to complementary sites and search engines.  We plan to place a banner on complementary and related topic sites.  Placing our site with search engines is another valuable tool that is relatively inexpensive and has the potential to generate revenue with little maintenance.     







	INDUSTRY ANALYSIS




	 



	Out-of-Home Advertising Media



	Arbitron is an internationally recognized media and marketing research firm that describes the outdoor media as a growing medium for the following reasons.    


	  


	·


	The reach of outdoor media is significant because it reaches consumers that do not have significant exposure to newspapers or local television.  


	·


	The out-of-home media has an impressive reach because it has the ability to make an impression on a core group of consumers repeatedly.


	·


	Consumers are more likely to recall the advertiser and purchase the advertisers products/services when exposed repeatedly to messages.  





	We are a society that is getting busier and busier.  The trend is that people watch less television and read fewer newspapers, leaving advertisers and agencies looking to the outdoor medium in an effort to reach targeted consumers.  Our out-of-home mobile medium is the solution by delivering an impression to your targeted audience repeatedly and at the right time.  






	Medium Effectiveness



	The advertising industry agrees that out-of-home advertising is one of the lowest cost per thousand advertising.  Cost per thousand, or as its most commonly referred to as CPM, has a far lower CPM that all other more tradition forms of advertising including print and radio.  This equates to greater viewers for less money.  In addition to its cost effectiveness, out-of-home advertising received a high retention score.  Many other advertising mediums are stationary and repetitive thus our sub-conscious tends to filter the impression, if one is registered at all, its not as indelible.  Our mobile medium is in different places at different times and its size alone commands attention.  Other notable reasons for its effectiveness include:





	·



	Repetition:

	Your advertisement is seen repeatedly by your customers.  Image recognition begins and customers remember your message. Image recognition equates to customers may not need your products or services today, but when they do, they will think of you!


	·



	Local:

	Depending on the product or service, in general most of your customers come from within a 3-10 mile radius. Targeting the immediate local market gets your message across to the customers most likely to become yours on a regular basis.  







	GROWTH STRATEGY OF THE COMPANY







	The growth strategy of the Company is to build a strong portfolio of notable clients that provides a diversified revenue stream.  Having clients in diverse business and markets should allow the Company to weather changes in consumer trends, fads and the economic climate.  We want to establish a solid foundation for the pillars of long-term growth.  The goal of the Company is to expand operations by acquiring additional mobile billboard trucks and adapting to market changes.  A prudent and methodical growth strategy will secure market share for long-term success.  









	19












	COMPETITOR ANALYSIS







	PC Mobile Media Corp. has many potential competitors in the out-of-home media industry.  We consider the competition is competent, experienced, and they have greater financial and technical, and marketing resources than we do at the present.  Our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development, sales, and marketing of their products and services than are available to us.  





	Some of the Company's competitors also offer a wider range of services and products and have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases than our Company.  These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and customer requirements than the Company.  They may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer terms that are more attractive to customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the Company.  Moreover, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their services and products.  The Company expects that new competitors or alliances among competitors have the potential to emerge and may acquire significant market share.






	12 Month Growth Strategy and Milestones



	The following growth strategy and milestones are based on the estimates made by management.  The Company planned the goals and milestones after deducting estimated offering expenses estimated to be $7,400.  The costs associated with operating as a public company are included in our budget and management is responsible for the preparation of the required documents to keep the costs to a minimum.





	The working capital requirements and the projected milestones are approximations and subject to adjustments.  The Company believes that the net offering proceeds after offering expenses of $32,600 is sufficient for the company to become operational and sustain operations through the next twelve (12) months.   If we begin to generate profits, we plan to increase our marketing activities accordingly.  We anticipate to begin generating revenues late second quarter or early in the third quarter following closing of the offering. Investors should note that generating revenue approximately six months after the closing of the offering may be an ambitious goal and the Company may not be in a position to generate revenue for a much longer period of time and we may need additional funding in order to sustain our business.





	Note: The Company planned the milestones and estimated expenditures based on quarters following the closing of the public offering.  







	12 MONTH GROWTH STRATEGY AND MILESTONES







	The Company planned the goals and milestones based on raising $32,600 through the offering.  We have prudently budgeted the $32,600 to sustain operations for a twelve-month period.  We anticipate to begin generating revenues late second quarter or early in the third quarter following closing of the offering.





	Note: The Company planned the milestones based on quarters following the closing of the offering.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	The Board of Directors and Stockholders

	PC Mobile Media Corp.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of PC Mobile Media Corp. as of September 30, 2015, and the related statement of operations, stockholders deficiency, and cash flows for the period from Inception (August 22, 2015) through September 30, 2015.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 


	 


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatemPCent.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PC Mobile Media Corp. as from Inception (August 22, 2015) through September 30, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has significant net losses and cash flow deficiencies.  Those conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.  Managements plans regarding those matters are described in Note 2.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	September 30, 2015











	NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION







	PC Mobile Media Corp. (PC Mobile Media Corp. or the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 22, 2015.  The primary business of the company is to offer mobile billboard display advertising.  Our mobile displays deliver a visual presentation that leaves the audience with an indelible impression.








	NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN







	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the period from inception on August 22, 2015 through September 30, 2015, the Company had no operations. As of September 30, 2015, the Company had not emerged from the development stage. In view of these matters, the Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Companys ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.






	The sole officer/director has agreed to advance funds to the Company to meet its obligations.







	NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES








	Basis of Presentation



	The financial statements present the balance sheets, statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.






	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.







	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalent.  At September 30, 2015, the Company had $5,025 in cash.







	Cash Flow Reporting



	The Company follows ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (Indirect method) as defined by ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period.






	F-6












	Financial Instruments



	The Companys balance sheet includes certain financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and related party payable. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.





	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:














	Level 1




	Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities






	Level 2




	Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.






	Level 3




	Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.









	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2015. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.







	Advertising



	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  As of September 30, 2015, no advertising costs have been incurred.






	Revenue and Cost Recognition



	The Company has no current source of revenue; therefore the Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost.







	Income Taxes



	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.  






	Net Loss per Share



	Basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Dilutive loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the Company.  Because the Company does not have any potentially dilutive securities, the accompanying presentation is only of basic loss per share.












	F-7











	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	In September 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, which eliminated certain financial reporting requirements of companies previously identified as Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). The amendments in this ASU simplify accounting guidance by removing all incremental financial reporting requirements for development stage entities. The amendments also reduce data maintenance and, for those entities subject to audit, audit costs by eliminating the requirement for development stage entities to present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity.   Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entitys financial statements have not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption, entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by Topic 915.  The Company has not adopted this standard at this time.  Future adoption is not considered, by management, to have any material impact to the financial statements.





	In August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15 Preparation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entitys liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entitys liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements-Liquidation Basis of Accounting. Even when an entitys liquidation is not imminent, there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events.  The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted.  The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU, however, at the current period, management does not believe that it has met conditions which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure.





	The company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the companys financial statement.







	NOTE 4 - CAPITAL STOCK







	The Company is authorized to issue an aggregate of 75,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share.  No preferred shares have been authorized or issued.  At September 30, 2015, 8,000,000 common shares are issued and outstanding.





	On September 22, 2015, the Company issued 5,750,000 Founders shares at $0.001 per share (par value) for total cash of $5,750.





	On September 22, 2015, the Company issued 2,250,000 shares for services provided since inception.  These shares were issued at par value ($0.001 per share) for services valued at $2,250.





	At September 30, 2015, there are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional shares of common stock of the Company.








	NOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES







	We did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes when it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit.  We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carry forwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.









	F-8










	The components of the Companys deferred tax asset and reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory rate to the income tax amount recorded as of 2015 is as follows:
















	 




	 





	September 30, 2015







	Net operating loss




	 




	$




	2,975






	Effective Tax rate




	 




	 




	34%






	Deferred Tax Assets




	 




	 




	1,011






	Less:  Valuation Allowance




	 




	 




	(1,011)






	Net deferred tax assets




	 




	$




	0









	The net federal operating loss carry forward will expire in 2035.  This carry forward may be limited upon the consummation of a business combination under IRC Section 381.







	NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS







	In support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it has relied on advances from its sole shareholder until such time that the Company can support its operations through merger or acquisition, or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. The sole shareholder has pledged his support to fund continuing operations; however, there is no written commitment to this effect.  The Company is dependent upon this continued support.  Amounts shown represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note; they are non-interest bearing and payable on demand.  At September 30, 2015, the shareholder has paid expenses on behalf of the Company in the amount of $725 which is represented in the shares issued for cash.





	The Company has limited need for office facilities and does not own or lease property or lease office space. The office space used by the Company was arranged by the sole shareholder of the Company to use at no charge.





	The Company does not have employment contracts with its key employees, including the sole shareholder who is the sole officer of the Company.





	The amounts and terms of the above transactions may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts and terms that would have been incurred had comparable transactions been entered into with independent third parties.








	NOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES







	The Companys operations are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including financial, operational and regulatory risks.  The Company may not find suitable merger or acquisition opportunities, therefore there is the potential risk of business failure.





	From time to time the Company may be a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company.  Management believes that there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.








	NOTE 8 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS







	Management has evaluated subsequent events through January 7, 2015, the date the financial statements were available to be issued. Management is not aware of any significant events that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date that would have a material effect on the financial statements thereby requiring adjustment or disclosure.

	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	December 31, 2015











	NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION







	PC Mobile Media Corp. (PC Mobile Media Corp. or the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 22, 2015.  The primary business of the company is to offer mobile billboard display advertising.  Our mobile displays deliver a visual presentation that leaves the audience with an indelible impression.





	Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys September 30, 2015 audited financial statements.  The results of operations for the period ended December 31, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year.







	NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN







	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the period from inception on August 22, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the Company had no operations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had not emerged from the development stage. In view of these matters, the Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Companys ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.







	NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES








	Basis of Presentation



	The financial statements present the balance sheets, statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity/deficit, and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.






	Advertising



	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, no advertising costs have been incurred.






	Property



	The Company does not own or rent any property.  The office space is provided by the CEO at no charge.






	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalent.  At December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, the Company had $2,425 and $5,025 in cash, respectively.












	F-13











	Revenue and Cost Recognition



	The Company has no current source of revenue; therefore, the Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost.






	Net Loss per Share



	Basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Dilutive loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the Company.  Because the Company does not have any potentially dilutive securities, the accompanying presentation is only of basic loss per share.






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	The company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the companys financial statement.







	NOTE 4 - CAPITAL STOCK







	The Company is authorized to issue an aggregate of 75,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share.  No preferred shares have been authorized or issued.  At both December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, 8,000,000 common shares are issued and outstanding.





	On September 22, 2015, the Company issued 5,750,000 Founders shares at $0.001 per share (par value) for total cash of $5,750.





	On September 22, 2015, the Company issued 2,250,000 shares for services provided since inception.  These shares were issued at $0.001 per share (par value) for services valued at $2,250.





	At December 31, 2015, there are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional shares of common stock of the Company.







	NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS







	At December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, the President has loaned the Company $2,518 and $0, respectively.  The loans are payable on demand and carry no interest.







	NOTE 6 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS







	Management has evaluated subsequent events through March 7, 2016, the date the financial statements were available to be issued. Management is not aware of any significant events that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date that would have a material effect on the financial statements thereby requiring adjustment or disclosure.




















































	F-14
















	Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters






	No public market currently exists for shares of our common stock.  Following completion of this offering, we intend to apply to have our common stock listed for quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.





	PENNY STOCK RULES





	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks.  Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system).





	A purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock.  The shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act.  The shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future.  The classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate her/her investment.  Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares will be subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Securities and Exchange Act.  Rather than creating a need to comply with those rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock.





	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document, which:





	·


	Contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stock in both Public offerings and secondary trading;





	·


	Contains a description of the broker

	

	s or dealer

	

	s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended;





	·


	Contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including

	

	bid

	

	and

	

	ask

	

	price for the penny stock and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;





	·


	Contains a toll-free number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;





	·


	Defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and,





	·


	Contains such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format) as the Securities and Exchange Commission shall require by rule or regulation.





	·


	The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, to the customer:





	·


	The bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;





	·


	The compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;





	·


	The number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and





	·


	Monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account.












	24







	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgement of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.  These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules.  Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling their securities.





	REGULATION M

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS








	Plan of Operation






	The Company plans to proceed with planned operations upon closing of the offering.  Upon receipt of the proceeds from the raise the Company plans to commence operations and execute its business plan as discussed in the Use of Proceeds section.  Release of the funds to the Company is based upon our escrow agent, Law Offices of Joseph L. Pittera, Eqs. reviewing the records of the depository institution holding the escrow to verify that that the checks have cleared prior to releasing the funds to the Company.  Until the Company receives funds from the raise, Mr. Conforte, our sole office and director, has agreed to advance the Company funds to meet its obligations.  We anticipate the costs of these obligations could total approximately $5,000 and these advances will not be repaid from the raised funds.  While management estimates $5,000 for such costs; there is no maximum amount of funds that Mr. Conforte has agreed to provide.  Mr. Conforte has access to funds to meet the obligations in the discussion.  Mr. Conforte, because he is the sole officer and director, and although he has orally agreed to fund such amounts, as the sole officer and director such agreement is not binding and therefore it is within his sole discretion to provide such funds.  Mr. Conforte has agreed to advance the funds to the Company and does not expect repayment of the funds as they will be booked as capital contribution.

	UNDERTAKINGS






	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:


	 


	(1)  To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:


	 


	i. To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;


	 


	ii. To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement.


	 


	iii. To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;


	 






	35










	(2)  That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.


	 


	(3)  To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.


	 


	(4)  That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:


	 


	Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date is it first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.


	 


	(5)  That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities:


	 


	The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registration will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	 


	(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (§230.424 of this chapter);


	 


	(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;


	 


	(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and


	 


	(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	(6)  Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of the registrants counsel  the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

The following Use of Proceeds is based on estimates made by management.  The
Company planned the Use of Proceeds after deducting estimated offering expenses
estimated to be $7,400.  Management prepared the milestones based on placement
of the entire offering of $40,000.  The costs associated with operating as a
public company are included in our budget and management is responsible for the
preparation of the required documents to keep the costs to a minimum.  We
anticipate to begin generating revenues late second quarter or early in the
third quarter following closing of the offering.  Investors should note that
generating revenue approximately six months after the closing of the offering
may be an ambitious goal and the Company may not be in a position to generate
revenue for a much longer period of time and we may need additional funding in
order to sustain our business.

PC Mobile Media Corp. intends to use the proceeds from this offering as follows:

                   Offering Expenses                           
                   Legal & Professional Fees       2,000   5.00
                   Accounting Fees                 3,500   8.75
                   Edgar Fees                        900   2.25
                   Blue-sky fees                   1,000   2.50
                   Total Offering Expenses         7,400  18.50
                                                               
                   Net Proceeds from Offering     32,600  81.50
                                                               
                   Use of Net Proceeds                         
                   Accounting Fees                 8,000  20.00

                   Edgar Fees                      1,700   4.25

                   Total Use of Net Proceeds      32,600  81.50
                                                               
                   Total Use of Proceeds          40,000 100.00

Notes:

1. None of the proceeds allocated are intended to pay the CEO or Directors of 
   the Company.

The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the proceeds of
this offering based on planned use of funds for our operations and current
objectives. Any line item amounts not expended completely shall be held in
reserve as working capital and subject to reallocation to other line item
expenditures as required for ongoing operations.

We currently consider the foregoing project our priority and intend to use the
proceeds from this offering for such projects.


PC Mobile Media Corp. has many potential competitors in the out-of-home media
industry.  We consider the competition is competent, experienced, and they have
greater financial and technical, and marketing resources than we do at the
present.  Our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected by the
ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development,
sales, and marketing of their products and services than are available to us.  

Some of the Company's competitors also offer a wider range of services and
products and have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases
than our Company.  These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new
or changing opportunities, technologies and customer requirements than the
Company.  They may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities,
offer terms that are more attractive to customers and adopt more aggressive
pricing policies than the Company.  Moreover, current and potential competitors
have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or
with third parties to enhance their services and products.  The Company expects
that new competitors or alliances among competitors have the potential to emerge
and may acquire significant market share.


Company Description
PC Mobile Media Corp. was formed in the state of Nevada on August 22, 2015.  We
are a development stage company with a plan of operation that offers mobile
billboard display advertising. Our planned initial market will primarily occur
in the Las Vegas area. We plan to conduct our business


 operations out of an
administrative office provided by our director.

Our mobile displays deliver a visual presentation that leaves the audience with
an indelible impression. The Company’s mission is to get our clients' message to
the right audience at the right time.  Targeting the right audience at the right
time is becoming increasingly difficult for advertisers.  Society in general has
become more mobile and sophisticated at handling multiple tasks.  PC Mobile
Media takes the advertisers message to the target audience anytime, anywhere.
Our planned 10’ X 20’ four-color banners will get the attention of your target
market by traveling along strategically chosen routs or penetrating and setting
up stationary at special events or at specific locations.  Whether the client is
geographically specific such as local political campaigns or a national product
that seeks maximum exposure, PC Mobile Media takes the message to the customer.

PC Mobile Media Corp. has administrative offices located at 9345 Falls Peak

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing in this Form 10-K and are hereby referenced. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. We believe it is important to communicate our expectations. However, our management disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  These forward-looking statements are based on our management's current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. You should not rely upon these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events because we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. You can identify a forward-looking statement by the use of the forward-terminology, including words such as "may", "will", "believes", "anticipates", "estimates", "expects", "continues", "should", "seeks", "intends", "plans", and/or words of similar import, or the negative of these words and phrases or other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: our sales, results of operations and anticipated cash flows; capital expenditures; depreciation and amortization expenses; sales, general and administrative expenses; our ability to maintain and develop relationship with our existing and potential future customers; and, our ability to maintain a level of investment that is required to remain competitive. Many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: variability of our revenues and financial performance; risks associated with technological changes; the acceptance of our products in the marketplace by existing and potential customers; disruption of operations or increases in expenses due to our involvement with litigation or caused by civil or political unrest or other catastrophic events; general economic conditions, government mandates; and, the continued employment of our key personnel and other risks associated with competition.  Overview  PC Mobile Media Corp., ("PC Mobile Media Corp." or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 22, 2015. The primary business of the company is offering mobile billboard display advertising. Our mobile displays deliver a visual presentation that leaves the audience with an indelible impression.  The Company's mission is to get our clients' message to the right audience at the right time. Targeting the right audience at the right time is becoming increasingly difficult for advertisers. Society in general has become more mobile and sophisticated at handling multiple tasks. Consequently, we are tuning out unnecessary or unwanted information including certain print media and radio advertisements. Alternative media is everywhere from product advertisements on the floors of grocery stores, to audio monitors on gas station pumps, and pop-up ads on automated teller machines. PC Mobile Media takes the advertisers message to the target audience anytime, anywhere. Our planned 10' X 20' four-color banners will get the attention of your target market by traveling along strategically chosen routs or penetrating and setting up stationary at special events or at specific locations. Whether the client is geographically specific such as local political campaigns or a national product that seeks maximum exposure, PC Mobile Media takes the message to the customer.  Plan of Operation  PRODUCT OVERVIEW  Mobile Billboard Truck  The Company has allocated sufficient funds from the private placement to lease a 2001 Isuzu 4000 Series Medium Duty Turbo Diesel Truck custom built as a promotional/advertising exhibit and display vehicle. The display sides of the truck measure a definite attention getting 10' X 20'. We will utilize the quick mounting system that is located outside the trim to install banners. This system insures a clean, tight and wrinkle-free installation. As if our vibrant color 10' X 20' signage is not impressive enough, once the sun sets our illuminated system makes for a truly aesthetically pleasing and eye-catching advertisement display.  Other features we offer include GPS Tracking and Audio. The GPS tracking system is in place for multiple reasons, but most importantly, it provides documented proof that your advertising campaign is getting delivered as designed. The system tracks the route taken and produces detailed time-stamped "bread crumb" reports. The reports are detailed and available in map version and or line item version. Line item reports detail and time-stamp every stop and turn. Reports are delivered to the client at the end of the campaign, on a weekly basis or as requested. This type of reporting provides an invaluable tool to track the progress of your campaign and make changes and variations to the routes if desired.  The audio system is comprised of speakers that can broadcast your message or simply play music. The audio works while our truck is moving or stationary.  Signage/Banners  The signage is printed on long-lasting vinyl banner material. We have identified a full service, state-of-the-art printing plant that offers digital composition, scanning, color correction, and digital proofing. We plan to offer through our website our clients the ability to upload their graphics. We will review the content to ensure that it meets at least the minimum specifications and then we will forward it to the printer. Once the advertisement is proofed and printed, we can install. The turnaround time for this process is as quick as 48 hours. The cost for two 10' X 20' size banners is approximately $1,500 and the cost is paid for directly by the client. This is an approximate cost as there may be a variance depending upon if the client desires a higher resolution image.  PC Mobile Media offers a one-stop shop solution to all our clients' needs. We plan to provide a proven and cost effective out-of-home advertising solution to get your message to your targeted audience.  MARKETING  The Company has formulated a multifaceted marketing plan. The initial phase of operations relies on the efforts of our President to market our services and procure sales. Methods to market our services include word-of-mouth, established relationships, an email campaign to targeted potential customers, and direct mailing. The web site will serve as a marketing tool as well as an operations tool. The site we are developing will feature our products and services with pictures, testimonials, and statistics supporting the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of mobile billboard advertising. The site will serve as an operations tool where advertising departments can view all the technical aspects and graphic specifications required for production of banners.  PC Mobile Media Corp. plans to generate revenue from the sale of advertisement banners placed on the sides of our mobile billboard trucks. Payment for services is due on a monthly basis and is paid a month in advance of the campaign commencing. The mobile billboard rate is $60 per hour with a minimum run of six hours per day. Our stationary mobile billboard rate is $30 per hour and a minimum of 8 hours per day. We plan to offer weekly and monthly rates.  We have performed due diligence on the market and we have identified several business and market segments that we plan to market our services. We believe our medium is an excellent tool for promoting products and services including:  �  Grand Openings - stores, restaurants, new neighborhood developments, etc.  �  Festivals - Local communities have ethnic related festivals such as San Gennaro, Ice Cream Socials, Cinco de Mayo, etc.  �  Seasonal shows - Nutcracker Ballets, lighting ceremonies, light shows, 4th of July Celebrations, Easter Egg Hunts, etc.  �  Sales - Car dealerships, appliance stores, mattress stores, etc.  �  Concerts - park setting or hit band based  �  Movies - cinema featured movies  �  Trade Shows - conventions and trade shows where vendors advertise their products and services to conventioneers and businesses  �  Brand awareness - national products and service that need regional and local exposure  �  Sporting Events - baseball teams, hockey teams, basketball teams, boxing events, marathons, etc.  �  Political Advertising - local counsel, mayor, congressional, senate, judges, propositions, other government elect positions, etc.  Results of Operations for the Year Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Period August 22, 2015 (Inception) through September 30, 2015  Revenues. The Company did not have any revenue for the year ended September 30, 2016. The Company's revenues for the year ended September 30, 2016 were $0 as compared to $0 for the period August 22, 2015 through September 30, 2015.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2016 were $37,720 as compared to $725 for the period August 22, 2015 (Inception) through September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses increased due to the Company initiating its business plan and incurred expenses relating to being a public reporting company, including professional service fees for preparing our SEC reports, and transfer agent fees.  Professional Fees. Professional fees for the year ended September 30, 2016 were $22,700 as compared to $2,250 for the period August 22, 2015 (Inception) through September 30, 2015. Professional Fees increased due to the Company initiating its business plan and incurred expenses relating to being a public reporting company, including professional service fees for preparing our SEC reports.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following:   As of As of September 30, 2016 September 30, 2015 Cash $ 4,050 $ 5,025 Prepaid Expenses - - Due from related party - - Working Capital (Deficit) (15,395) 5,025 Debt (current) $ 19,445 $ -  Impact of Inflation  We believe that the rate of inflation has had negligible effect on our operations. We believe we can absorb most, if not all, increased non-controlled operating costs by increasing sales prices, whenever deemed necessary and by operating our Company in the most efficient manner possible.  Net Cash Used in Operating Activities  We experienced no cash flow from operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2016 in the amount of $0 due to cash used to fund a net loss of $60,420, adjusted for non-cash expenses related to amortization of intangible assets, depreciation on equipment, impairment of long lived asset, accrued interest, as well as the increase in accounts payable for legal and accounting services to being a public reporting company. We experienced no cash flow from operating activities for the year ended August 22, 2015 through September 30, 2015 in the amount of $0 due to cash used to fund a net loss of $2,975, adjusted for non-cash expenses related to amortization of intangible assets, depreciation on equipment, accrued interest, as well as the increase in accounts payable for legal and accounting services to being a public reporting company.  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  We experienced no cash flow from investing activities for year ended September 30, 2016. We experienced no cash flow from investing activities for the year ended August 22, 2015 (Inception) through September 30, 2015.  Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities  For year ended September 30, 2016, we issued 4,000,000 shares of common stock for a total of $40,000 cash. For the period from August 22, 2015 (Inception) through September 30, 2015, we issued 5,750,000 shares for a total of $5,750 cash.  Availability of Additional Funds  Based on our working capital as of September 30, 2016, we will need additional equity and/or debt financing to continue our operations during the next 12 months. See "Description of Business".  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our significant estimates and assumptions include amortization, the fair value of our stock, and the valuation allowance relating to the Company's deferred tax assets.  We qualify as an "emerging growth company", as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, which became law in April, 2012. Under the JOBS Act, "emerging growth companies", can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  Reference is made to the "Organization and Significant Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 3 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for information related to new accounting pronouncements.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of September 30, 2016, we had no off balance sheet arrangements.  Material Commitments  There were no material commitments for the year ended September 30, 2016.  Purchase of Furniture and Equipment  There were no purchases of computers and equipment for the year ended September 30, 2016.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  We consider all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We have no cash equivalents.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.  Share Based Payments  We recognize compensation cost for stock-based awards to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718, over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche, as if multiple awards were granted. Compensation cost is based on grant-date fair value using quoted market prices for our common stock. We recognize compensation cost for stock-based awards to nonemployees in accordance with ASC Topic 505.  Earnings (Loss) Per Share  The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share". Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. There were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes as outlined in ASC 740, "Income Taxes". Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements" (ASC 820) and ASC 825, "Financial Instruments" (ASC 825), requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. It prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1 - Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 - Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.  Level 3 - Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  The carrying values of cash, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value. Pursuant to ASC 820 and 825, the fair value of cash is determined based on "Level 1" inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Reference is made to the "Organization and Significant Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 3 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for information related to new accounting pronouncements.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our
financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing in this report and
are hereby referenced.  The following discussion contains forward-looking
statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results
could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not
limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. You should not
place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as
of the date of this report.  We believe it is important to communicate our
expectations. However, our management disclaims any obligation to update any
forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events
or otherwise.
These forward-looking statements are based on our management's current
expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.  You should not
rely upon these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events
because we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these
statements will be achieved or will occur.  You can identify a forward-looking
statement by the use of the forward-terminology, including words such as "may",
"will", "believes", "anticipates", "estimates", "expects", "continues",
"should", "seeks", "intends", "plans", and/or words of similar import, or the
negative of these words and phrases or other variations of these words and
phrases or comparable terminology.  These forward-looking statements relate to,
among other things: our sales, results of operations and anticipated cash flows;
capital expenditures; depreciation and amortization expenses; sales, general and
administrative expenses; our ability to maintain and develop relationship with
our existing and potential future customers; and, our ability to maintain a
level of investment that is required to remain competitive.  Many factors could
cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in these
forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: variability of our
revenues and financial performance; risks associated with technological changes;
the acceptance of our products in the marketplace by existing and potential
customers; disruption of operations or increases in expenses due to our
involvement with litigation or caused by civil or political unrest or other
catastrophic events; general economic conditions, government mandates; and, the
continued employment of our key personnel and other risks associated with
competition.
PC Mobile Media Corp. was formed in the state of Nevada on August 22, 2015.  We
are a development stage company with a plan of operation that offers mobile
billboard display advertising.  Our planned initial market will primarily occur
in the Las Vegas area.  We plan to conduct our business operations out of an
administrative office provided by our director.
Plan of Operation
The Company's mission is to get our clients' message to the right audience at
the right time.  Targeting the right audience at the right time is becoming
increasingly difficult for advertisers.  Society in general has become more
mobile and sophisticated at handling multiple tasks.  Consequently, we are
tuning out unnecessary or unwanted information including certain print media and
radio advertisements.  Alternative media is everywhere from product
advertisements on the floors of grocery stores, to audio monitors on gas station
pumps, and pop-up ads on automated teller machines.  PC Mobile Media takes the
advertisers message to the target audience anytime, anywhere.  Our planned 10' X
20' four-color banners will get the attention of your target market by traveling

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to
the Three Months Ended December 31, 2015
Revenues.  The Company's revenues were $4,000 for the three ended December 31,
2016 as compared to $0 for the three months ended December 31, 2015.  On October
1, 2016, the Company entered into a Mobile Billboard Rental Agreement for 12
months of mobile billboard advertising at $2,000 per month.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.  Selling, general and
administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 were $1,600
as compared to $618 for the three months ended December 31, 2015. General and
administrative expenses increased because the Company incurred expenses related
to the increase in audit and transfer agent fees.
Professional Fees.  Professional Fees for the three months ended December 31,
2016 were $3,850 as compared to $5,100 for the three months ended December 31,
2015. General and administrative expenses decreased because the Company did not
incur the additional legal fees related to the initial S-1 filing.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following:


                                           As of                 As of
                                     December 31, 2016    September 30, 2016

        Cash and Cash Equivalents    $            1,575    $            4,050
        Working Capital (Deficit)              (16,845)              (15,395)
        Liabilities                              20,420                19,445



The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to
cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.  The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the
Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes
profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be
forced to cease operations.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other
things, additional capital resources.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that the rate of inflation has had negligible effect on our
operations. We believe we can absorb most, if not all, increased non-controlled
operating costs by increasing sales prices, whenever deemed necessary and by
operating our Company in the most efficient manner possible.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
We experienced negative cash flow from operating activities for the three months
ended December 31, 2016 in the amount of $2,475.  We experienced negative cash
flow from operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2015 in
the amount of $5,118.




                                       12


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
The cash used in investing activities during the three months ended December 31,
2016 and December 31, 2015 was $0 and $0, respectively.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended December 31,
2016 and December 31, 2015 was $0 and $2,518, respectively.
Availability of Additional Funds
The Company has financed its expenses and costs thus far through an equity
investment by one of its shareholders.  PC Mobile Media Corp. received a Notice
of Effectiveness on its filing Form S-1 from the Securities and Exchange
Commission on March 25, 2016 to offer on a best-efforts basis 4,000,000 shares
of its common stock at a fixed price of $0.01 per share.
PC Mobile Media Corp. closed its offering on June 10, 2016 and raised $40,000 by
placing 4,000,000 through its offering.
Management has been successful in raising $40,000 in funds from its offering and
which is budgeted to sustain operations for a twelve-month period.  If we begin
to generate profits, we will increase our marketing and sales activity
accordingly.  The Company currently has $1,575 in cash to meet its current
obligations, requiring additional capital for operating cash flow.  As of our
quarter ending December 31, 2016, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt
for continuation as a going concern.
At December 31, 2016, the Company is in contract with 2 Drink LLC to provide
mobile billboard advertising services at $2,000 per month.  The Company as a
whole may continue to operate at a loss for an indeterminate period thereafter,
depending upon the performance of its business. In the process of carrying out
its business plan, the Company will continue to identify new financial partners
and investors. However, it may determine that it cannot raise sufficient capital
in the future to support its business on acceptable terms, or at all.
 Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any additional funds will be
available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The company is
authorized to issue 75,000,000 shares of common stock.
We have no known demands or commitments and are not aware of any events or
uncertainties as of December 31, 2016 that will result in or that are reasonably
likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance
with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") applied on
a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
 Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our significant estimates and
assumptions include amortization, the fair value of our stock, and the valuation
allowance relating to the Company's deferred tax assets.




                                       13


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We qualify as an "emerging growth company", as defined in the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act, which became law in April, 2012.  Under the JOBS Act,
"emerging growth companies", can delay adopting new or revised accounting
standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have
elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting
standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting
standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Material Commitments
There were no material commitments during the three months ended December 31,
2016.
Purchase of Furniture and Equipment
We purchased no equipment during the three months ended December 31, 2016.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued that we adopt as of
the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of recently issued
standards that are not yet effective may have an impact on our results of
operations and financial position.
ASU Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) issued May
28, 2014 by FASB and IASB converged guidance on recognizing revenue in contracts
with customers on an effective date after December 31, 2017 will be evaluated as
to impact and implemented accordingly.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties
About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments require
management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to
continue as a going concern and provides guidance on determining when and how to
disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The standard
applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting
periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The
Company has evaluated the impact that this new guidance will have and has
included the appropriate disclosures in Note 2 to these financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to improve financial
reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that
lease assets ("lessees") to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset
on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than twelve months. A
lease liability is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a
lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the
lessee's right to use, or control use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
The amendments in this ASU simplify the accounting for sale and leaseback
transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease
liabilities. This ASU leaves the accounting for the organizations that own the
assets leased to the lessee ("lessor") largely unchanged except for targeted
improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers.
The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Lessees
(for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct
financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition
approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the
earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified
retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases
that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and
lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is
evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on its Financial Statements.



                                       14


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2016, we had no off balance sheet arrangements.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Disclosure under this section is not required for a smaller reporting company.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer (being the same person), to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in
reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to
apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's
principal executive and financial officer and effected by the Company's board of
directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
·
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
·
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the Company; and



·


Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




                                       15


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.  In making this
assessment, the Company's management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework.  The COSO framework is based upon five
integrated components of control: control environment, risk assessment, control
activities, information and communications and ongoing monitoring.
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal
financial officer has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act
were not effective as of December 31, 2016 (the "Evaluation Date"), to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  Each of the following is deemed a material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting:
·
We do not have an audit committee.  While we are not currently obligated to have
an audit committee, including a member who is an "audit committee financial
expert," as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K, under applicable regulations
or listing standards; however, it is management's view that such a committee is
an important internal control over financial reporting, the lack of which may
result in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of internal
controls and procedures.



·


We did not maintain proper segregation of duties for the preparation of our
financial statements.  We currently have only one officer overseeing all
transactions.  This has resulted in several deficiencies, including the lack of
control over preparation of financial statements and proper application of
accounting policies.
Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in the two items
above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management
believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee results in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and
procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial
statements in future periods.
Management's Remediation Initiatives
In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other
deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to initiate the
following series of measures once we have the financial resources to do so:
·
We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives
and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise
within the accounting function when funds are available to us. And, we plan to
appoint one or more outside directors to an audit committee resulting in a fully
functioning audit committee, which will undertake the oversight in the
establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, such
as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when
funds are available to us.



·


Management believes that the appointment of outside directors to a fully
functioning audit committee, would remedy the lack of a functioning audit
committee.




                                       16


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that
occurred during the period covered by this report, which were identified in
connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
This Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's
registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting.  Management's report was not subject to attestation by the
Company's independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this
Quarterly Report.
