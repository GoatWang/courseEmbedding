Old Mutual Unit Trusts Tax-Free Investment
Yes, tax-free! Investing in our unit trust based Tax-Free Investment (TFI) allows you to invest R33 000 tax-free each year, to a maximum of R500 000 in your lifetime, while enjoying all the benefits of a standard unit trust investment portfolio.  100% tax-free investing:  This means you pay no income tax, dividend tax and capital gains tax on the allowed tax-free amount.   What is this for?: The Government wants South Africans to save more and believes that offering tax-free savings and investment products will encourage more people to do this.  Easy to invest: You can invest directly online and via our secure site, by contacting our Client Service Centre on 0860 234 234 or by completing our application form English | Afrikaans.   How to invest: You can invest via debit order or a lump sum. Switches: You may also switch between unit trusts within your TFI account. Flexible payments: you can make lump-sum or monthly investments, and you can stop or restart your payments whenever you like, without incurring any penalties.
     No time limits: You can leave you money invested for as long as you like. No tie in: You can sell your units at any time BUT this will affect the amount of tax-free savings you enjoy for the tax year in which the withdrawal is made. Manage and transact: You’ll be able to access your TFI via our comprehensive secure site where you can manage your account and transact online. Tax and administration: We will provide any documents needed for your annual tax return. Transfers: You can transfer your TFI between financial services providers without penalty - but your overall investment amount in a tax-free savings product needs to stay within the R33 000 annual limit.   Important:  Going over the limit: Investments that go over R33 000 per year will be taxed at 40% on the extra amount. Use it this year: Unused tax-free investment amounts may not be "rolled over" to the following year. Withdrawals: If you invest R33 000 in a year and withdraw R15 000, you have still invested your full amount for the year. If you reinvest R15 000 into your account, you will go over the limit and will incur tax on the extra R15 000.  Distributions: Reinvested distributions do not impact your yearly investment limits – this is because investors are encouraged to reinvest dividends.  Adviser fees: Payment of upfront or ongoing adviser fees are not included and therefore does not impact your yearly investment limit.

The SA Funds are sub-advised by Dimensional Fund Advisors, one of the most respected money managers in America.
Each SA Fund has its own distinct risk and reward characteristics, investment objective, policies and strategies. The SA Funds are not intended for use as “stand-alone” funds, but are meant to be utilized as building blocks for fee-based investment advisors to create diversified portfolios for their clients.
Conveniently, all mutual fund expenses, including management and administration expenses, are built right into the net asset value of the SA Funds.
The SA Funds are an important component of Loring Ward’s Structured Investing philosophy and portfolios.
Investors should carefully consider an investment’s objectives, risks, charges, limitations and expenses. This and other information about SA Funds are in the Prospectus that should be read carefully by clients before investing. 
Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss.
Values will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost.

Loring Ward was founded with one simple, straight forward mission: to serve and support independent Advisors and their clients. We bring passion, commitment and dedication to every aspect of our business, whether it is serving as an Advisor’s complete back-office solution or helping Advisors build custom-tailored portfolios with better tools.
Loring Ward has a long history of innovation, including being one of the first firms to partner with Dimensional Fund Advisors, one of America’s most respected institutional money managers. All our portfolios are built with funds from Dimensional and/or Loring Ward’s own fund family, the SA Funds - Investment Trust , which are sub-advised by Dimensional.

We believe that Advisors and their clients—not just institutions—can benefit from the discipline and sophistication (and lower costs) that typically characterize institutional money management.
Working with some of the academic community’s most innovative and respected thinkers and economists ensures that Loring Ward is always researching tomorrow’s solutions today. Our Investment Committee includes our chief investment strategist Joni Clark, CFA, CFP®, as well as the noted behavior economist Professor Meir Statman and the 1990 Nobel Laureate for Economic Sciences, Dr. Harry Markowitz.
Loring Ward also brings the power of our experience and investment philosophy to retirement plans through, Loring Ward Total Retirement, which offers a number of retirement solutions for businesses, institutions and non-profits, including 401k, 403b and Profit Sharing plans.
This and other information about SA Funds are in the Prospectus that should be read carefully by clients before investing.

Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock Municipal Income Investment Trust’s (BBF) (the 'Trust') investment objective is to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax and Florida intangible personal property tax. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in municipal bonds exempt from
federal income taxes (except that the interest may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax). The Trust invests at least 80% of its assets in
municipal bonds that are investment grade quality at the time of investment. The Trust may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use
of derivatives. Due to the repeal of the Florida intangible personal property tax, the Board approved an amended policy in September 2008 allowing the
Trust the flexibility to invest in municipal obligations regardless of geographical location.No assurance can be given that the Trust’s investment objective will be achieved.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. 
Returns are shown net of advisory fees paid by the fund and net of the fund’s operating fees and expenses. Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

The amount the Fund is trading above or below the reported NAV expressed as a percentage of NAV. When the Fund’s closing price is greater than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Premium&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a positive number. When the Fund’s closing price is less than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Discount&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a negative number. Closing price is determined using the last traded price on the Fund’s listed exchange and NAV is calculated daily (usually 4:00pm eastern time).

Portfolio Characteristics 



Distribution Rate
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund&#39;s market price from the as-of-date. The distribution rate may include a return of capital. Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

as of 21-Jul-2017



5.74%




Tax Equiv. Yield
Tax equivalent yield (TEY) is used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond would have to earn in order to match, after taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY) = Tax Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 - Tax Rate*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, an investor in the 43.4% tax bracket would have to earn a yield of 3.53% on a taxable bond to match a 2.00% yield on a tax-exempt security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest Federal individual income tax rate of 43.4% is assumed.

as of 21-Jul-2017



10.15%




Yield to Maturity
Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond&#39;s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average YTM is the weighted average of the fund&#39;s individual bond holding YTMs based upon Net Asset Value (&#39;NAV&#39;). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, YTM is the yield-to-worst.

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.&lt;br /&gt;As the method for calculating duration in municipal bond funds changed as of Sept. 26, please see the &#39;Literature&#39; section for more information on that measure.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Notional value represents a fund’s use of derivatives, including but not limited to futures, options, and swaps. This value captures the fund exposures as if the derivative was replaced with the underlying asset and the corresponding financing or lending, such that all exposures sum to the net asset value. For non-derivatives, the market value and the notional value are identical. Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.
