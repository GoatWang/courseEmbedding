of USLD was spun-off as a public company (Billing Concepts) in August
1996 and USLD was subsequently sold in 1997. When the telecommunications
company was sold it was the eighth largest long distance company in the
United States. In October 2000 three operating entities of Billing
Concepts were sold and the company changed its name to New Century
Equity Holdings. Mr. Holmes is involved in a wide range of professional
organizations. He currently serves on the Board of Directors for Sharps
Compliance Corp., Coreintellect, Inc., Tanisys Technology, Inc. and
Princeton eCom Corporation. In June 1992, Mr. Holmes received the
‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ award for the South Texas region from Ernst &
Young, Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith, and Inc. Magazine. In
addition, Mr. Holmes was voted the ‘1999 Executive of the Year’ by the
