Elynn Diamond, Performer, Producer, Teacher/ Owner and Founder of Elynn Diamond Studio in NYCFeisty singer, impassioned songwriter, maverick entrepreneur, Angela Ai is destined to become one of the top female singer-songwriters of this decade. In an era of cloned commercialism, it takes guts for an artist to cultivate a distinct identity and Angela has definitely created some of the most powerful, original, inspired music you will hear in a long time. Angela Ai was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. Her passion for the performing arts began at the age of 5 when she began studying ballet. She studied classical piano at the age of 7 following with brief studies on the violin and flute. While in high school, she began auditioning for and was chosen to be the lead in many of the school musicals and plays. After graduating from The University of Pennsylvania (Wharton) with a degree in Finance, she moved to New York City to pursue a career in investment banking always with music in the background. "The problem is when I began calling in sick to work, I actually started getting sick!" Angela laughs. She then decided to apply to The Manhattan School of Music where she was accepted and began studying Jazz Vocal Performance with teachers including Peter Eldridge from New York Voices and Chris Rosenberg who has played regularly with Ornette Coleman. Since then, Angela has performed in some of New York's most renowned musical proving grounds including The Bottom Line, Mercury Lounge, The Cutting Room, The Bitter End, CB's Gallery and Makor. Most recently, Angela's second CD, "History", was chosen as a Performing Songwriter Magazine's DIY (Do-it-Yourself) Top-12-Pick.   ...See Full Description

Timeless, Mystical, Natural Beauty!

A naturally perfect beauty program recreated from centuries old beauty secrets and formulae.
In the late 1930’s, British singer and actress, Angela Wall, opened her exclusive beauty salon in Hanover Square, London. Her clients, who reportedly included members of the Royal Family, were treated with her own brand of all-natural beauty creams.
Legend has it that the creams were based on recipes developed centuries earlier in a convent in France. There nuns produced the creams using ingredients from the Abbey grounds and sold them to raise funds. Angela Wall improved and perfected the product and the brand name “Angela Wall” was established.
Decades later the Angela Wall of London products are manufactured exclusively in South Africa and recreated to suit today’s woman.
This ALCOHOL-FREE range has been awarded Halaal Certification, is not tested on animals and does not contain any harmful ingredients.
The basic ingredients are known, used and trusted by women throughout the ages to enhance and maintain the natural beauty of their skin.  The range is suitable for all skin types.

HONEY: Has often been described as the wonder of nature, known for its curative and restorative qualities.
ALMOND OIL: A natural emollient, rich in Vitamin A and a superb moisturizer.
ROOIBOS: A rich, natural anti-oxidant, indigenous to South Africa
It Works Naturally!
