Ex-Dividend Reminder: WGL Holdings, Quest Diagnostics and Waddell & Reed Financial


July 05, 2017, 10:03:26 AM EDT
By DividendChannel.com, BNK Invest

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , on 7/6/17, WGL Holdings Inc (Symbol: WGL), Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (Symbol: DGX), and Waddell & Reed Financial Incorporated (Symbol: WDR) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. WGL Holdings Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.51 on 8/1/17, Quest Diagnostics, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.45 on 7/24/17, and Waddell & Reed Financial Incorporated will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.46 on 8/1/17. As a percentage of WGL's recent stock price of $83.08, this dividend works out to approximately 0.61%, so look for shares of WGL Holdings Inc to trade 0.61% lower - all else being equal - when WGL shares open for trading on 7/6/17. Similarly, investors should look for DGX to open 0.41% lower in price and for WDR to open 2.42% lower, all else being equal.    Below are dividend history charts for WGL, DGX, and WDR, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.   WGL Holdings Inc (Symbol: WGL)  :       Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (Symbol: DGX)  :         Waddell & Reed Financial Incorporated (Symbol: WDR)  :          In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 2.46% for WGL Holdings Inc, 1.62% for Quest Diagnostics, Inc., and 9.67% for Waddell & Reed Financial Incorporated.    In Wednesday trading, WGL Holdings Inc shares are currently off about 0.4%, Quest Diagnostics, Inc. shares are up about 0.3%, and Waddell & Reed Financial Incorporated shares are off about 0.7% on the day.

Avista sale latest in trend of Canadian utility acquisitions
UPDATED: Fri., July 21, 2017, 9:01 a.m.


Avista’s headquarters are seen on Wednesday in Spokane. (Tyler Tjomsland / The Spokesman-Review)


            
            By 
            
                Chad Sokol chadso@spokesman.com(509) 459-5047

It was perhaps only a matter of time before Avista Corp. agreed to sell to a neighbor from the north.
Large Canadian power companies have been snapping up smaller American ones for several years, paying tens of billions of dollars to expand their geographic footprint into a country that offers lighter regulations and higher returns on investment.
Toronto-based Hydro One’s $5.3 billion pending purchase of Avista, announced Wednesday, follows major acquisitions by Canadian companies Enbridge Inc., TransCanada Corp., Fortis Inc., and Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.
Each of those deals catapulted the buyer into the leading ranks of North American utilities. If the Avista purchase passes regulatory muster – a process that may take up to a year – Hydro One’s assets will total $25.4 billion.
With the industry consolidating, a Bloomberg report about a year ago placed Avista on a list of a dozen U.S. utilities that would be likely acquisition targets. In terms of size, Avista is ranked 46th of 50 publicly traded utilities in the U.S., said Scott Morris, the company’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Also on that Bloomberg list was WGL Holdings Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based utility holding company that announced in January it’s being acquired by Calgary-based AltaGas Ltd. for $6.6 billion.
Like other Canadian buyers seeking stable investments, Hydro One was willing to pay a premium for Avista. The all-cash deal includes the assumption of Avista’s $1.9 billion debt.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the price was too high for some analysts, with Hydro One paying about 11.2 times Avista’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, more than the 9.3 average multiple for comparable deals. 
Avista’s shareholders stand to receive $53 per share, about 24 percent higher than Wednesday’s closing rate.
“That would be the highest premium paid for any company in the electric space today, so we think we did a nice job for shareholders,” Morris said.
In an interview Thursday, Morris was vague when asked whether Avista initiated the acquisition talks with Hydro One, or if there had been other offers on the table. He said only that a number of companies had inquired about potential deals over the past year and a half.
“I wouldn’t say ‘offers,’ because we were never for sale,” he said. “We never put ourselves up for sale.”
Morris said even with rate increases, it has been challenging to cover the cost of replacing decades-old power poles and transmission lines, while developing new technology for a “21st century grid.”
“For 100 years, all of the investments that we made were pipes and wires and transmission lines and generation facilities,” he said. “Very expensive capital projects, but you could spread and depreciate the cost over 30, 40, 50 years. So it worked really well. You didn’t have to have quite the scale.”
Now, he said, “most utilities are consolidating because it’s a lot easier to spread those costs” over a wider customer base.
Hydro One has about 1.3 million customers in rural Ontario, and Avista has about 700,000 customers in Eastern Washington, North Idaho and parts of Oregon and Alaska.
Morris also said the combined companies could get “more bang for our buck” when purchasing materials.
In 2015, Ontario’s ombudsman called on Hydro One to “overhaul its corporate culture” after his office received more than 10,000 complaints from ratepayers about overbilling and estimated bills. The ombudsman, André Marin, said the company provided “outrageously bad customer service” as it scrambled to fix technical glitches in its billing system, according to the CBC.
Morris said he was unconcerned about the billing issue, which arose months before Mayo Schmidt took over as Hydro One’s CEO. The problem also resulted in a $125 million class action lawsuit, which is still being litigated, and the company says the glitches were quickly fixed.
“They installed their new customer billing system, much like we did,” Morris said. “Unfortunately for them – it was before Mayo’s time – it didn’t go very well. They made some mistakes. It was tough technology. … They are making it right with people.”
Morris also stressed that the acquisition would have no effect on electricity rates or jobs, and that it would more than double Avista’s charitable giving.
“Our intentions were to make sure that this gem of a company stayed a gem of a company, with local control, local management, making local decisions, for the right reasons for our customers,” he said. “In many ways, we have locked in our values, our culture.”
Editor’s note: This story was changed on July 21, 2017. A previous version incorrectly stated which day Morris was interviewed by The Spokesman-Review.

History[edit]




Washington Gas logo


Genesis[edit]
Washington, D.C., was decades slower than some other eastern U.S. cities to move from candles or oil to gas for lighting. Baltimore was first, in 1816; New York City was partially lighted with gas in 1825.[citation needed] In 1840, when a gas company for Washington remained only a proposal, a U.S. Senate document argued for gas' salutary effect on the local economy: "fancy and other stores would introduce this light, and thus add to the cheerfulness of the public ways."[citation needed]
Among the early proponents of gas was James Crutchett, who bought a house north of the Capitol grounds and lit it with gas. This drew the attention of Congress, which voted him $17,500 to light up the Capitol and helped encourage public support for wider use of gas.
A supporter of Crutchett's ideas was Benjamin B. French, Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives, who helped attract other important supporters, including William A. Bradley, the city's postmaster and mayor; John F. Callan, a druggist; his brother Michael P. Callan, a Post Office clerk; hardware merchant William H. Harrover; William H. English, a Treasury clerk who became a Congressman from Indiana and later a Vice-Presidential candidate; and Jacob Bigelow, an attorney and abolitionist who later helped escaped slave Ann Maria Weems.[3]
Two petitions were sent to Congress in April 1848, and on July 8 of that year, lawmakers issued the first Congressional charter for a company that would extract gas from coal.[citation needed] At last, the nation's capital had its first gas company, the Washington Gas Light Company.[4] The company was established on the tenth street of the Foggy Bottom neighborhood, and eventually led to the area's urbanization.[citation needed]
1850-1900[edit]
George Washington Riggs became the president of the company in 1856. Two years later, the company began to build a new, more efficient factory, the West Station Works, between 26th and G Streets NW.
Meanwhile, a new plant was constructed in Foggy Bottom in 1858 at the intersection of New Hampshire and Virginia avenues NW. This location, at the head of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, gave it access to barges carrying coal from West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
These plants changed the neighborhood. Between 1830 and 1860, the percentage of "skilled laborers" in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood declined from 44% to 23%, while the percentage of "unskilled laborers" rose to 44%. [5]
During the American Civil War, coal and transportation grew scarce. “The cost of making gas increased one hundred and twenty-five percent, and another problem appeared when Congress reduced the gas rate seventeen percent.”[6] The company sought help from the Secretary of War and from President Abraham Lincoln, who he wrote to John W. Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, asking him to “bring coal to the city and afford the continuation of the necessary gas lighting.”[7] Production levels for gas went down during the Civil War, they soon returned to normal.
In the 1870s, several large holding tanks (gasometers) were erected at the Foggy Bottom site.
In 1878, Thomas Edison introduced the incandescent lamp, a threat to the company.
In 1891, one of the gasometers exploded; the cause was attributed to a large storm.[8]
20th century[edit]
Gas furnaces began to appear in 1915; some remain in use today.[9]
In 1947, the industry expanded to 22 million customers.[10] [11]
The Foggy Bottom plant operated until the 1950s. In 1964, the Washington Gas Light Company sold development rights for the location in a deal that stipulated that the new structure would be supplied exclusively by the company. [12] The last building of the Watergate was completed in 1971.
In 1997, in response to newly deregulated gas and energy markets, Washington Gas formed Washington Gas Resources Corp to serve as a holding company for non-utility subsidiaries. Also in 1997, the company created an unregulated energy company, Washington Gas Energy Services, as a subsidiary of that holding company.[13] Washington Gas Energy Services started with just a handful of customers and as of 2014 had grown into an $8.0 million company. [14]
Present day[edit]
Nineteenth-century traces of the gas company include the Civil War-era aqueduct across Rock Creek Park between the Georgetown and Foggy Bottom neighborhoods.
Gas and electric streetlamps installed by the company can still be found in Georgetown, on the main streets near Virginia and New Hampshire Avenues, and even past Foggy Bottom.
In 2013, the company rebranded itself as WGL with the goal of "being a new kind of energy company: answer-oriented, technology and data driven, responsive and built for the complex energy markets of today and tomorrow".[15] This rebrand included the renaming of Washington Gas Energy Services to WGL Energy and the inclusion of the term "a WGL Company" under the traditional Washington Gas logo.[citation needed] WGL's stock rose 26% over 2016.[16] On January 25, 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Canadian natural gas company AltaGas Ltd. had agreed to acquire WGL Holdings Inc. for $6.4 billion. The deal, subject to various approvals, is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018.[16]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
