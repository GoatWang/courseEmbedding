GeneCards Suite Premium Tools






NGS Phenotyper


Gene Set Analysis


GeneCards Batch Queries






LifeMap's GeneCards Suite premium tools are a set of biomedical data analysis applications that leverage the GeneCards Suite knowledgebase for gene variant prioritization and RNAseq and microarray gene set analysis to deliver enhanced results, including from the unprecedented quantities of data derived from next generation sequencing (“NGS”).  The premium tools include VarElect, the NGS phenotyper, GeneAnalytics™, a novel gene set analysis tool, and GeneALaCart, the GeneCards batch querying application.
GeneCards Suite premium tools - powered by LifeMap’s GeneCards Suite integrated biomedical knowledgebase, which includes GeneCards®, the leading human gene database, MalaCards, the human disease database, and LifeMap Discovery®, the tissues and cells database.  






VarElect - 
					NGS Phenotyper


VarElect is an extremely effective, user- friendly, and affordable tool for the rapid prioritization of gene variants identified by next generation sequencing experiments according to their potential associations with specific diseases or /phenotypes of interest. VarElect leverages the rich information within the LifeMap GeneCards Suite integrated knowledgebase of GeneCards®, the leading human gene database,  MalaCards, the human disease database, and  LifeMap Discovery®, the tissues and cells database. Powered by this knowledgebase, VarElect can prioritize a list of hundreds of genes with variants and narrow it down to the top 1-10 genes that are potentially associated with a particular disease, phenotype, or other biological function, within seconds.

GeneAnalytics - 
					Gene Set Analysis


GeneAnalytics™ is a powerful and easy-to-use gene set analysis tool that can rapidly contextualize NGS derived gene variants and RNAseq and microarray derived gene expression patterns and function signatures in experimental data.  It leverages LifeMap's comprehensive integrated biomedical knowledgebase, the GeneCards Suite, comprised of GeneCards®, MalaCards,  and LifeMap Discovery®, which utilizes data from more than 100 sources. Leveraging this extensive biomedical knowledgebase enables GeneAnalytics to effectively identify cell and tissue types and various human diseases that match experimental gene sets based on shared or similar gene expression patterns. GeneAnalytics can also identify diseases, biological pathways, and compounds that are associated with experimental gene sets based on shared gene functionality. Furthermore, GeneAnalytics presents the analysis results intuitively, with interactive links to supporting data and additional further information.

GeneAlaCart - 
					GeneCards Batch Queries


GeneALaCart generates a file of GeneCards annotations associated with your list of genes. For each query, you supply the "batch" of gene identifiers and select the annotations that interest you; GeneALaCart then extracts the information from GeneCards, and produces a customized results file.
