Load ring for lifting by elevator, of casing having an upset



Patent number:  9567815
                                            

Abstract:  A load lifting apparatus comprises a first housing, a second housing and a mechanical obstruction structure(s). The first housing is sized to slide over an upset tubular having a given diameter, wherein the first housing comprises the mechanical obstruction structure(s) that is designed to move radially inward when engaged with the second housing. The compressed internal diameter of the mechanical obstruction structure(s) can contact the upset tubular, wherein the upset tubular can then be supported by the mechanical obstruction structure(s) and the second housing, for safely lifting the upset tubular.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Load ring for lifting by elevator, of cassing having no upset



Patent number:  8936292
                                            

Abstract:  A cylindrical ring sized to slide over the box end of an oilfield tubular having a given diameter, has a shoulder at one its ends and a sidewall along its length. The sidewall has a circumferential groove about its interior surface housing a band which can be made tight against the exterior surface of the oilfield tubular by a latch accessible through a slot in the sidewall, and which becomes even tighter if the tubular attempts to escape from the band. In a first orientation, the cylindrical ring is used as a load ring. By turning the cylindrical rings upside down, the cylindrical ring is used as a thread protector for the pin end of the tubular.

METHODS AND MULTI-PURPOSE APPARATUS FOR DISPENSING AND CIRCULATING FLUID IN WELLBORE CASING



Publication number:  20140224473
                                            

Abstract:  A multi-functional apparatus and method for drilling fluid and cementing operations to set casing in a wellbore for use on either top drive or rotary type rigs. The apparatus and method includes a fill-up and circulating tool, a cementing head assembly, and a wiper plug assembly. The fill-up and circulating tool comprises a mandrel with a sealing element disposed about the outside diameter of the mandrel. The cementing head and wiper plug assemblies are useable on any fill-up and circulating tool capable of being inserted into a casing. To fill the casing, the assembly is lowered from the rig such that a portion of the fill-up tools inserted into the casing, the pumps are then actuated to flow fluid into the casing. To circulate fluid, the tool is lowered further such that the sealing element sealingly engages the inside diameter of the casing to allow fluid to flow through the casing, into the wellbore, and back to the fluid pumps.

Load ring for lifting by elevator, of casing having no upset



Patent number:  8348320
                                            

Abstract:  Methods for gripping an oilfield tubular include engaging a band with a ring member to form a load ring. The band has an arcuate component with a gap separating first and second ends, an interior surface, and an inclined exterior surface. The ring member has an interior surface with a groove therein. The inclined exterior surface of the band is associated with the groove of the interior surface to form the load ring. The load ring can be engaged with an oilfield tubular, and a force can be applied such that the groove of the ring member engages the inclined exterior surface of the band for securing the load ring to the oilfield tubular.

Abstract:  Embodiments disclosed herein relate to a downhole tool and a method to abate vibration with the downhole tool. The downhole tool may include a first stabilizing member, a second stabilizing member, a flexible member, and/or a dampening member, in which the downhole tool may be disposed downhole within a wellbore. The flexible member may enable the first stabilizing member and the second stabilizing member to articulate with respect to an axis of the downhole tool. The dampening member may enable vibration received by the downhole tool to be dampened. Further, the first stabilizing member and the second stabilizing member may be rotatable with respect to each other about the axis of the downhole tool.

Flow control apparatus and method



Patent number:  RE41979
                                            

Abstract:  A fluid flow control apparatus for use in a mid-string location in a pipe string being run into a well has an open fluid flow route to the annulus above the apparatus to provide more flow area for upwardly moving fluid. Flow up the upper pipe string bore is resisted to reduce fluid overflow from the top of the pipe string. Fluid flow down the pipe string bore closes the fluid channel between the lower pipe string bore and the upper annulus and blows out a pipe bore flow resisting element for free down flow of fluids in the pipe string bore.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
