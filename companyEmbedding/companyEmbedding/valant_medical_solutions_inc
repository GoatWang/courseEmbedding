Save time with Valant


Integration = Efficiency

When you’re treating multiple patients per hour, time is of the essence. Our clinical notes are pre-populated with information from the patient, chart, portal, and calendar, so you won’t spend time duplicating information but rather get your notes done faster.


Reduce Liability

Our documentation tools are built to fulfill the standards of the highest paying E/M codes. With a documentation tracker built right into the dashboard, you can keep track of the clinical notes you still need to complete, right when you sign in.


Built for Psychiatry

We are designed specifically for behavioral health, and only behavioral health. Certified for 2014 Meaningful Use and integrated with e-prescribing and EPCS, our EHR is a tailored fit for your psychiatric practice.











See Valant in Action

Key Workflows:


Automate Your Intake Assessments
Get a jump on a high-quality clinical note before your patient ever steps into your office! By engaging patients securely with technology, Valant enables you to begin gathering valuable clinical information, such as an extensive history of present illness, from the moment you schedule the first appointment.
Key Benefits:


Better data at your fingertips and in your notes 
Cut the paper out of your process




Improve clinical time with the patient in session 
Set up every patient for successful outcomes













Technology to Improve Outcomes
Measuring the outcomes of your patient care is not only recommended by the DSM-5 but also a core component of Valant. Structured screeners and questionnaires help better focus your face-to-face time with your patient, and more easily meet the E/M requirements for your notes.
Measure and enhance your patient care:


Collect data naturally and track automatically
Measure patient baseline to improve their outcomes




Accountability without extra data entry
Defend and improve your reimbursement rates










Save Time on Psychiatric Notes
Valant provides multiple options to extensively document your psychiatric cases while reducing the inherent hassle and burden at the same time. By automatically generating narrative and leveraging your data into each note, you’ll get the job done more quickly and thoroughly than ever before. 
An integrated note makes all the difference:


Incorporate rich patient data
Save time & reduce typing




Higher level E/M coding when appropriate
Higher quality documentation













Manage Medications Anytime, Anywhere 
Valant has integrated your prescribing responsibilities directly into our natural clinical workflow. Check, refill, and renew meds the moment you sign in right from your dashboard, the note in session, the chart afterwards, or your smartphone on the go. Connect to your records and pharmacies whenever, wherever.
eRx optimized for the busy psychiatric provider:


Send scripts with less data entry
Decrease prescribing errors




Built-in alerts and reports
Electronically prescribe controlled substances (EPCS)










Integrate the Management of Your Practice
Whether you are backed by a full compliment of staff or are a one-person show, practice management has never been simpler. Valant is tailored to keep your administration organized, starting with your scheduling, flowing through your clinical work, and into all aspects of billing and business reports.
See what true integration can do for you:


Straightforward coding and charge creation trims extra steps to get you paid faster
Easy to see and track progress for what needs to be done




Actionable reports on clinical, clerical, and financial functions 
Reduce risks and liabilities to give you peace of mind
















Testimonials













“I was resistant to EHRs, I was still using paper and pen and charts and probably not documenting very well. When it became clear to me my documentation was not adequate and that I was putting myself at risk, it became time to look at an integrated system… It is clear it Valant was designed for a psychiatrist and support is great. I’m not a big computer geek, this system is perfect for people not so comfortable. Going to Valant didn’t require a huge learning curve.”
- Andrew Compaine, MD





“In documenting psychiatric cases, Valant has multiple options for my note taking and record keeping specific to psychiatry that help keep it organized and focused in what I’m interested in and what I need to do.
Oh  and my billers love Valant! It’s quick to learn quick for them to reconcile payments and I get paid quickly. Tax time is coming, I can look up how I collected in cash so I can add that to my income. It’s very easy for me to do the reporting myself with very few clicks, just by looking at the system, there is nothing I had to learn or study”
- Philip Malinas, MD





“Before I had three different systems, one for scheduling, one for EHR, one for billing, and we were always having to update people in multiple systems and it was just terrible. This is an integrated system, it works really smoothly, the to-do list keeps me organized. It’s very easy to see where billing is, it’s very easy to see when medication refills need to happen, I couldn’t be more pleased.
The system is so intuitive, once we got the patient data loaded, we’ve had no problem since. It was easy, simple, and the support I get from the folks at the Valant office is superb.”
- John Fleming, MD

Nearly everyone on both the customer facing and internal teams were great. Company and mission are fascinating, and having a CEO with hands-on industry knowledge is big boon. The office is pretty centrally located and easy to get to, and there's lots of food and coffee options in the area. Compensation/benefits are reasonable and fair for a young, smaller company.Cons- Priorities of the company in pushing the new product appear to be strongly influenced by Board of Directors/investors seeking to recoup investments immediately rather than letting the product grow to where it needs to be. The sales apparatus has the same problems that sales has always had since time immemorial - overpromise clients to close deals, then immediately disappear from the clients' life, leaving support and engineering to clean up messes.- Some core functions of the product management team appear to have been hijacked by other teams/departments - we were told that certain customer facing personnel would be gathering and prioritizing features/functionality. Currently the product management team has been largely relegated to crunching highly technical documents, a task better suited for those with deep industry knowledge or someone in a traditional "technical/business analyst" role.- Current state of installation/implementation for new clients is terrifying. There is very little process, which results in multiple departments getting overly involved and inevitable turf wars. Company currently lacks both technical analysts and implementation consultants, two roles which are absolutely vital if they plan to be widely selling and installing the new product.- Company has hired some overseas staff and looks to add more - it's disheartening to see the company going overseas to underpay someone when there's so much engineering talent locally available in Seattle.Advice to Management- Make an honest assessment of where the product stands and how feasible the goals are regarding "X live clients by Y date" metrics.- Hire technical analysts and business/implementation consultants- Develop a comprehensive implementation plan for new clients (this would require hiring some of the above-mentioned resources)- Return product management team to its traditional functions. Right now what the product team is being asked to do is not what anyone in the industry would recognize as the accepted role of a product manager, and the company risks losing more product staff over what they're being asked to do.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Valant Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Valant 2016-02-23 10:25 PST Feb 25, 2016 Helpful (7)"Not recommended"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Manager in Seattle, WAFormer Employee - Manager in Seattle, WADoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at Valant full-time (More than a year)ProsGood location, nice people.

The Platform for Behavioral Health
Learn more











We’ve seen technology advance and improve lives all around us. Except in behavioral health. Why is that? Why not experience the same usability you experience with your smartphone with your workflows? Why not experience the latest in data infrastructure technology to make your data more reportable and actionable? We believe behavioral health care deserves better. Introducing Valant: the platform for behavioral health.


Request a  Demo





Reinventing the EHR


Built for the Future

Behavioral health is the lever for healthcare transformation. You need the right technology partner to help you take the lead. Integrated care, care management, and interoperability demand better technology and we’re challenging the status quo. 


You don’t need an EHR

Outdated EHR technology can no longer keep up with the changing requirements of behavioral health care. The Valant Platform combines domain knowledge and technological expertise to exceed the capabilities of EHRs.


Get Paid

Valant allows you to choose workflows from a content library full of Evidence Based Practices. The flexible and extensible data model enables you to extract, report and visualize data easily in real-time. Improve business and clinical performance; position your organization to deliver value.











Overwhelmed by Technology Jargon?


The “EHR Technology Buzzwords” ebook breaks down the most common technology jargon used by EHR vendors, provides clear, easy to understand definitions, and describes how they relate to an EHR. While not everyone can be a CIO or CTO, being familiar with basic EHR technology terms will empower organizations to successfully select the best and most effective EHR to suit their needs and overall goals.

What makes us different


Extensible data Model
Data is a powerful tool that has the potential to significantly improve care for your clients and the health of your business. But so much data collected by EHRs sits idle because current technology limits the extraction and visualization of the data. Our platform takes a data first approach.
Our platform, your data


It’s your data. We make it secure and accessible
New care models made possible




Extractable, Actionable, Reportable. All on demand
No cost for actionable data













Mobile app-inspired user experience
Valant’s sleek and modern user interface is designed to be as intuitive as your smartphone and persona-driven to easily tame complex processes and guide multi-step tasks. The result is a non-invasive documentation process, better care coordination across multiple clinicians, and better data collection.
How you’ll benefit:


Clinicians will actually use the product
Intuitive, requires little or no training




Guided protocols, better outcomes
Collect high quality data










Forget Customization - Think Configuration
You have to report performance against a constantly changing landscapes of measures, respond quickly to business opportunities and risks, all in parallel to client care. You don’t have the time to wait for your EHR vendor to spend months customizing and coding a field needed for a new Medicaid regulation, and shouldn't pay an arm and a leg for it either. 
Why is Valant different?


On demand response to change request
No hard coding or bolt-on custom software




Infinitely scalable
No additional cost, training, or productivity loss













Go-live Model
Valant uses an iterative, agile, and highly interactive approach to your launch. We call this our Progressive Demo Go-Live model. Because of the flexibility and extensibility of Valant’s platform, we are able to significantly reduce the time it takes for your organization to achieve full user-adoption. 
How you’ll benefit:


No more 2 year implementations! 
Maintain productivity through the go-live process 




Reduce the burden on your clinicians and staff
No disruption of services 

















             
            We think you'll love the
