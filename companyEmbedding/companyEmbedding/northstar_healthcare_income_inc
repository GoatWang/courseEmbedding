Investment  Approach











REITs at a Glance
A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a company that pools the money of many investors and purchases a diversified, professionally-managed portfolio of commercial real estate assets. REITs are legally required to pay 90 percent of taxable income as dividends and, therefore, have the potential to provide attractive streams of income.1
There are various types of REITs. One way in which REITs vary is by the type of investments they hold. Similar to stocks and bonds, debt-focused REITs and equity-focused REITs have different risk and return characteristics. Holding both in an investment portfolio may help reduce overall portfolio risk.2
Debt-Focused REITs
Instead of buying properties directly, debt-focused REITs provide capital to finance commercial real estate properties. These REITs typically generate income from contractually agreed upon interest payments and are less vulnerable to changing economic conditions, however, if the borrower lacks sufficient funds, distributions may be delayed or not made.
Often, debt-focused REITs emphasize income generation and preservation of capital and tend to offer better protection against declines in real estate property values than equity-focused REITs.
Equity-Focused REITs
Equity-focused REITs acquire, manage, operate and sell commercial real estate properties. They generate revenue from rent which is the contractual obligation of the tenant. Once debt service costs and all expenses have been paid, equity-focused REITs make distributions to investors. During periods of economic pressure, demand for space may fall and rents may drop, causing the income that equity-focused REITs provide, and the value of the properties they hold, to decline. During periods of prosperity, equity-focused REITs may offer the opportunity for growth in investor capital when economic conditions cause property values to rise.
REITs also vary in the ways in which they are bought and sold.
Publicly-Traded REITs are bought and sold on national securities exchanges and are more liquid than non-traded REITs. Because they are publicly traded they move up and down with the markets and are subject to the same market fluctuations and volatility as other exchange-traded stocks.
Public, Non-Traded REITs do not trade on exchanges and are not subject to the volatility of the markets.3 Non-traded REITs may pay higher distributions than publicly-traded REITs; although they may also experience less capital appreciation.1 In addition, non-traded REITs have limited liquidity and lack price transparency in comparison with publicly-traded REITs.
How Non-Traded REITs Work
 
1) There is no guarantee of distributions. Distributions have been paid from sources other than cash flow from operations, including offering proceeds, which may reduce an investor’s overall return. Publicly-traded REITs do not typically pay distributions using offering proceeds. There is no guarantee of any return and you may lose a part or all of your investment. 2) There is no guarantee that asset allocation will assure a profit or protect against loss in a broadly declining market. 3) Non-traded REITs, like publicly traded REITs, remain subject to the risk of declining values resulting from changes related to the fundamentals of the company and its underlying properties.

Who We Are
NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc.
NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. (NorthStar Healthcare) is a public, non-traded real estate investment trust (REIT) that was formed to originate, acquire and asset manage equity and debt investments in healthcare real estate. Specifically, NorthStar Healthcare is focused on making investments in the needs-driven senior housing sector, which we define as independent living facilities, assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing facilities. We believe this sector is an attractive asset class to invest in as these types of facilities generally provide the broadest level of services to residents in a more cost effective setting.NorthStar Healthcare, with its experience, relationships and vision, is ideally positioned to capitalize both as an equity investor and lender in this industry and provide investors an opportunity for both income and long-term growth.
NorthStar Securities, LLC

NorthStar Securities, LLC is dedicated to providing financial advisors and their clients with tools to make informed investment decisions.
1) There is no guarantee of distributions. Distributions have been paid and may continue to be paid from sources other than cash flow from operations, such as offering proceeds, borrowings or sales of assets and distributions may exceed earnings. We have paid distributions in excess of our cash flow provided by operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we declared distributions of $30,897,000 compared to cash flow provided by operations of $3,496,000. The remaining $27,401,000, or 88.7%, was paid used offering proceeds, including the purchase of additional shares by our sponsor, which reduces the amount we can invest in income-producing assets and your overall return may be reduced. Distributions have also exceeded our net loss of $(27,079,000) for the same period. Fees paid to the advisor were not determined on an arm’s length basis and reduce the amount the program can invest in income-producing assets and your overall return may be reduced. 2) Diversification does not eliminate risk and does not assure better performance. As with any real estate investment, there are various risks including but not limited to: unfavorable market conditions, loss of principal and limited liquidity.

In connection with the acquisition, NorthStar Healthcare also originated a $75.0 million mezzanine loan to partially finance the transaction, which bears interest at a fixed rate of 10.0% per year and has a term of 67 months.
