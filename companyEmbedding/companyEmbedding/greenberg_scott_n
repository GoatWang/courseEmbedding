Lakemont Plastic Surgery & Laser Center
Serving Orlando, Winter Park and Nearby Areas of Florida 

Ask Dr.
Greenberg
  






At Lakemont Plastic Surgery & Laser Center in Orlando, we make patient safety, comprehensive patient education, and excellence in care our priorities. Patient safety and great results go hand in hand because they both rest on the same foundations: a properly equipped facility and a highly skilled and well-trained plastic surgeon. 
The Excellence in Care You Deserve
Meet Dr. Scott A. Greenberg and understand more about our practice at Lakemont Plastic Surgery & Laser Center in this video.


Dr. Greenberg is an internationally trained and board-certified plastic surgeon.  With medical training, residencies, and fellowships in New Orleans, Boston, Norfolk, Virginia, Akron, Ohio, and Israel, Dr. Greenberg has amassed the medical knowledge necessary to give you the best possible care and results. He is a respected cosmetic surgeon, a clinical instructor, lecturer, and published author of scientific articles.
Select from the Most Popular Cosmetic Procedures
Breast Augmentation
Breast augmentation continues to be the most popular procedure among plastic surgery patients. For our younger patients, breast augmentation provides breast fullness that enhances your natural body shape. For patients who have lost breast volume over time or due to pregnancy, breast augmentation can return an ample, youthful shape to the breasts.
Liposuction
Liposuction is another extremely popular, safe, and effective procedure that helps our patients achieve the body contours that diet and exercise alone can’t provide. Although liposuction is not a weight loss tool, it is a very effective procedure for eliminating stubborn fat pockets to achieve smoother, more toned body contours. 
Facial Rejuvenation
From facelifts to lip enhancements to BOTOX® injections, we offer patients a wide variety of surgical and non-surgical facial rejuvenation options to suit your individual needs. For patients who may not need plastic surgery yet, our non-surgical options are a great choice to refresh your appearance for a more youthful look.
Accredited Surgical Facility
Procedures are performed in our accredited surgical facility staffed by our fully trained and certified staff.  If necessary or requested by you, we can also perform your procedure at Winter Park Memorial Hospital, directly adjacent to our suite.
Call Dr. Greenberg Today for Your Consultation
Don't sacrifice quality or safety in your cosmetic surgery.  You have just one body: entrust it only to a person with the skill and training necessary to guarantee the lowest possible risk and the highest likelihood of great results.

Facelift

Face lifts are performed on patients as they age to restore a youthful look. In general, a face lift will lift your sagging cheeks, help to eliminate jowls, and remove the redundant skin and fat from the neck.

Eyelid Surgery

The eyelids are often the first areas to show signs of aging. Dr. Greenberg uses state-of-the-art technology to correct your droopy upper lids and puffy bags below your eyes.
See More








Rhinoplasty

Dr. Greenberg performs this procedure on many teens and adults every week. Rhinoplasty can now be performed to look natural, without the "operated on" appearance to the nose. 
See More








Otoplasty

Ear surgery (otoplasty) is a procedure that is performed to set back prominent ears closer to your head or to reduce the size of your ears. Dr. Greenberg performs ear plastic surgery on many children, as well as adults.

Laser Skin Resurfacing

In laser skin resurfacing, sometimes called "laser peel," a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser is used to remove areas of damaged or wrinkled skin, layer by layer. The laser resurfacing procedure is most commonly used to minimize the appearance of fine lines, especially around the mouth and the eyes.

Forehead Lift

A forehead lift will remove or reduce horizontal creases across the forehead, furrows between the eyebrows and sagging eyebrows. Due to the aging process, genetics, stress or muscle activity, facial muscles and tissues can loose elasticity causing wrinkles and furrowed lines. 
See More








Chin Surgery

Genioplasty or chin augmentation is a surgical procedure to reshape or increase the size of the chin for better projection and appearance. It can balance the profile by extending the chin in relationship to the nose. 
See More








Threadlift™

ThreadLifts utilize Contour Threads, which are clear, safe sutures that have tiny barbs, or cogs in them. Inserted under the skin, Contour Threads are fixated with tension that creates a suspension effect that gently lifts sagging tissues.
See More








Fat Transfer

Fat cells can be removed from one area of the body, and relocated to areas of the face to fill creases and wrinkles. The added volume looks soft and natural, taking years off your face and helping you to look young and vibrant.
See More








Mole Removal

Mole removal and excision of benign or malignant skin lesions is a very common prodecure in the United States. Dr. Greenberg performs these procedures every week using only the latest technology. He will ensure that moles or skin lesions are benign by having them checked by a biopsy, when necessary.
See More








Necklift

If you suffer from excess skin, fat, or jowls, or a general lack of definition, Dr. Greenberg can smooth, tighten, and enhance the appearance of your neck. We use a combination of platysmaplasty to reshape the neck muscle, liposuction to remove fat, and cervicoplasty to reduce skin. Dr. Greenberg can often use endoscopic techniques which use smaller incisions than traditional surgery. With minimal risks and a short recovery time, a necklift is an excellent treatment option to help you achieve a beautiful neck.
See More








Lip Augmentation

Lip augmentation can be used to plump up and create full, youthful-looking, sensual lips. Through the use of implants, injectable fillers, or fat transfer, we can restore the youthful look to your lips and provide a wonderful cosmetic enhancement. This procedure can especially benefit those patients whose lips have thinned or wrinkled from the aging process.
See More








Cheek Augmentation

Cheek augmentation can be used to add volume and contouring for patients who desire more facial definition. This highly customizable treatment plan can incorporate cheek implants, dermal fillers, or fat transfer grafts to create a smooth, natural look. This simple procedure can provide a dramatic aesthetic enhancement with very little downtime for recovery.
