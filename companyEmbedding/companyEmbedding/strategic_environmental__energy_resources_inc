Management Commentary

"The first quarter of 2017 concluded on a strong up swing as all of our divisions displayed notable quarter-over-quarter, top-line revenue growth," said SEER's CEO, John Combs. "We delivered solid operating results in our environmental technology and material divisions. This confirms our commitment to growing this higher-margin and recurring revenue side of the SEER business. 
"We are particularly pleased with the progress MV Technologies made in the first quarter of 2017 with revenues up 195% to $1.7 million This also represented the highest revenue growth segment at SEER: $0.4 million in new purchase orders for our H2SPlus, Hydrogen Sulfide Removal System and higher-margin SEM revenues were generated in the first quarter. We expect to continue growing this important component of our environmental technology solutions as our number of installations increase nationwide along with our new product media sales. We are particularly focused on immediately leveraging our enhanced and expanded board of directors to increase our MV LFG installations and associated media sales.
"Our service offerings remain important and Tactical revenue continued its upward trajectory reaffirming our belief that a material turnaround is in place. REGS also made progress during the first quarter, driven in large part by the introduction of our new chemical cleaning services and our recent success in securing new customers both within and outside of the oil and gas sectors.
"The momentum is continuing in the second quarter with our patented fugitive emission capture systems, the V3RU™ and the V3RU Plus™ systems. As we announced recently, we are aggressively targeting the Canadian market with our new partner, Innovative Energy Technologies. Initially, the collective efforts will be focused to deploy the fugitive emission capture technologies in major oil and gas fields located in Western Canada, particularly the Lloydminster area. Phase I will be to deploy its V3RU systems and Phase II will be to introduce the V3RU Plus system that not only captures emissions, but also produces natural gas liquids for resale or beneficial uses in oil field operations. In Canada, these programs are currently much more developed and economically rewarding when compared to the U.S. and we believe this market represents an imminent and potentially very lucrative opportunity for the Company and our new Canadian partners," continued Combs. 
"Finally, and most important, yesterday we announced a major enhancement to our board and executive suite by appointing former USA Waste Services Chairman and CEO, Donald Moorehead, as Chairman of the SEER board of directors and CEO of Paragon Waste Solutions. Don's appointment represents one of the most important milestones in SEER's operating history to date and we believe the company is well positioned to make available to Mr. Moorehead a unique portfolio of assets that will enable him to leverage his 30 years of successful acquisitions and mergers as well as decades of stellar operations across all aspects of waste markets worldwide. The company's initial focus will be to provide Mr. Moorehead with several patented technologies to change the way medical waste is handled in the U.S. and abroad (Paragon) as well as capture market share in the LFG space (MV). We couldn't be more excited to start the next phase of our growth cycle for our disruptive CoronaLux technology and our MV LFG environmental technology solutions technologies," concluded Combs. 

First Quarter 2017 Financial Results

Total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 increased 20% to $4.2 million compared to $3.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. This increase is primarily driven by an increase of approximately $1.1 million in environmental solutions revenue, partially offset by a $0.4 million reduction in service revenue.
Industrial and Railcar Cleaning revenue in the first quarter of 2017 totaled $2.4 million versus $2.9 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in the number of railcars serviced is due to the railcar industry transitioning to transporting other liquid products as a result of the downturn in the oil and gas market, thus increasing service opportunities.
Environmental Solutions revenue in the first quarter of 2017 totaled $1.7 million versus $0.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in the environmental solutions revenue is due to greater long term contract revenue, one time revenue and recurring media sales to new and existing customers. 
Solid Waste (PWS) revenue in the first quarter of 2017 totaled $69,300 versus $71,600 in the same year-ago quarter.
Gross margins in the first quarter of 2017 decreased to 27.9% from 38.3% in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross margin is largely attributable to a decrease in the utilization of manpower in the services division. 
Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 grew to at $4.2 million compared to $3.4 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in operating costs is primarily the result of the 175% increase in environmental solutions revenue resulting in a 220% increase in environmental solutions costs, and an increase in industrial and railcar cleaning services costs of approximately $0.1 million.
Net loss attributable to SEER in the first quarter of 2017 totaled $0.4 million or ($0.01) per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.1 million or $0.00 per diluted share in the same year-ago quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017 totaled $0.3 million, compared to $0.4 million in the same year-ago quarter. (See definition and further discussion about the presentation of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, below).
Cash at March 31, 2017, totaled $0.3 million compared to $0.2 million at December 31, 2016.
Further details about the company's results in the first quarter of 2017 are available in its Quarterly Report Form 10-Q, accessible in the investor relations section of the company's website at www.seer-corp.com.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and the results of our operations. It should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report as well as our Report on Form 10K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016. Certain statements made in our discussion may be forward looking. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from our expectations. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, among others, the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as other risks described in this Quarterly Report. Unless the context requires otherwise, when we refer to "we," "us" and "our," we are describing Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  SEER BUSINESS OVERVIEW  Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc. ("the Company" or "SEER") was originally organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 13, 2002 for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses, under the name of Satellite Organizing Solutions, Inc ("SOZG"). In January 2008, SOZG changed its name to Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc., reduced its number of outstanding shares through a reverse stock split and consummated the acquisition of both, REGS, LLC and Tactical Cleaning Company, LLC. SEER is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental, clean-technology businesses that provide safe, innovative, cost effective, and profitable solutions in the oil & gas, environmental, waste management and renewable energy industries. SEER currently operates six companies with five offices in the western and mid-western U.S. Through these operating companies, SEER provides products and services throughout the U.S. and has licensed technologies with many customer installations throughout the U.S. Each of the six operating companies is discussed in more detail below. The Company also has non-controlling interests in joint ventures, some of which have no or minimal operations.  The Company's domestic strategy is to grow internally through SEER's subsidiaries that have well established revenue streams and, simultaneously, establish long-term alliances with and/or acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for renewable energy, waste and water treatment and oil & gas services. The focus of the SEER family of companies, however is to increase margins by securing or developing proprietary patented and patent-pending technologies and then leveraging its 20 plus-year service experience to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets of emission capture and control, renewable "green gas" capture and sale, compressed natural gas ("CNG") fuel generation, as well as general solid waste and medical/pharmaceutical waste destruction. Many of SEER's current operating companies share customer bases and each provides truly synergistic services, technologies and products as well as annuity type revenue streams.  The Company now owns and manages five operating entities and one entity that has no significant operations to date.  Subsidiaries  REGS, LLC d/b/a Resource Environmental Group Services ("REGS"): (operating since 1994) provides general industrial cleaning services and waste management to many industry sectors focusing primarily on oil & gas production (upstream) and refineries (downstream).  Tactical Cleaning Company, LLC ("Tactical"): (operating since 2005) provides cleaning services to the tanker rail car industry with offices in two states and a focus on both food-grade and petroleum based products, i.e., fuel oil and asphalt. Tactical has recently been permitted to operate a flare at its Kansas facility and will be expanding its operations in 2016 to include the cleaning of gas and propane rail cars.  MV, LLC (d/b/a MV Technologies), ("MV"): (operating since 2003) MV designs and sells patented and/or proprietary, dry scrubber solutions for management of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) in biogas, landfill gas, and petroleum processing operations. These system solutions are marketed under the product names H2SPlus(TM) and OdorFilter(TM). The markets for these products include land fill operations, agricultural and food product processors, wastewater treatment facilities, and petroleum product refiners. MV also develops and designs proprietary technologies and systems used to condition biogas for use as renewable natural gas ("RNG"), for a number of applications, such as transportation fuel and natural gas pipeline injection.  Paragon Waste Solutions, LLC ("PWS"): (formed late 2010) PWS is an operating company that has developed a patented waste destruction technology using a pyrolytic heating process combined with "non-thermal plasma" assisted oxidation. This technique involves gasification of solid waste by heating the waste in a low-oxygen environment, followed by complete oxidation at higher temperatures in the presence of plasma. The term "non-thermal plasma" refers to a low energy ionized gas that is generated by electrical discharges between two electrodes. This technology, commercially referred to as CoronaLux(TM), is designed and intended for the "clean" destruction of hazardous chemical and biological waste (i.e., hospital "red bag" waste) thereby eliminating the need for costly segregation, transportation, incineration or landfill (with their associated legacy liabilities). PWS is a 54% owned subsidiary.  ReaCH4BioGas ("Reach") (trade name for Benefuels, LLC): (formed February 2013) owned 85% by SEER. Reach develops renewable natural gas projects that convert raw biogas into pipeline quality gas and/or Renewable, "RNG", for fleet vehicles. Reach has had minimal operations as of June 30, 2016.  SEER Environmental Materials, LLC ("SEM") formed September 2015. SEM is a wholly owned subsidiary established as a materials technology business with the purpose of developing advanced chemical absorbents and catalysts that enhance the capability of biogas produced from, landfill, wastewater treatment operations and agricultural digester operations.  Joint Ventures  MV RCM Joint Venture: In April 2013, MV Technologies, Inc ("MV") and RCM International, LLC ("RCM") entered into an Agreement to develop hybrid scrubber systems that employ elements of RCM Technology and MV Technology (the "Joint Venture"). RCM and MV Technologies will independently market the hybrid scrubber systems. The contractual Joint Venture has an initial term of five years and will automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless either Party gives the other Party one hundred and eighty (180) days' notice prior to the applicable renewal date. Operations to date of the Joint Venture have been limited to formation activities.  Paragon Waste (UK) Ltd: In June 2014, PWS and PCI Consulting Ltd ("PCI") formed Paragon Waste (UK) Ltd ("Paragon UK Joint Venture") to develop, permit and exploit the PWS waste destruction technology within the territory of Ireland and the United Kingdom. PWS and PCI each own 50% of the voting shares of Paragon UK Joint Venture. Operations to date of the Paragon UK Joint Venture have been limited to formation, the delivery of a CoronaLux(TM) unit with a third party in the United Kingdom and application and permitting efforts with regulatory entities.  P&P Company: In February 2015, PWS and Particle Science Tech of Environmental Protection, Inc. ("Particle Science") formed a joint venture, Particle &Paragon Environmental Solutions, Inc ("P&P") to exploit the PWS technology in China, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. PWS and Particle Science each own 50% of P&P. Operations to date have been limited to formation of P&P and the sale and delivery of a CoronaLux(TM) unit to Particle Science in China.  PWS MWS Joint Venture: In October 2014, PWS and Medical Waste Services, LLC ("MWS") formed a contractual joint venture to exploit the PWS medical waste destruction technology. In 2015, MWS licensed and installed a CoronaLux(TM) unit at an MWS facility, and subsequently received a limited permit to operate from the South Coast Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD") and the California Department of Public Health. Operations to date have included the destruction of medical waste while demonstrating the ultralow emissions necessary for application of a more expansive operating permit, submitted to SCAQMD in March 2016.  SEER's Financial Condition  As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $16.1 million $15.4 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 we had net loss before non-controlling interest of $805,900. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 our current liabilities exceed our current assets by approximately $2.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Our total assets exceed total liabilities at June 30, 2016 by approximately $1.5 and at December 31, 2015 our total assets exceeded our total liabilities by approximately $1 million. The Company raised $425,000 through the sale of common stock and exercise of common stock warrants for the period January 1, 2016 thru June 30, 2016. In Q1 2016, REGS, a wholly owned subsidiary, was notified that effective April 1, 2016 it would no longer be providing routine maintenance services to its largest customer but would still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services. The projected loss of revenue from this customer is estimated to be between $2.5 and $3 million annually. The Company opened an additional rail car cleaning facility in the Midwest (Illinois) in April 2016 to offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the refinery sector.  Realization of a major portion of our assets as of June 30, 2016, is dependent upon our continued operations. The Company is dependent on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. In addition, we have undertaken a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern. We continue to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies, diversifying our service customer and market concentrations and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing, aggressive cost management and overhead reductions. Critical to achieving profitability will be our ability to license and or sell, permit and operate though our joint ventures and licensees our CoronaLux(TM) waste destruction units. We have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding domestic markets attributable to increased federal and state emission control regulations (particularly in the nation's oil and gas fields) and a growing demand and a growing demand for energy conservation and renewable energies. In addition, the Company is evaluating various forms of financing that may be available to it. There can be no assurance that the Company will secure additional financing for working capital, increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years. These financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to report on a going concern basis.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  Total revenues were approximately $2.6 million and $3.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $417,700, or 14%, in revenues. Service segment revenues, which include industrial cleaning and railcar cleaning was approximately $1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $2.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $.6 million or 30%. While railcar cleaning revenues increased $221,100 or 31% comparing Q2 2016 to Q2 2015, industrial cleaning services revenues decreased $842,500 or 66% comparing 2016 to 2015. The primary reason for the decline in industrial cleaning revenue was the loss of routine maintenance services with our largest customer on April 1, 2016. In Q2 2015 this customer accounted for $1.25 million in industrial cleaning services revenue whereas in Q2 2016 this customer accounted for only $157,000. In April 2016 our industrial cleaning services segment commenced opening a railcar facility in Illinois and revenue generating operations commenced May 2016, generating revenues of $171,800 in Q2 2016 to partially offset the loss of industrial service revenues from our customer noted above. Our environmental solutions segment generated revenue of approximately $1.1 million in 2016 compared to $.9 million in 2015, an increase of $.2 million or 22%. The increase is primarily the result of increased media replacement sales comparing 2016 to 2015. Our solid waste segment generated $56,500 in revenue, mostly licensing fees, in Q2 2016 compared to $43,900 in Q2 2015 as a result of the delivery of three CoronaLux(TM) units in 2014. In addition, in Q2 2016 our solid waste disposal segment also generated $15,700 in income, representing our portion of the net income generated by the PWS-MWS joint venture operations in southern California where one of our CoronaLux(TM) units has been operating under the terms of a temporary permit issued by SCADMD since May 2015. The solid waste disposal segment receives non-refundable licensing fees which are being recognized as revenue ratably over the initial term of the agreements of between 5-7years.  Operating costs, which include cost of products, cost of services, solid waste costs, general and administrative (G&A) expenses and salaries and related expenses, were approximately $3.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 compared to $3.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in operating costs of approximately $.6 million is primarily the result of a 1) a 31% decrease in service revenues resulting in a corresponding decrease in service costs of $369,700, 2) a decrease in solid waste costs of $105,500 primarily attributable to a reduction in labor, travel, freight and other costs incurred in Q2 2015 related to the startup and commissioning costs of a Coronalux(TM) unit in Paramount, California that stopped once the unit commenced operations in May 2015. 3) a decrease in general and administrative cost of $126,300, comparing 2016 to 2015, primarily from a decrease in professional fees and research and development costs, 4) a decrease in salary related costs of $70,000, comparing 2016 to 2015, primarily attributable to a reduction is G&A salaries and wages due to a reduction in headcount, offset by, 5) an increase in product costs of $108,600 as a result of a 20% increase in product revenues. Service costs as a percentage of service revenues were essentially 100% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and 87% for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The increase in the percentage of service costs to service revenues is the result of the loss in industrial cleaning service revenues effective April 1, 2016 without a corresponding reduction in overhead. Resources previously allocated to servicing our significant customer were reallocated to the opening of the new rail facility in Illinois which started in April 2016. Product costs as a percentage of product revenues were fairly consistent at 62% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and 63% for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  Total non-operating other income (expense), net was $(137,800) for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 compared to $(19,100) for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. For the quarter ended June 30, 2016 non-operating expenses were comprised of interest expense of $(154,600) offset by other income of $16,900. For the quarter ended June 30, 2015 non-operating expenses of $(19,100) was comprised of interest expense of $22,000 offset by other income of $2,900. The increase in interest expense in Q2 2016 compared to Q2 2015 is due to, 1) the issuance of warrants, valued at $97,000, as an inducement to enter into a short term financing in Q2 2016 whereby the value of the warrants is considered additional interest costs and 2) in Q4 2015 and Q1 2016 we incurred additional convertible debt financing of $1.25 million which increased interest costs by approximately $25,000 per quarter. This additional interest cost was not incurred in Q2 2015.  There is no provision for income taxes for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 due to prior year losses and for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, due to our net loss for the period.  The Company had a net loss, before non-controlling interest, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 $852,800 compared to a net loss, before non-controlling interest, of $895,400 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The net loss attributable to SEER after deducting $56,900 for the non-controlling interest loss was $795,900 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 compared to net loss attributable to SEER of $744,000, after deducting $151,400 in non-controlling interest loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. As noted above while revenues declined $417,700 comparing Q2 2016 to Q2 2015, operating expenses also declined $563,300 comparing Q2 2016 to Q2 2015. The reduction in operating expenses was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as noted above of $132,600.  Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  Total revenues were approximately $6.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to approximately $6.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, a decline of $406,500 or 6%. Product revenues, comprising environmental solutions were approximately $1.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The slight reduction in environmental solutions revenue was due to some long term contracts that have been delayed but are now active. Bioactive media revenues from the environmental solutions segment increased from $268,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $586,000, and increase of $318,000. Services revenue includes industrial cleaning services and railcar cleaning services. Our railcar cleaning service revenues increased from approximately $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30 2015 to $1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $.4 million, or 27%. The increase in the number of railcars serviced is a result of the downturn in the oil and gas market and the railcar industry transition to transporting other liquid products thus increasing railcar service opportunities. Industrial cleaning services revenues declined approximately $800,000, or 23%, from $3.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $2.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The primary reason for the decline in industrial cleaning revenue was the loss of routine maintenance services with our largest customer effective April 1, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 this customer accounted for $1.9 million in revenues whereas for the six months ended June 30, 2015 this customer accounted for $2.6 million in industrial cleaning services revenue, a decrease of approximately $700,000. In April 2016 our industrial cleaning services segment commenced opening a railcar facility in Illinois and revenue generating operations commenced May 2016 generating revenues of $171,800 in Q2 2016 to partially offset the loss of industrial service revenues from our customer noted above. Our solid waste segment generated licensing and placement fees of $67,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $58,800 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as a result of the delivery of three CoronaLux(TM) units in 2014. In addition, in 2016 our solid waste disposal segment also generated $50,400 in revenue, representing billings to the PWS-MWS joint ventures for costs incurred on behalf of the joint venture and in 2016 our solid waste disposal segment also generated $15,700 in income, representing our portion of the net income generated by the PWS-MWS joint ventures operations in Paramount, California where one of our CoronaLux(TM) units has been operating under the terms of a temporary permit issued by SCADMD since May 2015. The solid waste disposal segment receives non-refundable licensing fees which are being recognized as revenue ratably over the initial term of the agreements of between 5-7 years.  Operating costs, which include cost of products, cost of services, solid waste costs, general and administrative (G&A) expenses and salaries and related expenses, were approximately $6.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $7.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in operating costs of approximately $1.2 is primarily the result of a 1) a decrease in product revenue (environmental solutions) of $125,100 or 7% resulting in a corresponding decrease in product costs of $189,200 or 15%, 2) a decrease in industrial and railcar cleaning services costs of $545,800 or 15% although revenue only decreased by 7%, 3) a decrease in solid waste costs of $129,900, 4) a decrease in general and administrative costs of $225,600, and 5) a decrease in salary and related costs of $103,300. Product costs as a percentage of product revenues were 63% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 69% for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in margin costs for the product sales is due to lower costs of chemical absorbents (media). Service costs as a percentage of service revenues were 72% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 79% for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in service costs is the result of higher manpower and equipment usage efficiency in Q1 2016. In Q1 2016 the industrial services segment was able to fully utilize manpower to where they were fully chargeable and based on the type of work we were able to utilize and bill our own equipment and rent less third party equipment resulting in service costs as a percentage of service revenues of 60%. As noted above, service costs as a percentage of service revenue was 100% in Q2 2016 because of the loss of industrial services revenue from a significant customer, effective April 1, 2016. In Q2, overhead costs in industrial services were not reduced relative to the reduction in industrial services revenue and resources previously allocated to servicing our significant customer were not fully utilized and were partially reallocated to the opening of a new rail facility in Illinois which started in April 2016. The month of April 2016 generated no revenue at the new rail facility as it took the entire month to get the site ready for use. Railcar cleaning services costs relative to revenues decreased from 84% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to 67% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. As a result of the significant increase in railcars available for servicing in 2016, manpower efficiency was significantly improved resulting in improved margins. Solid waste costs decrease from 2015 to 2016 by approximately $130,000. In 2015 startup and commissioning costs including, labor, travel, freight, supplies were incurred to get a Coronalux(TM) unit ready for use in Paramount California. Once operations commenced in May 2015, these costs were not incurred again so they did not repeat in 2016. In addition, the solid waste segment reduced its headcount to correspond with the level of activity thus also reducing costs in 2016. G&A expenses decreased $225,600 from approximately $1.28 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, to approximately $1.05 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The primary reasons for the decrease in G&A expense are; 1) a reduction in travel expenses of approximately $43,000, 2) a reduction in marketing of approximately $43,000, 3) a reduction of professional fees of approximately $97,000, 4) a reduction of direct R&D expenses of $83,000 offset by, 5) increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $12,000 and 6) increase in liability insurance of approximately $9,000. Salaries and related expenses were $1.37 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.48 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and decrease of $103,300 attributable to a reduction in engineering and officer salaries due to reduced headcount.  Total non-operating other income (expense), net was $(172,400) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $(36,600) for the six months ended June 30, 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 non-operating expenses were comprised of interest expense of $(202,300) offset by other income of 29,800. For the six months ended June 30, 2015 non-operating expenses of (36,600) was comprised of interest expense of $(39,500) offset by other income of $2,900. The increase in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to, 1) the issuance of warrants, valued at approximately $97,000, as an inducement to enter into a short term financing in Q2 2016 whereby the value of the warrants is considered additional interest costs and 2) in Q4 2015 and Q1 2016 we incurred additional convertible debt financing of $1.25 million which increased interest costs by approximately $25,000 per quarter. This additional interest cost was not incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2015 as this convertible debt financing was net yet outstanding.  There is no provision for income taxes for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 due to prior year losses and for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, due to our net loss for the period.  The Company had a net loss, before non-controlling interest, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $($806,000) compared to a net loss, before non-controlling interest, of $(1,472,700) for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net loss attributable to SEER after deducting $139,500 for the non-controlling interest loss was $(666,500) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to net loss attributable to SEER of $(1,199,900), after deducting $272,800 in non-controlling interest loss for the six months ended June 30, 2015. As noted above, revenues declined approximately 6% comparing the six months ended June 30, 2016 to the six months ended June 30, 2015. As noted above, virtually every category of operating expenses declined, with a total reduction of approximately $1.2 million from 2015 to 2016. As noted above interest expense increased as a result of the increase in interest bearing debt if Q42015 and Q1 2016.  Changes in Cash Flow  Operating Activities  The Company had net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $(56,500) compared to net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 of $654,300, a change of $710,800. Cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net loss and adjusted by non-cash items as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock based compensation expense and gain on extinguishment of debt. Non-cash adjustment totaled $461,200 and $424,700 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, so non-cash adjustments had essentially the same impact on net cash provided by operating activities. The net positive change in operating assets and liabilities was $157,600 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1,702,300. The primary drivers for net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016, despite a net loss of $(805,900), was a decrease in accounts receivable and cost in excess of billings on uncompleted projects of $262,800 offset by an increase in prepaid and other assets of $95,900. The decrease in accounts payable of $361,400 was offset by an increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncomplete projects. The primary drivers for net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015, despite a net loss of $(1,472,700), was an decrease in accounts receivable of $1,435,500 and an increase in deferred revenue of $376,500 which primarily represents payments from PWS licensees for which revenue has not yet been recognized, offset by a decrease of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $331,100.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our business and the results of our operations. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnotes and "Risk Factors" that appear elsewhere in this Report. Certain statements in this Report constitute "forward-looking statements." Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, among others, uncertainties relating to general economic and business conditions; industry trends; changes in demand for our products and services; uncertainties relating to customer plans and commitments and the timing of orders received from customers; announcements or changes in our pricing policies or that of our competitors; unanticipated delays in the development, market acceptance or installation of our products and services; changes in government regulations; availability of management and other key personnel; availability, terms and deployment of capital; relationships with third-party equipment suppliers; and worldwide political stability and economic growth. The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend" and "plan" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made. Unless the context requires otherwise, when we refer to "we," "us" and "our," we are describing SEER and its consolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  Overview  SEER was formed as a publicly traded company in early 2008 through a reverse merger. SEER is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental, clean-technology businesses that provide safe, innovative, cost effective, and profitable solutions in the oil & gas, environmental, waste management and renewable energy industries. SEER currently operates six companies with five offices in the western and mid-western U.S. Through these operating companies, SEER provides products and services throughout the U.S. and has licensed and owned technologies with many customer installations throughout the U.S. Each of the six operating companies is discussed in more detail below. The Company also has non-controlling interests in joint ventures, some of which have no or minimal operations  The Company's domestic strategy is to grow internally through SEER's subsidiaries that have well established revenue streams and, simultaneously, establish long-term alliances with and/or acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for renewable energy, waste and water treatment and oil & gas/industrial services. The focus of the SEER family of companies, however, is to increase margins by securing or developing proprietary, patented and patent-pending technologies, and then leveraging its 20 plus-year service experience to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets of emission capture and control, renewable "green gas" capture and sale, compressed natural gas fuel generation, as well as general solid waste and medical/pharmaceutical waste destruction. Many of SEER's current operating companies share customer bases and each provides truly synergistic services, technologies and products as well as annuity type revenue streams.  Financial Condition  At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $4.0 million in negative working capital, which represents a decrease of approximately $1.3 million from $2.7 million in negative working capital at December 31, 2015. The significant decrease in our working capital, results primarily from the net loss, before non-controlling interest, of $4.6 million for 2016. We were notified by a significant customer that effective April 1, 2016 we would no longer be providing routine maintenance services but still would be eligible to bid on other industrial cleaning services. The reduction of revenue from this customer during the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $2.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company opened additional rail car cleaning facilities in the Midwest (Illinois) and on the East Coast (Maryland) to offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the refinery sector.  In May 2013, REGS filed an Offer in Compromise with the IRS. REGS received a letter from the IRS, dated March 27, 2014, rejecting its Offer in Compromise and in accordance with the rejection letter REGS has submitted a written appeal. As a result of the IRS rejection of the Offer in Compromise, the Installment Plan, mentioned in Part 1, Item 1, was terminated. In June 2014, REGS received notices of intent to levy property or rights to property from the IRS for the amounts owed for the past due payroll taxes, penalty and interest. The appeal submitted by REGS was denied by the IRS, however, the IRS has not taken any current action. As of December 31, 2016 the outstanding balance due to the IRS was $993,300 and REGS continues to be represented by tax counsel specializing in federal tax matters.  As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has accumulated a deficit of approximately $19.2 million as of December 31, 2016, and $15.4 million as of December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, we incurred net losses of approximately $4.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively.  Realization of a major portion of our assets as of December 31, 2016, is dependent upon our continued operations. The Company is dependent on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. In addition, we have undertaken a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern. We continue to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing, aggressive cost management and overhead reductions. Critical to achieving profitability will be our ability to license and or sell, permit and operate though our joint ventures and licensees our CoronaLux(TM) waste destruction units. We have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding markets attributable to increased interest in energy conservation and emission control regulations. In addition, the Company is evaluating various forms of financing which may be available to it. There can be no assurance that the Company will secure additional financing for working capital, increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years. These financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to report on a going concern basis.  Results of Operations  Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015  Total revenues were $11.7 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of approximately $0.9 million or 7% in revenues comparing the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to the decreases in revenues from our industrial cleaning segment which decreased from approximately $5.3 million in 2015 to approximately $3.7 million in 2016, a decrease of $1.6 million or approximately 30% and was primarily attributable to a single customer. Our railcar cleaning segment revenues were $3.2 million for 2016 compared to $3 million for 2015, an increase of approximately $200,000, and the increase was attributable to an increase in the number of railcars serviced during that period. Our environmental solutions segment revenue increased from $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately 41%. The increase is primarily attributable to higher media replacement sales and higher long term contract revenues. Our solid waste disposal segment generated $780,500 in 2015 from the sale of 2 CoronaLux(TM) units, but did not generate any revenue from sales of CoronaLux(TM) units during 2016. The solid waste disposal segment also generated licensing and placement fees of $205,000 in 2016 and $110,000 in 2015, freight revenue of $90,000 in 2015 as a result of the delivery of CoronaLux(TM) units in 2015, but $0 in 2016. In addition, the solid waste disposal segment generated approximately $40,000 in other fees for 2016 compared to $60,000 in other fees for 2015. The solid waste disposal segment has received approximately $177,000 in non-refundable fees in 2016 and from inception through December 31, 2016, $815,000, which are being recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreements.  Operating expenses, which include cost of products, cost of services and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, fixed asset and other asset impairment and litigation settlement were approximately $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. 1) An increase of product cost of $1.0 million corresponds with the increase in product revenue by 41% over 2015, 2) a decrease in service costs of approximately $900,000 associated with a 16% decrease in service revenues of $1.3 million, 3) a decrease in SG&A of approximately $1.0 million comparing 2015 to 2016, this was a result of decrease of professional fees of $0.14 million, rent of $.07 million, marketing of $.07 million, salaries of $.20 million, share compensation of $0.22 million, subcontractors and fuel of $0.23 million, research and development of $0.28 million and an increase in insurance of $0.05 million and bad debts of $0.21 million, 4) a decrease in solid waste costs of approximately $1 million associated with a 77% decrease in solid waste revenues of $800,000. Service costs as a percentage of service revenues were 84% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 79% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in margin is due to a reduced utilization of equipment and manpower as a result of the significant reduction in service revenue. In 2016 we saw a significant decrease in equipment and manpower utilization as a result of a significant decrease in revenue in 2016. Product costs as a percentage of product revenues was 76% in 2016 compared to 72% in 2015. The change is not significant but is primarily due to recurring product sales that typically have lower margins than the normal one-time long term projects that have higher margins. Solid waste costs were $1.4 million in 2015 and $315,000 in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to two factors: 1) no sales of CoronaLux (TM) units in 2016 and 2) an increase in personnel to support the placement and operation of CoronaLux (TM) units with customer, along with product development and product enhancement activities. SG&A expense decreased from approximately $5.64 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to approximately $4.62 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $1 million. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to 1) a decrease of professional fees of $0.14 million, rent of $.07 million, marketing of $.07 million, salaries of $.20 million, share compensation of $0.22 million, subcontractors and fuel of $0.23 million, research and development of $0.28 million and an increase in insurance of $0.05 million and bad debts of $0.21 million. The slight decrease in salaries and wages in 2016 was due to a reduction on corporate support staff. We impaired, in 2016, our idle CoronaLux (TM) units in the amount of $809,000, our other long term asset related to Sterall in the amount of $720,000 (see Note 11) and accrued a litigation settlement in the amount of $277,000 including the related legal fees.  Total non-operating other income (expense), net was $(45,500) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $(328,000) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to i) an increase in interest expense of $234,000 as a result of an increase in convertible debt and short-term debt in 2016, ii) a decrease of $50,000 in gain in settlement of debt from 2015.  There is no provision for income taxes for both the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, due to our net losses for both periods.  Net loss, before non-controlling interest, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.6 million compared to a net loss, before non-controlling interest, of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss attributable to SEER after deducting $753,500 for the non-controlling interest was $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $2.8 million, after deducting $536,300 in non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2015. As noted above, the 7% decrease in revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 coupled with the other expenses incurred during 2016 was the primary reason for the increase in the net loss.  Changes in Cash Flow  Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $600,400 compared to $115,600 during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in operating activities is driven by our net loss and adjusted by non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation and amortization of property & equipment and intangible assets, stock based compensation expense and in 2016, asset impairment expense. In 2016, net non-cash adjustments totaled approximately $2.5 million and in 2015, net non-cash adjustments totaled $962,400. In 2016, the net effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in cash by approximately $2.2 million, primarily due to the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.4 million, an increase of $503,000 in billings in excess of revenue on uncompleted contracts, offset by an increase of $884,600 in accounts receivable and prepaid and other assets of $288,700. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the timing of invoicing on client contracts. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2016 was primarily increases in vendor payables due to the significant increase in environmental solutions revenue in 2016. In 2015, the net effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in cash by approximately $2.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.7 million and the decrease in fixed assets from the sale of 2 CoronaLux(TM) units for $780,500. In 2015, other changes in operating assets and liabilities offset each other resulting in no significant change in cash.  Investing activities  Net cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures. Our net cash used in investing activities was $149,800 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $854,200 for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2016 we had addition to property and equipment of $163,700, increases in intangible assets of $45,100 and received $59,000 of insurance proceeds.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $726,300 for 2016 and $783,900 for 2015. Proceeds from the sale of common stock and exercise and extension of warrants was $454,900 and $0 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Proceeds from the issuance of convertible and short-term debt was $1,155,000 and $1,250,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations was $424,100 in 2015 and $863,600 in 2016 and payments on related party notes payable was $42,000 in 2015 and $20,000 in 2016.  Overall, our cash changed very minimally from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to our net loss from operations offset by lower capital expenditures, sale of common stock and exercise and extension of warrants, and debt financing in 2016 that provided some working capital to offset our operating losses.  Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates  Use of Estimates  The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of intangible assets; valuation allowances and reserves for receivables, inventory and deferred income taxes; revenue recognition related to contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method; share-based compensation; and loss contingencies, including those related to litigation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk  Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable. We determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable, historical experience and management judgment. Accounts receivable balances are reviewed individually for collectability, and balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that the potential for recovery is remote. An allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $300,500 and $246,500 had been reserved as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We are exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business, primarily related to accounts receivable. Our customers operate primarily in the oil production and refining, rail transport, biogas generating and wastewater treatment industries in the United States. Accordingly, we are affected by the economic conditions in these industries as well as general economic conditions in the United States. To limit credit risk, management periodically reviews and evaluates the financial condition of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we do not believe that we have significant credit risk.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value due to their short-term maturities. We believe that the carrying value of notes payable with third parties, including their current portion, approximate their fair value, as those instruments carry market interest rates based on our current financial condition and liquidity. We believe the amounts due to related parties also approximate their fair value, as their carried interest rates are consistent with those of our notes payable with third parties.  Long-lived Assets  We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value. The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized an impairment to five CoronaLux (TM) units of $809,000. No impairment was determined as of December 31, 2015.  Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue related to contract projects and services when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Our revenue is primarily comprised of services related to industrial cleaning and railcar cleaning, which we recognize as services are rendered.  Product revenue generated from projects, which include the manufacturing of products, for removal and treatment of hazardous vapor and gasses is accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method for projects with durations in excess of three months and the completed-contract method for all other projects. Total estimated revenue includes all of the following: (1) the basic contract price (2) contract options and (3) change orders. Once contract performance is underway, we may experience changes in conditions, client requirements, specifications, designs, materials and expectations regarding the period of performance. Such changes are "change orders" and may be initiated by us or by our clients. In many cases, agreement with the client as to the terms of change orders is reached prior to work commencing; however, sometimes circumstances require that work progress without obtaining client agreement. Revenue related to change orders is recognized as costs are incurred if it is probable that costs will be recovered by changing the contract price. The Company does not incur pre-contract costs.Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize revenue primarily based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses are identified and included as additional loss. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts are shown separately as liabilities on the balance sheet, if significant, except in circumstances in which related costs are accumulated on the balance sheet, in which case the provisions are deducted from the accumulated costs. A provision as a liability is reported as a current liability.  For contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, we include in current assets and current liabilities amounts related to construction contracts realizable and payable. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent the excess of contract costs and profits recognized to date over billings to date, and are recognized as a current asset. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits recognized to date, and are recognized as a current liability.  The Company's revenues from waste destruction licensing agreements are recognized as a single accounting unit over the term of the license. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605, for revenues which contain multiple deliverables, the Company separates the deliverables into separate accounting units if they meet the following criteria: (i) the delivered items have a stand-alone value to the customer; (ii) the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined; and (iii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return, delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller. Deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables into one accounting unit. Revenue from each accounting unit is recognized based on the applicable accounting literature, primarily ASC 605.  The Company has five-year agreements with three companies in which the Company amortizes various fees on a straight-line basis over the initial five-year term of the agreement.  Stock-based Compensation  We account for stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant, and recognize compensation over the service period that they are expected to vest. We estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated value of the portion of a stock-based award that is ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures, such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised.  Recently issued accounting pronouncements  Changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standards updates (ASU's) to the FASB's Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all new or revised ASU's.  New Accounting Pronouncements Implemented  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance creating Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Section 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers". The new section will replace Section 605, "Revenue Recognition" and creates modifications to various other revenue accounting standards for specialized transactions and industries. The section is intended to conform revenue accounting principles with a concurrently issued International Financial Reporting Standards with previously differing treatment between United States practice and those of much of the rest of the world, as well as, to enhance disclosures related to disaggregated revenue information. The updated guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one year delay of the effective date. The Company will now adopt the new provisions of this accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2018.  In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period," ("ASU 2014-12"). Current U.S. GAAP does not contain explicit guidance on whether to treat a performance target that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition that affects vesting or as a nonvesting condition that affects the grant-date fair value of an award. The new guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The updated guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," ("ASU 2015-03"). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for the first interim period for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory." Under this ASU, inventory will be measured at the "lower of cost and net realizable value" and options that currently exist for "market value" will be eliminated. The ASU defines net realizable value as the "estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation."

	is, statements related to future, not past, events, including forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private
	Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the current expectations of the management of SEER and
	are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
	differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ
	materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to factors detailed in our reports filed with the U.S. Securities

	herein. In addition, these statements are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change. The forward-looking statements
	contained in the information in this Annual Report may include all other statements in this document other than historical facts.
	Without limitation, any statements preceded or followed by, or that include the words “targets”, “plans”,
	“believes”, “expects”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”,
	“anticipates”, “estimates”, “approximates”, “projects”, “seeks”, “sees”,
	“should,” “would,” “expect,” “positioned,” “strategy,” or words or
	terms of similar substance or derivative variation or the negative thereof, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
	include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, synergies, economic
	performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion
	and growth of SEER; (iii) the effects of government regulation on SEER’s business, and (iv) our plans, objectives, expectations
	and intentions generally.


	 


	There are a number
	of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
	statements. Additional particular uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed
	in forward-looking statements include: risks associated with our international operations; significant movements in foreign currency
	exchange rates; changes in the general economy, as well as the cyclical nature of our markets; availability and cost of raw materials,
	parts and components used in our products; the competitive environment in the areas of our planned industrial activities; our ability
	to identify, finance, acquire and successfully integrate attractive acquisition targets, expected earnings of SEER; the amount
	of and our ability to estimate known and unknown liabilities; material disruption at any of our significant manufacturing facilities;
	the solvency of our insurers and the likelihood of their payment for losses; our ability to manage and grow our business and execution
	of our business and growth strategies; our ability and the ability our customers to access required capital at a reasonable costs;
	our ability to expand our business in our targeted markets; the level of capital investment and expenditures by our customers in
	our strategic markets; our financial performance; our ability to identify, address and remediate any material weakness in our internal
	control over financial reporting; our ability to achieve or maintain credit ratings and the impact on our funding costs and competitive
	position if we do not do so; and other risk factors as disclosed herein under the caption “Risk Factors”. Other unknown
	or unpredictable factors could also cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statement.


	 


	Due to such uncertainties
	and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
	hereof. SEER undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
	future events or otherwise, except to the extent legally required. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a forecast, projection
	or estimate of the future financial performance of SEER unless otherwise expressly stated.

	ITEM 1. BUSINESS




	 



	Overview



	 


	Strategic Environmental
	& Energy Resources, Inc. (“the Company” or “SEER”) was originally organized under the laws of the State
	of Nevada on February 13, 2002 for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses, under the name of Satellite Organizing Solutions,
	Inc (“SOZG”). In January 2008, SOZG changed its name to Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc., reduced
	its number of outstanding shares through a reverse stock split and consummated the acquisition of both, REGS, LLC and Tactical
	Cleaning Company, LLC. SEER is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental, clean-technology businesses that
	provide safe, innovative, cost effective, and profitable solutions in the oil & gas, environmental, waste management and renewable
	energy industries. SEER currently operates six companies with five offices in the western and mid-western U.S. Through these operating
	companies, SEER provides products and services throughout the U.S. and has licensed technologies with many customer installations
	throughout the U.S. Each of the six operating companies is discussed in more detail below. The Company also has non-controlling
	interests in joint ventures, some of which have no or minimal operations.


	 


	The Company’s
	domestic strategy is to grow internally through SEER’s subsidiaries that have well established revenue streams and, simultaneously,
	establish long-term alliances with and/or acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for renewable energy,
	waste and water treatment and oil & gas services. The focus of the SEER family of companies, however is to increase margins
	by securing or developing proprietary patented and patent-pending technologies and then leveraging its 20 plus-year service experience
	to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets of emission capture and control, renewable “green gas”
	capture and sale, compressed natural gas (“CNG”) fuel generation, as well as general solid waste and medical/pharmaceutical
	waste destruction. Many of SEER’s current operating companies share customer bases and each provides truly synergistic services,
	technologies and products as well as annuity type revenue streams.


	 


	The company now owns
	and manages five operating entities and one entity that has no significant operations to date.

	PWS is an operating company that has developed a patented waste destruction technology
	using a pyrolytic heating process combined with “non-thermal plasma” assisted oxidation. This technique involves gasification
	of solid waste by heating the waste in a low-oxygen environment, followed by complete oxidation at higher temperatures in the presence
	of plasma. The term “non-thermal plasma” refers to a low energy ionized gas that is generated by electrical discharges
	between two electrodes. This technology, commercially referred to as CoronaLux™, is designed and intended for the “clean”
	destruction of hazardous chemical and biological waste

	(i.e

	., hospital “red bag” waste) thereby eliminating
	the need for costly segregation, transportation, incineration or landfill (with their associated legacy liabilities). PWS is a
	54% owned subsidiary.

	As of December 31,
	2016 and 2015, we had one customer with sales in excess of 10% of our revenue and they represented approximately 17% and 35%, of
	total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The loss of this customer, or a material reduction
	in revenue from this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and our working capital.
	In early 2016 we were notified by this significant customer that effective April 1, 2016 we would no longer be providing routine
	maintenance services but still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services. During 2016, the loss of revenue from
	this customer was approximately $2.5 million. See Notes 2 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 1A Risk Factors.


	 



	Financial Condition



	 


	As shown in the accompanying
	consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has an accumulated deficit of approximately
	$19.3 million as of December 31, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, we incurred net losses, before non-controlling
	interest, of approximately $4.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 our current liabilities
	exceed our current assets by approximately $4.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Our total liabilities exceed total assets
	at December 31, 2016 by approximately $2.3 million and at December 31, 2015 our total assets exceeded our total liabilities by
	approximately $1.0 million. The primary reason for the increase in negative working capital and the reduction in total assets
	over total liabilities from 2015 to 2016 is due to the impairment of Paragon CoronaLux™ waste destruction units, the impairment
	of a long term asset, litigation settlement costs, and the net loss incurred in 2016 as noted above. Also see Notes 2 and 11 to
	the consolidated financial statements. In early 2016 REGS, a wholly owned subsidiary, was notified that effective April 1, 2016
	it would no longer be providing routine maintenance services to its largest customer but would still be eligible to provide other
	industrial cleaning services. The loss of revenue from this customer was approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December
	31, 2016. The Company opened an additional rail car cleaning facility in the Midwest (Illinois) and East Coast (Maryland) to offset
	some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the refinery sector.


	 


	Realization of a major
	portion of our assets as of December 31, 2016, is dependent upon our continued operations. The Company is dependent on generating
	additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. In addition, we have undertaken
	a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern. We continue to focus on developing organic growth in our
	operating companies, diversifying our service customer and market concentrations and improving gross and net margins through increased
	attention to pricing, aggressive cost management and overhead reductions. Critical to achieving profitability will be our ability
	to license and or sell, permit and operate through our joint ventures and licensees our CoronaLux™ waste destruction units.
	We have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding domestic markets attributable
	to increased federal and state emission control regulations (particularly in the nation’s oil and gas fields) and a growing
	demand for energy conservation and renewable energies. In addition, the Company is evaluating various forms of financing that may
	be available to it. There can be no assurance that the Company will secure additional financing for working capital, increase revenues
	and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years. These financial statements
	do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to report on a going concern basis.

	Industry



	 


	SEER, with its diverse
	services, technologies, and environmental solution offerings, participates in the worldwide markets of industrial cleaning, environmental
	compliance, renewable energy and waste minimization/management. There are ever-increasing emissions and solid waste regulations
	and statutory programs at the local, state, federal and international levels that create and mandate the need for renewable energies
	and waste minimization, proper handling, storage, treatment and disposal of virtually all types of waste.


	 


	The industrial waste
	management industry in North America was shaped first by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”),
	which requires waste generators to, among other things, store and dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with specific regulations.
	Subsequent to RCRA, growing national awareness of environmental issues, coupled with corporate and institutional awareness of environmental
	liabilities, have contributed to the growth of the industry and associated governing legislation on the state and federal levels.


	 


	Today, collection
	and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes are subject to local, state, and federal requirements and controls that regulate health,
	safety, the environment, zoning and land-use. Included in these regulations is the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
	and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), of the United States. CERCLA holds generators and transporters of hazardous substances,
	as well as past and present owners and operators of sites where there has been a hazardous release, strictly, jointly and severally
	liable for environmental cleanup costs resulting from the release or threatened release of hazardous materials.


	 


	The enactment of the
	federal

	Clean Air Act of 1970

	(CAA) resulted in a major shift in the federal government’s role in air pollution control.
	This legislation authorized the development of comprehensive federal and state regulations to limit emissions from both stationary
	(industrial) sources and mobile sources. The Act has been amended and expanded in scope many times since its enactment and remains
	a major consideration for safely and responsibly conducting business in the U.S.


	 


	These and countless
	other similar regulatory programs mandate the need for environmental and industrial cleaning services and technologies such as
	those offered by SEER and its companies.


	 


	There are substantial
	barriers to entry in the waste management industry, including the high degree of expertise and training required, regulatory compliance,
	insurance, and licensing costs and procedures, strict federal, state, provincial and local permitting and oversight processes,
	and significant capital costs of equipment and qualified personnel.


	 



	Business Strategy



	 


	SEER’s growth
	to date has been fueled by a combination of synergistic and vertical integration, acquisitions, strategic alliances and organic
	growth. SEER acquired REGS, Tactical, and MV as wholly-owned subsidiaries. In 2015 SEM was created to provide recurring and high-margin
	revenue to the Company by offering an internal source of diverse media solutions that are required for the treatment of various
	waste and off gas streams. This also enables greater pricing flexibility by the technology solutions affiliates that, in turn,
	should result in increased sales of systems that leads to greater demand of media. The increased installation and demand for media
	change outs also creates service opportunities for the Company’s service sector. We intend to continue pursuing an aggressive
	strategy of both acquisitions and organic growth while expanding our geographic footprint into other regions of the United States
	and foreign markets. Potential acquisitions may include businesses that secure supply chain and vendor logistics or are complementary
	to our core businesses or companies that provide a similar set of services in regions where the Company does not currently have
	operations.


	 


	Upon full development
	of certain of our patented and patent-pending technologies, we intend to explore licensing relationships with larger, established
	companies to generate sustainable revenue streams from both domestic and international applications.

	Intellectual Property



	 


	MV was issued a patent
	in 2012 related to “Oil-Gas Vapor Collection, Storage, and Recovery System, etc.” Patent No. US 8,206,124 B1. MV was
	issued a second patent in 2014 titled “Fugitive Gas Capture”, US Patent No. 8,708,663 B1, that expanded claims in the
	earlier patent. The patents will expire in 2029 and 2031, respectively, unless otherwise extended. MV is in the process of expanding
	the scope and number of claims of this issued patent.


	 


	In 2013, PWS filed
	provisional and non-provisional patent applications in the name and for the benefit of SEER arising out of and related to its waste
	disposal technology involving a pyrolitic first phase and a “cold plasma” second phase system referred to as “plasma
	light,” or CoronaLux™ technology. In October 2014 SEER was issued patent No. 8,870,735 for this CoronaLux™ technology.
	In 2014, PWS filed a provisional patent related to destruction of volatile organic compounds. A pyrolytic process is basically
	the decomposition of any material at elevated temperatures in a very low oxygen-containing atmosphere, as compared to conventional
	incineration or pyrolysis processes. In July 2016 SEER was issued patent No. 9,393,519 for this CoronaLux™ technology. The
	patents will expire in 2033.


	 



	Competition



	 


	The industrial services
	industry is highly competitive. Our competitors vary in size, geographical coverage and by the mix of services they offer. Our
	larger competitors include Philip Services, Clean Harbors, and Veolia Environmental Services. Additionally, we compete with a number
	of small and medium size companies. In the face of this competition we have been effective in growing our revenue due to the wide
	range of services we offer, a competitive pricing structure, our innovative and proprietary/patent pending technologies, and a
	reputation for reliability, built over the nearly 20 years of business operations as well as the care we take in performing and
	completing each customer project.


	 


	In all its businesses,
	the Company currently holds very small parts of very large and growing markets. MV competes by providing superior hydrogen sulfide
	(“H

	2

	S”) “scrubbing” solutions that result in more cost effective removal of H

	2

	S from
	process gas streams. H

	2

	S is highly corrosive, and is a precursor to sulfur dioxide, a highly regulated air pollutant.
	Therefore removing H

	2

	S from industrial process waste streams is important in order to enhance the safety of personnel,
	extend the life of industrial equipment, and to minimize resulting air pollution. In the markets served by MV there are a number
	of competing technologies employed such as: biological scrubbing, chemical scrubbing, and dry scrubbing with activated carbon.
	REGS and Tactical Cleaning Company compete by offering superior customer response and lower total cost of service. PWS plans to
	compete by offering a unique on-site, on-demand waste destruction solution, eliminating the need for waste segregation, transportation,
	incineration, autoclaving and/or landfilling; in turn, eliminating all of the associated costs and legacy liabilities associated
	with current options for medical waste handling. We believe that the patented CoronaLux™ technology results in a radically
	superior option in the medical waste management sector and in ultimate emissions cleaner than other solutions available in the
	market.


	 



	Environmental Matters and Regulation



	 


	Significant federal
	environmental laws affecting us are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Comprehensive Environmental
	Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund Act”, the Clean Air Act,
	the Clean Water Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”).


	 



	RCRA.

	RCRA
	is the principal federal statute governing hazardous waste generation, treatment, transportation, storage and disposal. Pursuant
	to RCRA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has established a comprehensive “cradle-to-grave”
	system for the management of a wide range of materials identified as hazardous or solid waste. States that have adopted hazardous
	waste management programs with standards at least as stringent as those promulgated by the EPA have been delegated authority by
	the EPA to administer their facility permitting programs in lieu of the EPA’s program. Every facility that treats, stores or disposes
	of hazardous waste must obtain a RCRA permit from the EPA or an authorized state agency, unless a specific exemption exists, and
	must comply with certain operating requirements

	.



	 




	 

	8





	 



	 




	The
	Superfund Act.


	The Superfund Act is the primary federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance
	sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. It also provides for immediate response and removal actions
	coordinated by the EPA, of the release of hazardous substances into the environment, and authorizes the government to respond to
	the release or threatened release of hazardous substances or to order responsible persons to perform any necessary cleanup. The
	statute provides for strict, and in certain cases, joint and several liability for these responses and other related costs, and
	for liability for the cost of damages to natural resources, to the parties involved in the generation, transportation and disposal
	of such hazardous substances. Under the statute, we may be deemed liable as a generator or transporter of a hazardous substance
	which is released into the environment, or as the owner or operator of a facility from which there is a release of a hazardous
	substance into the environment.


	 




	The
	Clean Air Act.


	The Clean Air Act was passed by Congress to control the emissions of pollutants into the air and requires
	permits to be obtained for certain sources of toxic air pollutants such as vinyl chloride, or criteria pollutants, such as carbon
	monoxide. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to require further reductions of air pollutants with specific targets for
	non-attainment areas in order to meet certain ambient air quality standards. These amendments also require the EPA to promulgate
	regulations, which (i) control emissions of 189 hazardous air pollutants; (ii) create uniform operating permits for major industrial
	facilities similar to RCRA operating permits; (iii) mandate the phase-out of ozone depleting chemicals; and (iv) provide for enhanced
	enforcement.


	 




	Clean
	Water Act.


	This legislation prohibits discharges into the waters of the United States without governmental authorization
	and regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers from a variety of sources, including disposal sites and
	treatment facilities

	.



	 




	Toxic
	Substances Control Act.


	TSCA established a national program for the management of substances classified as PCBs, which
	include waste PCBs as well as RCRA wastes contaminated with PCBs. We conduct field services (remediation) activities that are regulated
	under provisions of the TSCA.


	 




	Other
	Federal Laws.


	In addition to regulations specifically directed at the transportation, storage, and disposal facilities,
	there are a number of regulations that may “pass-through” to the facilities based on the acceptance of regulated waste
	from affected client facilities. Each facility that accepts affected waste must comply with the regulations for that waste, facility
	or industry. In our transportation operations, we are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad
	Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as by the regulatory agencies of each state
	in which we operate or through which our vehicles pass. Health and safety standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act,
	or “OSHA”, are applicable to all of our operations.


	 


	Pursuant to the EPA’s
	authorization of their RCRA equivalent programs, a number of states have regulatory programs governing the permitting and operation
	of hazardous waste facilities. Our facilities are regulated pursuant to state statutes, including those addressing clean water
	and clean air. Our facilities are also subject to local siting, zoning and land use restrictions. Although our facilities occasionally
	have been cited for regulatory violations, we believe we are in substantial compliance with all federal, state and local laws regulating
	our business

	.



	 



	Income/Payroll Taxes



	 


	In 2009 and 2010,
	REGS, a subsidiary of the Company, became delinquent for unpaid federal employer and employee payroll taxes and accrued interest
	and penalties related to the unpaid payroll taxes.


	 


	In or around 2010,
	REGS retained Washington D.C.-based legal counsel specializing in resolving federal tax matters. REGS has been represented by this
	firm throughout all phases of this tax matter and related proceedings. In September 2011, REGS received approval from the Internal
	Revenue Service (“IRS”) to begin paying the outstanding federal payroll tax liability plus related interest and penalties
	totaling approximately $971,000, in installments (the “Installment Plan”). Under the Installment Plan, we were required
	to pay minimum monthly installments of $12,500 commencing September 2011, which increased to $25,000 per month in September 2012,
	until the liability was paid in full. Through the duration of the Installment Plan, the IRS continued to charge penalties and interest
	at statutory rates. If the conditions of the Installment Plan were not met, the IRS could cancel it and could demand the outstanding
	liability to be repaid through traditional enforcement proceedings available to the IRS. Additionally, the IRS has filed a notice
	of federal tax lien against certain of REGS assets in order to secure the obligation. The IRS is to release this lien if and when
	we pay the full amount due. Two of the officers of REGS also have liability exposure for a portion of the taxes if REGS does not
	pay them.


	 




	 

	9





	 



	 


	In May 2013, REGS
	filed an Offer in Compromise (“OIC”) with the IRS. While the OIC was under review by the IRS, the requirement to pay
	$25,000 a month under the Installment Plan was suspended. REGS was informed by its legal counsel that the IRS had accepted REGS’
	OIC. However by a letter dated March 27, 2014 REGS was notified that the OIC had been rejected. REGS appealed that rejection decision.
	However that appeal has been denied. As a result, the Installment Plan is terminated. In June 2014, REGS received notices of intent
	to levy property or rights to property from the IRS for the amounts owed for the past due payroll taxes, penalty and interest.
	The IRS has not taken any current action against REGS and REGS continues to be represented by its legal counsel.


	 


	As of December 31,
	2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance due to the IRS was $993,300, and $970,500, respectively.


	 


	Other than this outstanding
	payroll tax matter arising in 2009 and 2010, all state and federal taxes have been paid by REGS in a timely manner.


	 



	Insurance



	 


	To cover potential
	risks associated with the variety of services that the operating companies provide, we maintain adequate insurance coverages, including:
	1) Casualty Insurance providing coverage for Commercial General Liability, Automotive Liability, Professional Liability Insurance
	and Employee Benefits Liability in the amounts of $1 million each, respectively, per year; 2) Contractor’s Pollution Liability
	Insurance, which has limits of $1 million per occurrence and $1 million in the aggregate; 3) Transportation Liability Insurance
	with a $1 million per occurrence; and 4) An Excess Umbrella Liability Policy of $5 million per occurrence and $5 million aggregate
	limit overall.


	 



	Health, Safety and Compliance



	 


	Preserving the health
	and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate, as well as remaining in compliance with local, state and federal
	rules and regulations are the highest priorities for us and our companies. We strive to maintain the highest professional standards
	in our compliance and health and safety activities. To achieve this objective, we have an in-house, full-time, health & safety
	officer and emphasize comprehensive training programs for new employees as well as ongoing mandatory refresher programs, and safety
	bonus programs for existing employees. These programs are administered at both the corporate and field levels on a daily basis.
	Our efforts to ensure the health and safety of employees have been formally recognized by our customers as well as by the Colorado
	Department of Labor and Employment.


	 



	Research and Development



	 


	Research and Development
	(“R&D”) costs are charged to operations when incurred and are included in operating expenses. R&D expenses
	consist primarily of salaries, project materials, contract labor and other costs associated with ongoing product development and
	enhancement efforts. We spent approximately $192,500 and $491,200 on R&D for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 



	Employees



	 


	As of December 31,
	2016, we employed approximately 70 full time non-union hourly and salaried employees. There is some seasonality to our business
	which requires us to use day laborers.

	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS




	 


	An investment in our
	securities involves certain risk factors, including those described below. Investors should carefully consider these risk factors
	along with information included or referred to in this report as well as other SEC filings before investing in our securities.


	 



	Risks Relating to Our Business



	 




	Our business and results of operations
	would be adversely affected if we are unable to secure reasonably priced insurance that is required for our operations.




	 


	Because our business
	sometimes involves the handling and disposal of hazardous materials, we are required to maintain insurance coverage that can be
	expensive. Our ability to continue conducting business could be adversely affected if we should become unable to secure sufficient
	insurance coverage, surety bonds and financial assurances at reasonable cost to meet our business and regulatory requirements.
	The availability of insurance could be affected by factors outside of our control as well as the insurers’ or sureties’ assessment
	of our risk.


	 




	The environmental services industry
	in which we participate is subject to significant economic and business risks.




	 


	Our future operating
	results may be affected by such factors as our ability to win new business and remain competitive in the face of price competition
	from competitors who are often larger and better capitalized than us; maintain and/or build market share in an industry that has
	experienced downsizing and consolidation; reduce costs without negatively impacting operations; minimize downtime and disruptions
	of operations; weather economic downturns or recessionary conditions.


	 




	A significant portion of our business
	is derived as a result of events and circumstances over which we have no control.




	 


	Certain services that
	we provide are impacted by events such as accidental spills of hazardous materials, increasingly stringent environmental regulations
	governing hazardous waste handling, and seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers’
	spending for remedial activities. Many of our customers are affected by the price of crude oil and refined products primarily because
	these customers do not produce crude oil but must purchase crude oil in the market. The fluctuating price of crude oil can have
	a significant impact on their operating margins. Unfavorable or volatile trends in fossil fuel prices (oil, diesel, natural gas)
	may result in decreased demand for the company’s services. We do not control such factors and, as a result, our revenue and income
	can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. Prior financial performance for certain periods may not be
	a reliable indicator of future performance for comparable periods in subsequent years.


	 




	Seasonality makes it harder for us
	to manage our business and for investors to evaluate our performance.




	 


	Our operations may
	be affected by seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers’ needs for remedial
	and other services that we provide. This seasonality in our business makes it harder for us to manage our business and for investors
	to evaluate our performance.


	 




	Our common stock is thinly traded,
	the prices at which it trades are volatile and the buying or selling actions of a few shareholders may adversely affect our stock
	price.




	 


	As of December 31,
	2016, we had a public float, which is defined as shares outstanding minus shares held by our officers, directors, or beneficial
	holders of greater than 10% of our outstanding common stock and restricted common stock, of 45,873,448 shares, or 84% of our outstanding
	common stock. The average number of shares traded in any given day over the past year (approximately 29,000) has been relatively
	small compared to the public float. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we traded a total of 7,277,428 shares or 15% of our public
	float. Thus, the actions of a few shareholders either buying or selling shares of our common stock may adversely affect the price
	of the shares. Historically, securities similar to our common stock have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that
	do not necessarily relate to operating performance.


	 




	 

	11





	 



	 




	Because our quarterly and annual
	operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate, the market price for our stock may be volatile.




	 


	Our operating results
	have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Fluctuations in operating
	results may result in volatility of the price of our common stock. These quarterly and annual fluctuations may result from a number
	of factors, including the size of new contracts and when we are able to recognize the related revenue; our rate of progress under
	our contracts; the timing of customer and market acceptance of our products and service offerings; budgeting cycles of our customers;
	the mix of products and services sold; changes in demand for our products and services; level and timing of expenses for product
	development and sales, general and administrative expenses; competition; changes in our strategy; general economic conditions.


	 


	Personnel costs are
	a significant component of our budgeted expense levels and, therefore, our expenses are, to a degree, variable based upon our expectations
	regarding future revenue. Our revenue is difficult to forecast because the market for our products and services is rapidly changing,
	and our sales cycle and the size and timing of significant contracts varies substantially among customers. Accordingly, we may
	be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenue. Any significant shortfall
	from anticipated levels of demand for our products and services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results
	of operations and cash flows.


	 


	Based on these factors,
	we believe our future quarterly and annual operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. As
	a result, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful nor do they indicate
	what our future performance will be. Furthermore, we believe that in future reporting periods if our operating results fall below
	the expectations of public market analysts or investors, it is possible that the market price of our common stock could go down.


	 




	Our results of operations could be
	negatively impacted if we are unable to manage our liquidity.




	 


	Our ability to meet
	our obligations as they come due could be negatively impacted if we are unable to invoice and collect from our customers in a
	timely manner, if our revenue levels fall below forecast, or expenses exceed what we projected, or an unexpected adverse event,
	or combination of events occurs. Therefore, if the timing of cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity
	requirements, we may require access to additional funds to support our business objectives through debt restructuring, a credit
	facility or possibly the issuance of additional equity. Additional financing may not be available at all or, if available, may
	not be obtainable on terms that are favorable to us and not dilutive. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements,
	the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $19.2 million as of December 31,
	2016. For the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, we incurred net losses, before non-controlling interest, of approximately
	$4.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 our current liabilities exceed our current assets by approximately
	$4.0 million.


	 




	Our independent registered public
	accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.




	 


	Our financial statements
	as of December 31, 2016 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months.
	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our need
	to obtain additional financing and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue
	as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity financing or other capital, attain further operating
	efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue.


	 




	 

	12





	 



	 


	The financial statements
	do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We are continually evaluating opportunities
	to raise additional funds through public or private equity financings, as well as evaluating prospective business partners, and
	will continue to do so. However, if adequate funds are not available to us when we need it, and we are unable to enter into some
	form of strategic relationship that will give us access to additional cash resources, we will be required to even further curtail
	our operations which would, in turn, further raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.


	 




	We depend on a limited number of
	significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely
	affect our business.




	 


	We earn a significant
	portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers. The loss of any significant customer or a material reduction
	in revenues from the sale of product or services, delays in delivery or acceptance of any of our products by a customer, delays
	in the performance of services for a customer, or delays in collection of customer receivables could have a negative impact on
	our business and operating results. Effective April 1, 2016 we were notified that we would no longer be providing routine maintenance
	services to our largest customer but would still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services. The loss of revenue
	from this customer in 2016 was approximately $2.5 million. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.


	 




	Our business depends largely on our
	ability to attract and retain talented employees.




	 


	Our ability to manage
	future expansion, if any, effectively will require us to attract, train, motivate and manage new employees successfully, to integrate
	new management and employees into our overall operations and to continue to improve our operations, financial and management systems.
	We may not be able to retain personnel or to hire additional personnel on a timely basis, if at all. Because of the complexity
	and training required in certain of our services, a significant time lag exists between the hiring date of technical and sales
	personnel and the time when they become fully productive. Our failure to retain personnel or to hire qualified personnel on a timely
	basis could adversely affect our business by impacting our ability to service certain customers and to secure new contracts.


	 




	We are subject to extensive environmental
	regulations that may increase our costs and potential liabilities.




	 


	The operations of
	all companies in the environmental services industry are subject to federal, state, provincial and local environmental requirements.
	Although increasing environmental regulation often presents new business opportunities for us, it also results in increased operating
	and compliance costs. Efforts to conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including environmental
	rules and regulations, require programs to promote compliance, such as training employees and customers, purchasing health and
	safety equipment, and in some cases hiring outside consultants. Even with these programs, we and other companies in the environmental
	services industry are faced with governmental enforcement proceedings, which can result in fines or other sanctions and require
	expenditures for remedial work on waste management facilities and contaminated sites. Certain of these laws impose strict and,
	under certain circumstances, joint and several liability for cleanup of releases of regulated materials, and also liability for
	related natural resource damages.


	 


	At some time in the
	future we may be required to pay fines or penalties due to regulatory enforcement proceedings and such fines or penalties could
	have a negative impact on our earnings. Additionally, regulatory authorities have the power to suspend or revoke permits or licenses
	needed for our operations, which may affect our customers’ willingness to do business with us and/or out ability to conduct
	business. This, in turn, would impact our revenue and profitability. To date, we have never had any of our operating permits revoked,
	suspended or non-renewed involuntarily, although it is possible that could occur in the future.


	 




	Changes in environmental regulations
	or entry into related businesses may require us to make significant capital expenditures.




	 


	Changes in environmental
	regulations or our entry into new businesses could require us to make significant capital expenditures. Periodically, the government
	revises rules and regulations regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous waste that requires us and other companies in the
	environmental services industry to invest in new equipment, training or other areas in order to remain in compliance. Additionally,
	because we intend to expand our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses, we anticipate the need to raise additional
	capital to support these acquisitions. Future environmental regulations and acquisitions could cause us to make significant additional
	capital expenditures and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.


	 




	 

	13





	 



	 




	If our internal growth objectives
	prove to be inaccurate, our results of operations could be adversely affected.




	 


	While we believe that
	increasing environmental regulations and our growing product and services portfolio provide us with ample growth opportunities,
	it is possible that we will not be able to achieve our internal growth objectives due to causes such as a lack of growth capital,
	intense competition, regulatory issues, loss of permits and licenses, and other factors. Likewise, while we also intend to grow
	through acquisition, it is possible that we will be unable to grow this way due to lack of adequate financing, lack of viable acquisition
	candidates, competition for possible acquisitions and other factors. To the extent that our growth objectives prove to be significantly
	different than actual results, our results of operations could be adversely affected.


	 




	Disruptions from terrorist activities
	or military actions may have an adverse effect on our business.




	 


	The continued threat
	of terrorism within the U.S. and acts of war may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world. Our business and
	results of operations could be materially and adversely affected to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations
	of customer orders, delays in collecting cash, a general decrease in corporate spending, or our inability to effectively market,
	manufacture or ship our products. We are unable to predict whether war and the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will
	result in any long-term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have any long-term material adverse effect
	on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.


	 




	We do business in a highly competitive
	industry and compete with companies that have substantially more resources that we do.




	 


	The industrial services
	industry is highly competitive. Several of the companies with which we compete are larger, offer more services and products, have
	better access to growth capital, have larger sales and marketing departments and larger workforces and other advantages that may
	make it difficult for us to win new business when in competition with them.


	 




	We have not paid and do not expect
	in the foreseeable future to pay dividends on our common stock.




	 


	We have not paid and
	do not anticipate paying for the foreseeable future any dividends on our common stock. We intend to reinvest future earnings, if
	any, into the operation and expansion of our business and payment of our outstanding debt.


	 




	Certain directors and officers own
	substantial amounts of our common stock and, as a group, will have the ability to exercise substantial influence over matters submitted
	to our stockholders for approval.




	 


	As of December 31,
	2016, J John Combs III, President, CEO and Director of SEER and Michael J. Cardillo, Founder and President of our REGS subsidiary,
	and Fortunato Villamagna, president of our PWS subsidiary, beneficially held approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock.
	The beneficial ownership of all Officers and Directors at December 31, 2016 was 16%. As a result, our directors and officers may
	be able to exercise substantial influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors,
	any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transactions. These
	stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders.
	The significant concentration of stock ownership might cause the trading price of our common stock to decline if investors were
	to perceive that conflicts of interest may exist or arise over any such potential transactions. Potential future sales of common
	stock by our directors and executive officers, and our other principal stockholders, may cause our stock price to fall.


	 




	 

	14





	 



	 




	We depend on certain key personnel



	.



	 


	We are highly dependent
	on a limited number of key management personnel, particularly our President and CEO, J. John Combs III, Fortunato Villamagna,
	President of our subsidiary, PWS, Mike Cardillo, President of our subsidiary, REGS and Richard Robertson, COO of SEER and President
	of our subsidiary, MV Technologies. Our loss of key personnel to death, disability or termination, or our inability to hire and
	retain qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.


	 




	General risk statement


	.


	 


	Based on all of the
	foregoing, we believe it is possible for future revenue, expenses and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter
	and year to year. As a result, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful
	or indicative of future performance. Furthermore, we believe that it is possible that in any given quarter or fiscal year our operating
	results could differ from the expectations of public market analysts or investors. In such event or in the event that adverse conditions
	prevail, or are perceived to prevail, with respect to our business or generally, the market price of our common stock would likely
	decline.

	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations




	 


	The following discussion
	is intended to assist in understanding our business and the results of our operations. It should be read in conjunction with the
	Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnotes and “Risk Factors” that appear elsewhere in this Report.
	Certain statements in this Report constitute “forward-looking statements.”  Such forward-looking statements involve
	known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
	different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Factors
	that might cause such a difference include, among others, uncertainties relating to general economic and business conditions; industry
	trends; changes in demand for our products and services; uncertainties relating to customer plans and commitments and the timing
	of orders received from customers; announcements or changes in our pricing policies or that of our competitors; unanticipated delays
	in the development, market acceptance or installation of our products and services; changes in government regulations; availability
	of management and other key personnel; availability, terms and deployment of capital; relationships with third-party equipment
	suppliers; and worldwide political stability and economic growth.  The words “believe,” “expect,”
	“anticipate,” “intend” and “plan” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.
	 Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the
	statement was made. Unless the context requires otherwise, when we refer to “we,” “us” and “our,”
	we are describing SEER and its consolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.


	 



	Overview



	 


	SEER was formed as
	a publicly traded company in early 2008 through a reverse merger. SEER is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental,
	clean-technology businesses that provide safe, innovative, cost effective, and profitable solutions in the oil & gas, environmental,
	waste management and renewable energy industries. SEER currently operates six companies with five offices in the western and mid-western
	U.S. Through these operating companies, SEER provides products and services throughout the U.S. and has licensed and owned technologies
	with many customer installations throughout the U.S. Each of the six operating companies is discussed in more detail below. The
	Company also has non-controlling interests in joint ventures, some of which have no or minimal operations


	 


	The Company’s
	domestic strategy is to grow internally through SEER’s subsidiaries that have well established revenue streams and, simultaneously,
	establish long-term alliances with and/or acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for renewable energy,
	waste and water treatment and oil & gas/industrial services. The focus of the SEER family of companies, however, is to increase
	margins by securing or developing proprietary, patented and patent-pending technologies, and then leveraging its 20 plus-year service
	experience to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets of emission capture and control, renewable “green
	gas” capture and sale, compressed natural gas fuel generation, as well as general solid waste and medical/pharmaceutical
	waste destruction. Many of SEER’s current operating companies share customer bases and each provides truly synergistic services,
	technologies and products as well as annuity type revenue streams.


	 



	Financial Condition



	 



	At
	December 31, 2016, we had approximately $4.0 million in negative working capital, which represents a decrease of approximately
	$1.3 million from $2.7 million in negative working capital at December 31, 2015. The significant decrease in our working capital,
	results primarily from the net loss, before non-controlling interest, of $4.6 million for 2016. We were notified by a significant
	customer that effective April 1, 2016 we would no longer be providing routine maintenance services but still would be eligible
	to bid on other industrial cleaning services. The reduction of revenue from this customer during the year ended December 31, 2016
	was approximately $2.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company opened additional rail car cleaning facilities
	in the Midwest (Illinois) and on the East Coast (Maryland) to offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from
	the refinery sector.

	In May 2013,
	REGS filed an Offer in Compromise with the IRS. REGS received a letter from the IRS, dated March 27, 2014, rejecting its
	Offer in Compromise and in accordance with the rejection letter REGS has submitted a written appeal. As a result of the IRS
	rejection of the Offer in Compromise, the Installment Plan, mentioned in Part 1, Item 1, was terminated. In June 2014, REGS
	received notices of intent to levy property or rights to property from the IRS for the amounts owed for the past due payroll
	taxes, penalty and interest. The appeal submitted by REGS was denied by the IRS, however, the IRS has not taken any current
	action. As of December 31, 2016 the outstanding balance due to the IRS was $993,300 and REGS continues to be represented by
	tax counsel specializing in federal tax matters.


	 


	As shown in the accompanying
	consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has accumulated a deficit of approximately
	$19.2 million as of December 31, 2016, and $15.4 million as of December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015,
	we incurred net losses of approximately $4.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively.


	 


	Realization of a major
	portion of our assets as of December 31, 2016, is dependent upon our continued operations. The Company is dependent on generating
	additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. In addition, we have undertaken
	a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern. We continue to focus on developing organic growth in our
	operating companies and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing, aggressive cost management and
	overhead reductions. Critical to achieving profitability will be our ability to license and or sell, permit and operate though
	our joint ventures and licensees our CoronaLux™ waste destruction units. We have increased our business development efforts
	to address opportunities identified in expanding markets attributable to increased interest in energy conservation and emission
	control regulations. In addition, the Company is evaluating various forms of financing which may be available to it. There can
	be no assurance that the Company will secure additional financing for working capital, increase revenues and achieve the desired
	result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years. These financial statements do not give any effect
	to any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to report on a going concern basis.


	 





	Results of Operations



	 



	Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016
	and 2015



	 



	Total
	revenues were $11.7 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of approximately
	$0.9 million or 7% in revenues comparing the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable
	to the decreases in revenues from our industrial cleaning segment which decreased from approximately $5.3 million in 2015 to approximately
	$3.7 million in 2016, a decrease of $1.6 million or approximately 30% and was primarily attributable to a single customer. Our
	railcar cleaning segment revenues were $3.2 million for 2016 compared to $3 million for 2015, an increase of approximately $200,000,
	and the increase was attributable to an increase in the number of railcars serviced during that period. Our environmental solutions
	segment revenue increased from $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31,
	2016, an increase of approximately 41%. The increase is primarily attributable to higher media replacement sales and higher long
	term contract revenues. Our solid waste disposal segment generated $780,500 in 2015 from the sale of 2 CoronaLux™ units,
	but did not generate any revenue from sales of CoronaLux™ units during 2016. The solid waste disposal segment also generated
	licensing and placement fees of $205,000 in 2016 and $110,000 in 2015, freight revenue of $90,000 in 2015 as a result of the delivery
	of CoronaLux™ units in 2015, but $0 in 2016. In addition, the solid waste disposal segment generated approximately $40,000
	in other fees for 2016 compared to $60,000 in other fees for 2015. The solid waste disposal segment has received approximately
	$177,000 in non-refundable fees in 2016 and from inception through December 31, 2016, $815,000, which are being recognized as
	revenue ratably over the term of the agreements.

	Operating
	expenses, which include cost of products, cost of services and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, fixed
	asset and other asset impairment and litigation settlement were approximately $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2016
	compared to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. 1) An increase of product cost of $1.0 million corresponds with
	the increase in product revenue by 41% over 2015, 2) a decrease in service costs of approximately $900,000 associated with a 16%
	decrease in service revenues of $1.3 million, 3) a decrease in SG&A of approximately $1.0 million comparing 2015 to 2016,
	this was a result of decrease of professional fees of $0.14 million, rent of $.07 million, marketing of $.07 million, salaries
	of $.20 million, share compensation of $0.22 million, subcontractors and fuel of $0.23 million, research and development of $0.28
	million and an increase in insurance of $0.05 million and bad debts of $0.21 million, 4) a decrease in solid waste costs of approximately
	$1 million associated with a 77% decrease in solid waste revenues of $800,000. Service costs as a percentage of service revenues
	were 84% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 79% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in margin is due to a
	reduced utilization of equipment and manpower as a result of the significant reduction in service revenue. In 2016 we saw a significant
	decrease in equipment and manpower utilization as a result of a significant decrease in revenue in 2016. Product costs as a percentage
	of product revenues was 76% in 2016 compared to 72% in 2015. The change is not significant but is primarily due to recurring product
	sales that typically have lower margins than the normal one-time long term projects that have higher margins. Solid waste costs
	were $1.4 million in 2015 and $315,000 in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to two factors: 1) no sales of CoronaLux ™
	units in 2016 and 2) an increase in personnel to support the placement and operation of CoronaLux ™ units with customer,
	along with product development and product enhancement activities. SG&A expense decreased from approximately $5.64 million
	for the year ended December 31, 2015, to approximately $4.62 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately
	$1 million. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to 1) a decrease of professional fees of $0.14 million, rent
	of $.07 million, marketing of $.07 million, salaries of $.20 million, share compensation of $0.22 million, subcontractors and
	fuel of $0.23 million, research and development of $0.28 million and an increase in insurance of $0.05 million and bad debts of
	$0.21 million. The slight decrease in salaries and wages in 2016 was due to a reduction on corporate support staff. We impaired,
	in 2016, our idle CoronaLux ™ units in the amount of $809,000, our other long term asset related to Sterall in the amount
	of $720,000 (see Note 11) and accrued a litigation settlement in the amount of $277,000 including the related legal fees.






	Total
	non-operating other income (expense), net was $(45,500) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $(328,000) for the year
	ended December 31, 2016. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to i) an increase in interest expense of $234,000
	as a result of an increase in convertible debt and short-term debt in 2016, ii) a decrease of $50,000 in gain in settlement of
	debt from 2015.



	 


	There is no provision
	for income taxes for both the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, due to our net losses for both periods.


	 





	Net
	loss, before non-controlling interest, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.6 million compared to a net loss, before non-controlling
	interest, of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss attributable to SEER after deducting $753,500 for
	the non-controlling interest was $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $2.8 million, after deducting
	$536,300 in non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2015. As noted above, the 7% decrease in revenue in 2016
	compared to 2015 coupled with the other expenses incurred during 2016 was the primary reason for the increase in the net loss.





	 



	Changes in Cash Flow



	 



	Operating Activities



	 



	Net
	cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $600,400 compared to $115,600 during the year
	ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in operating activities is driven by our net loss and adjusted by non-cash items and
	changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation and amortization of property
	& equipment and intangible assets, stock based compensation expense and in 2016, asset impairment expense. In 2016, net
	non-cash adjustments totaled approximately $2.5 million and in 2015, net non-cash adjustments totaled $962,400. In 2016, the
	net effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in cash by approximately $2.2 million, primarily
	due to the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.4 million, an increase of $503,000 in billings in
	excess of revenue on uncompleted contracts, offset by an increase of $884,600 in accounts receivable and prepaid and other
	assets of $288,700. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the timing of invoicing on client contracts. The
	increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2016 was primarily increases in vendor payables due to the
	significant increase in environmental solutions revenue in 2016. In 2015, the net effect of changes in operating assets and
	liabilities was an increase in cash by approximately $2.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.7
	million and the decrease in fixed assets from the sale of 2 CoronaLux™ units for $780,500. In 2015, other changes in
	operating assets and liabilities offset each other resulting in no significant change in cash. 





	 






	 

	19





	 



	 



	Investing activities



	 


	Net cash used in investing
	activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures. Our net cash used in investing activities was $149,800 for the year
	ended December 31, 2016 and $854,200 for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2016 we had addition to property and equipment of
	$163,700, increases in intangible assets of $45,100 and received $59,000 of insurance proceeds.


	 



	Financing Activities



	 





	Net
	cash provided by financing activities was approximately $726,300 for 2016 and $783,900 for 2015. Proceeds from the sale of common
	stock and exercise and extension of warrants was $454,900 and $0 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Proceeds from the issuance of
	convertible and short-term debt was $1,155,000 and $1,250,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Payments on notes payable and capital
	lease obligations was $424,100 in 2015 and $863,600 in 2016 and payments on related party notes payable was $42,000 in 2015 and
	$20,000 in 2016.





	 


	Overall, our cash changed very minimally
	from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to our net loss from operations offset by lower capital expenditures, sale of common stock and
	exercise and extension of warrants, and debt financing in 2016 that provided some working capital to offset our operating losses.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments
	and Estimates



	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of
	these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.
	GAAP) requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reported amount of assets and liabilities
	and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
	of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount
	of intangible assets; valuation allowances and reserves for receivables, inventory and deferred income taxes; revenue recognition
	related to contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method; share-based compensation; and loss contingencies,
	including those related to litigation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk



	 


	Accounts receivable
	are recorded at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful
	accounts is based on our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable. We determine the allowance
	for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable, historical experience and management judgment. Accounts receivable
	balances are reviewed individually for collectability, and balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that
	the potential for recovery is remote. An allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $300,500 and $246,500 had been reserved
	as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 


	We are exposed to
	credit risk in the normal course of business, primarily related to accounts receivable. Our customers operate primarily in the
	oil production and refining, rail transport, biogas generating and wastewater treatment industries in the United States. Accordingly,
	we are affected by the economic conditions in these industries as well as general economic conditions in the United States. To
	limit credit risk, management periodically reviews and evaluates the financial condition of its customers and maintains an allowance
	for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we do not believe that we have significant credit risk.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial
	Instruments



	 


	The carrying amounts
	of our financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, are carried at cost, which approximates their
	fair value due to their short-term maturities. We believe that the carrying value of notes payable with third parties, including
	their current portion, approximate their fair value, as those instruments carry market interest rates based on our current financial
	condition and liquidity. We believe the amounts due to related parties also approximate their fair value, as their carried interest
	rates are consistent with those of our notes payable with third parties.


	 






	 

	20





	 



	 



	Long-lived Assets



	 


	We evaluate the carrying
	value of long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
	amounts may not be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of an
	asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value. The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the
	carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing
	of estimated future cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized an impairment to five CoronaLux ™
	units of $809,000. No impairment was determined as of December 31, 2015.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	We recognize revenue
	related to contract projects and services when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists,
	(ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability
	is reasonably assured. Our revenue is primarily comprised of services related to industrial cleaning and railcar cleaning, which
	we recognize as services are rendered.


	 


	Product revenue generated
	from projects, which include the manufacturing of products, for removal and treatment of hazardous vapor and gasses is accounted
	for under the percentage-of-completion method for projects with durations in excess of three months and the completed-contract
	method for all other projects. Total estimated revenue includes all of the following: (1) the basic contract price (2) contract
	options and (3) change orders.

	Once contract performance is underway,
	we may experience changes in conditions, client requirements, specifications, designs, materials and expectations regarding the
	period of performance. Such changes are “change orders” and may be initiated by us or by our clients. In many cases,
	agreement with the client as to the terms of change orders is reached prior to work commencing; however, sometimes circumstances
	require that work progress without obtaining client agreement. Revenue related to change orders is recognized as costs are incurred
	if it is probable that costs will be recovered by changing the contract price. The Company does not incur pre-contract costs.

	Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize revenue primarily based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total
	estimated contract costs. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses
	are identified and included as additional loss. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts are shown separately as liabilities
	on the balance sheet, if significant, except in circumstances in which related costs are accumulated on the balance sheet, in which
	case the provisions are deducted from the accumulated costs. A provision as a liability is reported as a current liability.


	 


	For contracts accounted
	for under the percentage-of-completion method, we include in current assets and current liabilities amounts related to construction
	contracts realizable and payable. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent the excess
	of contract costs and profits recognized to date over billings to date, and are recognized as a current asset. Billings in excess
	of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract
	costs and profits recognized to date, and are recognized as a current liability.


	 


	The Company’s
	revenues from waste destruction licensing agreements are recognized as a single accounting unit over the term of the license. 
	In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, for revenues which contain multiple deliverables, the
	Company separates the deliverables into separate accounting units if they meet the following criteria: (i) the delivered items
	have a stand-alone value to the customer; (ii) the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined; and (iii) if
	the arrangement includes a general right of return, delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled
	by the seller.  Deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables into one accounting
	unit.  Revenue from each accounting unit is recognized based on the applicable accounting literature, primarily ASC 605.


	 


	The Company has five-year
	agreements with three companies in which the Company amortizes various fees on a straight-line basis over the initial five-year
	term of the agreement.


	 




	 

	21





	 





	 



	Stock-based
	Compensation



	 


	We account for stock-based
	awards at fair value on the date of grant, and recognize compensation over the service period that they are expected to vest. We
	estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated
	value of the portion of a stock-based award that is ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures,
	is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment,
	and to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures, such differences are accounted for as a cumulative
	adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised.


	 



	Recently issued accounting pronouncements



	 


	Changes to accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standards updates (ASU’s) to the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification. The
	Company considers the applicability and impact of all new or revised ASU’s.


	 



	New Accounting Pronouncements Implemented 



	 









	In
	May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance creating Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	Section 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.  The new section will replace Section 605, “Revenue
	Recognition” and creates modifications to various other revenue accounting standards for specialized transactions and industries. 
	The section is intended to conform revenue accounting principles with a concurrently issued International Financial Reporting
	Standards with previously differing treatment between United States practice and those of much of the rest of the world, as well
	as, to enhance disclosures related to disaggregated revenue information.  The updated guidance was effective for annual reporting
	periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. On July 9, 2015, the FASB
	approved a one year delay of the effective date. The Company will now adopt the new provisions of this accounting standard at
	the beginning of fiscal year 2018.




	 




	In
	June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-12, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting
	for Share-Based Payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service
	period,” (“ASU 2014-12”). Current U.S. GAAP does not contain explicit guidance on whether to treat a performance
	target that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition that affects vesting or as a nonvesting
	condition that affects the grant-date fair value of an award. The new guidance requires that a performance target that affects
	vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance
	target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The updated guidance will be effective for
	annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. The adoption
	of this ASU did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.




	 




	In
	April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” (“ASU
	2015-03”). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance
	sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective
	for the first interim period for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact
	on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.




	 




	In
	July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.” Under this ASU, inventory will
	be measured at the “lower of cost and net realizable value” and options that currently exist for “market value”
	will be eliminated. The ASU defines net realizable value as the “estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business,
	less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.” No other changes were made to the current
	guidance on inventory measurement. ASU 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
	Management is evaluating the provisions of this statement and has not determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will
	have on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.




	 







	 

	22





	 



	 





	In
	September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
	No. 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments”. The new guidance eliminates the requirement
	to retrospectively account for adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. Under the ASU, the adjustments
	to the provisional amounts will be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.




	 




	In
	November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
	No.2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to separate
	deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts. The amendments will require that deferred tax
	liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The updated guidance will
	be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. The Company
	is in the process of evaluating this guidance.




	 




	In
	January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01,

	Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement
	of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

	(“ASU 2016-01”), which requires that (i) all equity investments,
	other than equity-method investments, in unconsolidated entities generally be measured at fair value through earnings and (ii)
	when the fair value option has been elected for financial liabilities, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit
	risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income. Additionally, the ASU 2016-01 changes the disclosure requirements
	for financial instruments. The new standard will be effective for the Company starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early
	adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have
	on its consolidated financial statements as well as whether to adopt certain provisions early.




	 




	In
	February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to leases that outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model and supersedes
	the current lease guidance. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets
	for all leases with lease terms of great than 12 months. It also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure
	requirements of lease arrangements. The new guidance must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach and will be effective
	for the Company starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining
	the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements as well as whether to adopt the new guidance early.




	 




	In March
	2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,

	Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

	(‘ASU
	2016-09”), which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. ASU 2016-09 includes provisions intended
	to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. ASU
	2016-09 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
	that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning
	of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements.

	We carried out an
	evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal
	Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and

	Management’s Annual Report on
	Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is
	responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
	15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
	regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
	that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
	and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded to permit preparation of
	financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
	are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
	prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
	on our financial statements.

	Management assessed
	the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management
	used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
	Treadway Commission (COSO).


	 


	Based on its assessment
	of internal control over financial reporting, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our internal control
	over financial reporting were not effective.


	 


	This Annual Report
	does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
	financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting
	firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s
	report in this Annual Report.


	 



	Changes In Internal Control Over Financial
	Reporting



	 


	There were no significant
	changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2016 that has materially
	affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP
	OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT




	 


	The number of shares
	beneficially owned includes shares of Common Stock with respect to which the persons named below have either investment or voting
	power. A person is also deemed to be the beneficial owner of a security if that person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership
	of that security within 60 days through the exercise of an option or through the conversion of another security. Except as noted,
	each beneficial owner has sole investment and voting power with respect to the Common Stock.


	 


	Common Stock not outstanding
	that is subject to options or other convertible securities or rights is deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the
	percentage of Common Stock beneficially owned by the person holding such options or other convertible securities or rights, but
	is not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of Common Stock beneficially owned by any other person.


	 


	The following table
	sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources’ common stock
	as of December 31, 2016, by (i) each person known to beneficially own more than 5% of the common stock of the Company, (ii) each
	of the Company’s executive officers, (iii) each member of the Board of Directors of the Company and (iv) all of the executive
	officers and Board members as a group. As of December 31, 2016, 54,525,079 shares of our Common Stock were issued and outstanding.

	ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS,
	AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.




	 



	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON
	TRANSACTIONS



	 


	In 2010, the Company
	and Black Stone Management Services, LLC (“Black Stone”) formed PWS whereby 1,000,000 membership units were issued, the
	Company acquired 60% (600,000) of the membership units in PWS and Black Stone acquired 40% (400,000) of the membership units in
	PWS, respectively. Fortunato Villamagna, who serves as President of our subsidiary PWS, is a managing member and Chairman of Black
	Stone. In June 2012, the Company and Blackstone each allocated 10% of their respective membership units in PWS to two individuals,
	Mr. J. John Combs III, a shareholder and CEO/President of the Company and Mr. Michael Cardillo, a shareholder of the Company and
	President of a REGS. There was no value to the units at the time of the allocation. In 2013, Black Stone sold 10% of its membership
	units to a third party receiving 875,000 shares of common stock of the Company and other equity interests. As of December 31, 2016
	and 2015 the Company owns 54% of the membership units, Black Stone owns 26% of the membership units, a third party owns 10% of
	the membership units and two related party individuals, noted above, each own 5% each of the membership units.


	 


	In March 2012, the
	Company entered into an Irrevocable License & Royalty Agreement with PWS that grants PWS an irrevocable world-wide license
	to the IP in exchange for a 5% royalty on all revenues from PWS and its affiliates. The term commenced as of the date of that Agreement
	and will continue for a period not to exceed the life of the patent or patents filed by the Company. PWS may sub license the IP
	and any revenue derived from sub licensing shall be included in the calculation of Gross Revenue for purposes of determining royalty
	payments due the Company. Royalty payments are due 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. PWS generated revenues of approximately
	$156,500 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $118,000 revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, as such, royalties of
	$17,225 and $9,400 were due for 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	In September 2014,
	the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (“Equity Agreement”) with a third party (“Seller”) whereby
	the Company issued 1,200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $1,212,000, in exchange for 22.5 membership
	units, representing 15% ownership interest in Sterall, LLC, a Delaware corporation. In March 2015, the Company and the Seller entered
	into a revised agreement whereby the 1,200,000 shares issued by the Company would be held by the Seller until the completion of
	an independent third party valuation. Based on the fair market value of the Purchased Units from the valuation obtained by the
	Company, an amount of Consideration Shares will be returned to the Company to the extent that the fair market value of the Consideration
	Shares issued (see below) is greater than the fair market value of the Purchased Units. In no event shall the Company be obligated
	to issue additional shares as consideration for the Purchased Units. For purposes of this amendment, the fair market value of each
	Consideration Share will be $0.83333. In the event the parties are unwilling to accept the fair market value of the Purchased Units,
	as determined by the independent valuation specialist, on or before the Closing Date this Agreement (December 31, 2015), the transaction
	may be rescinded by either Party. As of December 31, 2016 an independent appraisal was not performed and the parties, including
	Sterall, are continuing to negotiate an agreement. We have impaired the long-term asset in the amount of $720.000.


	 


	In December 2014,
	PWS, Sterall, Inc and Sterall LLC entered into a Successor-In-Interest Agreement. The Successor-In-Interest Agreement states that
	Sterall Inc and Sterall LLC are in the process of consolidating their business under Sterall LLC and all agreements between PWS
	and Sterall Inc shall be binding in all regards on Sterall LLC.

	Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related

	have identified as related parties prior to the consummation of the transaction.

	As of this filing, only one of the directors

	Board Meetings and committees; annual

	There was one board meeting held in 2016,
	which was attended by two directors. There was one board meeting held in 2015, which was attended by the two directors.


	 


	There is no Nominating Committee for directors,
	which the Company considers reasonable, as there is no direct compensation to directors who are not also officers, and there is
	no liability insurance available for errors and omissions, should they occur. Therefore, the Company has found it extremely difficult
	to attract independent directors.

	5.           The

	(b)           Any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrant’s

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
	ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 



	To the
	Board of Directors and

	Stockholders of Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc.



	 



	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc. as of
	December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash
	flows for the years then ended. Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc.’s management is responsible for
	these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
	audits.



	 



	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
	that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
	basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
	significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
	audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.



	 



	In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
	financial position of Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated
	results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America.



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
	statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses and has a net working capital deficiency. These conditions raise substantial
	doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note
	1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset
	carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as
	a going concern.

	NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND FINANCIAL
	CONDITION



	 



	Organization and Going Concern



	 


	Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources,
	Inc. (“SEER,” “we,” or the “Company”), a Nevada corporation, is a provider of next-generation clean-technologies,
	waste management innovations and related services. SEER has four wholly-owned operating subsidiaries and two majority-owned subsidiaries;
	all of which together provide technology solutions and services to companies primarily in the oil and gas, refining, landfill,
	food, beverage & agriculture and renewable fuel industries. The four wholly-owned subsidiaries include: 1) REGS, LLC (d/b/a
	Resource Environmental Group Services (“REGS”)) provides industrial and proprietary cleaning services to refineries,
	oil fields and other private and governmental entities; 2) Tactical Cleaning Company, LLC (“Tactical”), provides proprietary
	cleaning services related to railcar tankers, tank trucks and frac tanks to customers from its sites in Colorado and Kansas; 3)
	MV, LLC (d/b/a MV Technologies) (“MV”), designs and builds biogas conditioning solutions for the production of renewable
	natural gas, odor control systems and natural gas vapor capture primarily for landfill operations, waste-water treatment facilities,
	oil and gas fields, refineries, municipalities and food, beverage & agriculture operations throughout the U.S.; 4) Strategic
	Environmental Materials, LLC,(“SEM”), a materials technology company focused on development of cost-effective chemical
	absorbents.


	 


	The two majority-owned subsidiaries include;
	1) Paragon Waste Solutions, LLC (“PWS”) and 2) ReaCH4Biogas (“Reach”). PWS is currently owned 54% by SEER (see
	Note 7) and Reach is owned 85% by SEER.


	 


	PWS is developing specific opportunities
	to deploy and commercialize patented technologies for a non-thermal plasma-assisted oxidation process that makes possible the clean
	and efficient destruction of solid hazardous chemical and biological waste (

	i.e

	., regulated medical waste, chemicals, pharmaceuticals
	and refinery tank waste,

	etc

	.) without landfilling or traditional incineration and without harmful emissions. Additionally,
	PWS’ technology “cleans” and conditions emissions and gaseous waste streams (

	Reach (the trade name for BeneFuels, LLC),
	is currently owned 85% by SEER and focuses specifically on treating biogas for conversion to pipeline quality gas and/or compressed
	natural gas (“CNG”) for fleet vehicle fuel. Reach had minimal operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 



	Principals of Consolidation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements include the accounts of SEER, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, REGS, TCC, MV and SEM and its majority-owned subsidiaries
	PWS and Reach, since their respective acquisition or formation dates. All material intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits
	have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has non-controlling interest in joint ventures, which are reported on the equity
	method.


	 



	Going Concern



	 




	As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial
	statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has accumulated a deficit of approximately $19.2 million as of December
	31, 2016, and $15.3 million as of December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, we incurred net losses before
	adjustment for losses attributable to non-controlling interest of approximately $4.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The
	Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $4.0 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.3 million in the working
	capital deficit of $2.7 million at December 31, 2015. Effective April 1, 2016, REGS, a wholly owned subsidiary, was notified that
	it would no longer be providing routine maintenance services to its largest customer but would still be eligible to provide other
	industrial cleaning services. The loss of revenue from this customer was approximately $2.5 million in 2016. These factors raise
	substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue to operate as a going concern.

	NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND FINANCIAL
	CONDITION, continued



	 



	Going Concern, continued



	 


	Realization of a major portion of our assets as of December 31, 2016, is dependent upon our continued operations.
	The Company is dependent on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes
	profitable. The Company opened two additional rail car cleaning facilities, one in the Midwest (Illinois) and one on the East Coast
	(Maryland) during 2016 that began to offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the oil refinery sector. For
	the year ended December 31, 2016 we raised $355,000 in convertible debt financing and we raised $454,900 from the sale of common
	stock and exercise and extension of common stock warrants. In addition, we have undertaken a number of specific steps to continue
	to operate as a going concern. We continue to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies and improving gross
	and net margins through increased attention to pricing, aggressive cost management and overhead reductions. Critical to achieving
	profitability will be our ability to license and or sell, permit and operate though our joint ventures and licensees our CoronaLux™
	waste destruction units. We have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding markets
	attributable to increased interest in energy conservation and emission control regulations. In addition, the Company is evaluating
	various forms of financing which may be available to it. There can be no assurance that the Company will secure additional financing
	for working capital, increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future
	years.

	These financial statements do not give any effect
	to any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to report on a going concern basis.

	Reclassifications



	 


	Certain reclassifications have been made
	in the 2015 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2016 presentation.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of these consolidated financial
	statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to
	make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
	the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the cash flows used in the impairment testing of
	definite lived tangible and intangible assets; valuation allowances and reserves for receivables; revenue recognition related to
	contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method; and share-based compensation. Actual results could differ from
	those estimates.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	We consider all highly liquid debt investments
	with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Periodically, we maintain
	deposits in financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts
	and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we
	did not hold any assets that would be deemed to be cash equivalents.

	Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk



	 





	Accounts
	receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
	based on our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable. We determine the allowance for doubtful
	accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable, historical experience and management judgment. Accounts receivable balances
	are periodically reviewed for collectability, and balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that the potential
	for recovery is remote.

	An allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $300,500 and $246,500 had been reserved as
	of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 


	We are exposed to credit risk in the normal
	course of business, primarily related to accounts receivable. Our customers operate primarily in the oil production and refining,
	rail transport, biogas generating landfill and wastewater treatment industries in the United States. Accordingly, we are affected
	by the economic conditions in these industries as well as general economic conditions in the United States. To limit credit risk,
	management periodically reviews and evaluates the financial condition of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful
	accounts. As of December 31, 2016, we do not believe that we have significant credit risk.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016 we had no one customer
	who comprised 10% or more of our accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2015, we had one customer who comprised 32% of our accounts
	receivable.


	 




	For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
	we had one customer with sales in excess of 10% of our revenue and they represented approximately 17% and 35% of total revenues
	for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The loss of this customer, or a material reduction in revenue from
	this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and our working capital. In early
	2016 we were notified by this significant customer that effective April 1, 2016 we would no longer be providing routine maintenance
	services but still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services. During 2016, the loss of revenue from this customer
	was approximately $2.5 million.


	 



	Inventories



	 


	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and maintained
	on a first in, first out basis.


	 



	Vendor Concentration



	 


	The Company does not have any purchases
	from any one vendor comprising more that 10% of total purchases for 2016 and 2015. The Company does not believe it is substantially
	dependent upon nor exposed to any significant concentration risk related to purchases from any single vendor.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial
	Instruments



	 


	The carrying amounts of our financial instruments,
	including accounts receivable and accounts payable, are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value due to their short-term
	maturities. We believe that the carrying value of notes payable with third parties, including their current portion, approximate
	their fair value, as those instruments carry market interest rates based on our current financial condition and liquidity. We believe
	the amounts due to related parties also approximate their fair value, as their carried interest rates are consistent with those
	of our notes payable with third parties.

	NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued



	 



	Fair Value



	 


	As defined in authoritative guidance, fair
	value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
	participants at the measurement date (“exit price”). To estimate fair value, the Company utilizes market data or assumptions
	that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and risks inherent in the
	inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.


	 


	The authoritative guidance establishes
	a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
	quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (“Level 1” measurements) and the lowest priority
	to unobservable inputs (“Level 3” measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:


	 


	Level 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted
	prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.


	 


	Level 2 - Other inputs that are observable,
	directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or
	indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.


	 


	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for which
	there is little or no market data and which the Company makes its own assumptions about how market participants would price the
	assets and liabilities.


	 


	In instances in which multiple levels of
	inputs are used to measure fair value, hierarchy classification is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
	value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
	in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.


	 



	Property and Equipment



	 



	Property
	and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.

	Expenditures for replacements, renewals and betterments
	are capitalized.

	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.



	 



	Depreciation
	is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of

	generally five to seven years
	for equipment, five to ten years for vehicles and three years for computer related assets. Assets are depreciated starting at the
	time they are placed into service. A portion of depreciation expense is charged to cost of product revenue on the consolidated
	statement of operations.


	 


	Leasehold improvements are amortized using
	the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term (including reasonably assured renewal periods), which range from three
	to seven years, or their estimated useful life.


	 



	Intangible Assets



	 





	Intangible
	assets with estimable useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives verses
	their estimated residual values, and are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying
	amount may not be recoverable. We conduct our annual impairment test on December 31 of each year.

	The Company has evaluated
	its intangibles for impairment and has determined that no impairment was necessary as of December 31, 2016. No impairment was necessary
	as of December 31, 2015.

	Impairment of Long-lived
	Assets



	 


	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived
	assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may
	not be recoverable. Further testing of specific assets or grouping of assets is required when undiscounted future cash flows associated
	with the assets is less than their carrying amounts. An asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future
	cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value. The amount of impairment recognized is the difference
	between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the
	amount and timing of estimated future cash flows. No impairment was necessary as of December 31, 2015, however, as of December
	31, 2016 the Company determined an impairment to five CoronaLux ™ units of $809,000 incurred due to lack of sale or license
	of the five units for a period of more than 12 months since completion of the units.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	We recognize revenue related to contract
	projects and services when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (ii) delivery
	has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably
	assured. Our revenue is primarily comprised of services related to industrial cleaning and railcar cleaning, which we recognize
	as services are rendered.


	 


	Product revenue generated from projects,
	which include the manufacturing of products, for removal and treatment of hazardous vapor and gasses is accounted for under the
	percentage-of-completion method for projects with durations in excess of three months and the completed-contract method for all
	other projects. Total estimated revenue includes all of the following: (1) the basic contract price, (2) contract options, and
	(3) change orders.

	Once contract performance is underway, we may experience
	changes in conditions, client requirements, specifications, designs, materials and expectations regarding the period of performance.
	Such changes are “change orders” and may be initiated by us or by our clients. In many cases, agreement with the client
	as to the terms of change orders is reached prior to work commencing; however, sometimes circumstances require that work progress
	without obtaining client agreement. Revenue related to change orders is recognized as costs are incurred if it is probable that
	costs will be recovered by changing the contract price. The Company does not incur pre-contract costs.

	Under the percentage-of-completion
	method, we recognize revenue primarily based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Provisions
	for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses are identified and included as additional
	loss. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts are shown separately as liabilities on the balance sheet, if significant, except
	in circumstances in which related costs are accumulated on the balance sheet, in which case the provisions are deducted from the
	accumulated costs. A provision as a liability is reported as a current liability.


	 


	For contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion
	method, we include in current assets and current liabilities amounts related to construction contracts realizable and payable.
	Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent the excess of contract costs and profits
	recognized to date over billings to date, and are recognized as a current asset. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings
	on uncompleted contracts represents the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits recognized to
	date, and are recognized as a current liability.


	 


	The Company’s revenues from waste
	destruction licensing agreements are recognized as a single accounting unit over the term of the license.  In accordance with
	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, for revenues which contain multiple deliverables, the Company separates
	the deliverables into separate accounting units if they meet the following criteria: (i) the delivered items have a stand-alone
	value to the customer; (ii) the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined; and (iii) if the arrangement includes
	a general right of return, delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller.  Deliverables
	that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables into one accounting unit.  Revenue from each
	accounting unit is recognized based on the applicable accounting literature, primarily ASC 605.

	The Company has five-year agreements with

	Stock-based
	Compensation



	 


	We account for stock-based awards at fair
	value on the date of grant, and recognize compensation over the service period that they are expected to vest. We estimate the
	fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated value of the
	portion of a stock-based award that is ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures, is recognized
	as expense over the requisite service periods. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to
	the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures, such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment
	to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised.


	 



	Research and Development



	 


	Research and development (“R&D”) costs are charged to expense as incurred and are included in
	selling, general and administrative costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

	R&D
	expenses consist primarily of salaries, project materials, contract labor and other costs associated with ongoing product development
	and enhancement efforts. R&D expenses were $192,400 and $491,200 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
	R & D expenses are included in general and administrative expenses.



	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant
	to

	Accounting Standards Codification

	(“ASC”) 740,

	Income Taxes,

	which utilizes the asset and liability
	method of computing deferred income taxes. The objective of this method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for
	any temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities at enacted
	tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled.


	 


	ASC 740 also provides detailed guidance
	for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements.
	Tax positions must meet a “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. During
	the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized no adjustments for uncertain tax positions.


	 


	The Company recognizes interest and penalties
	related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. No interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were recognized
	at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company expects no material changes to unrecognized tax positions within the next twelve months.


	 


	The Company has filed federal and state
	tax returns through December 31, 2015. The tax periods for the years ending December 31, 2009 through 2015 are open to examination
	by federal and state authorities.


	 



	Recently issued accounting pronouncements



	 


	Changes to accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the
	form of accounting standards updates (ASU’s) to the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers
	the applicability and impact of all new or revised ASU’s.

	New Accounting Pronouncements Implemented



	 




	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (FASB) issued guidance creating Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Section 606, “Revenue from Contracts
	with Customers”.  The new section will replace Section 605, “Revenue Recognition” and creates modifications
	to various other revenue accounting standards for specialized transactions and industries.  The section is intended to conform
	revenue accounting principles with a concurrently issued International Financial Reporting Standards with previously differing
	treatment between United States practice and those of much of the rest of the world, as well as, to enhance disclosures related
	to disaggregated revenue information.  The updated guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
	December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one year delay of
	the effective date. The Company will now adopt the new provisions of this accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2018.




	 




	In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
	Update No. 2014-12, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments when the terms of
	an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period,” (“ASU 2014-12”).
	Current U.S. GAAP does not contain explicit guidance on whether to treat a performance target that could be achieved after the
	requisite service period as a performance condition that affects vesting or as a nonvesting condition that affects the grant-date
	fair value of an award. The new guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after
	the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in
	estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The updated guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact
	on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.




	 




	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying
	the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” (“ASU 2015-03”). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related
	to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability,
	consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for the first interim period for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2015. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results
	of operations.


	 




	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,
	“Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.” Under this ASU, inventory will be measured at the “lower of cost
	and net realizable value” and options that currently exist for “market value” will be eliminated. The ASU defines
	net realizable value as the “estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs
	of completion, disposal, and transportation.” No other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement.
	ASU 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Management is evaluating the provisions
	of this statement and has not determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have on the Company’s financial position
	or results of operations

	.





	 


	In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
	Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments”. The new guidance
	eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination.
	Under the ASU, the adjustments to the provisional amounts will be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts
	are determined. The updated guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods
	within those fiscal years.

	In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
	Update (“ASU”) No.2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”. The new guidance eliminates
	the requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts. The amendments will
	require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The
	updated guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual
	periods. The Company is in the process of evaluating this guidance.


	 


	In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
	Standards Update No. 2016-01,

	Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

	(“ASU 2016-01”), which requires that (i) all equity investments, other than equity-method investments, in unconsolidated
	entities generally be measured at fair value through earnings and (ii) when the fair value option has been elected for financial
	liabilities, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive
	income. Additionally, the ASU 2016-01 changes the disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The new standard will be effective
	for the Company starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The Company is
	in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements as well as whether to
	adopt certain provisions early.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance
	related to leases that outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model and supersedes the current lease guidance. The new guidance
	requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms of great
	than 12 months. It also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. The new
	guidance must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach and will be effective for the Company starting in the first
	quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will
	have on its consolidated financial statements as well as whether to adopt the new guidance early.

	Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

	(‘ASU 2016-09”), which amends ASC Topic
	718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. ASU 2016-09 includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how
	share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public entities
	for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption
	is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
	The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements.

	NOTE 7 - INVESTMENT IN PARAGON WASTE SOLUTIONS
	LLC



	 




	In 2010, the Company and Black Stone Management
	Services, LLC (“Black Stone”) formed PWS, whereby a total of 1,000,000 membership units were issued, 600,000 membership
	units to the Company and 400,000 membership units to Black Stone. Fortunato Villamagna, who serves as President of our PWS subsidiary,
	is a managing member and Chairman of Black Stone. In June 2012, the Company and Blackstone each allocated 10% of their respective
	membership units in PWS to Mr. J John Combs III, an officer and shareholder of the Company and Mr. Michael Cardillo, a shareholder
	of the Company and an officer of a subsidiary. There was no value attributable to the units at the time of the allocation. At
	December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company owned 54% of the membership units, Black Stone owned 26% of the membership units, an outside
	third party 10% of the membership units and two related parties (as noted above), each owned 5% of the membership units.


	 


	In August, 2011, we acquired certain intellectual
	property in regards to waste destruction technology (the “IP”) from Black Stone in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of
	our common stock valued at $100,000. We estimated the useful life of the IP at ten years, which was consistent with the useful
	life of other technology included in our intangible assets, and management’s initial assessment of the potential marketability
	of the IP. In March 2012, the Company entered into an Irrevocable License & Royalty Agreement with PWS that grants PWS an
	irrevocable world-wide license to the IP in exchange for a 5% royalty on all revenues from PWS and its affiliates. The term commenced
	as of the date of the Agreement and shall continue for a period not to exceed the life of the patent or patents filed by the Company.
	PWS may sub license the IP and any revenue derived from sub licensing shall be included in the calculation of Gross Revenue for
	purposes of determining royalty payments due the Company. Royalty payments are due 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter.
	PWS generated licensing revenues of approximately $156,500 and $118,200 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
	as such, royalties of $17,225 and $9,400 were due at December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 


	Since its inception through December 31,
	2016, we have provided approximately $5.6 million in funding to PWS for working capital and the further development and construction
	of various prototypes and commercial waste destruction units. No members of PWS have made capital contributions or other funding
	to PWS other than SEER. The intent of the operating agreement is that we will provide the funding as an advance against future
	earnings distributions made by PWS.

	Licensing Agreements



	 


	In September 2013, PWS entered into an
	Exclusive Use License and Joint Operations Agreement (“License Agreement”) with Sterall Inc. (“Sterall”).
	The License Agreement granted Sterall the use of the PWS Technology and the CoronaLux™ waste destruction units for an initial
	five year term in the State of Florida and renewable for two additional five year terms, for the treatment and/or destruction
	of any and all regulated medical waste from any sources. The agreement required Sterall to pay a $300,000 License Initiation Fee
	and in order for Sterall to maintain its exclusive license for the State of Florida, a total of $200,000 was to be paid to PWS
	by May 23, 2014, regardless of net operating profits of Sterall (“NOP”). During the initial 5-year term, a minimum of
	$500,000 of total royalty payments to PWS must be made either from NOP or otherwise (in addition to the $300,000 Initial Fee,
	set forth below), in order for the second-phase five-year term to be exclusive. During the second-phase five-year term, a minimum
	of $750,000 of royalty must be paid, out of NOP or otherwise, in order for the third phase five-year term to be exclusive. PWS
	will receive a one-time license initiation fee of $300,000 payable from NOP of Sterall as a priority payment before any other
	distributions or payouts. Sterall can take delivery of additional CoronaLux™ waste destruction units upon payment of a placement
	fee per unit of either $168,000 or $207,000 depending upon the size of the unit. The unit placement fees do not include freight,
	start-up and commissioning costs, which shall be borne by the facility. PWS, at its sole discretion will select the installation,
	startup and commissioning teams. Sterall has not generated any NOP and has not paid any licensing fees to PWS as required by the
	License Agreement, including the minimum payments required under the agreement. Black Stone is a minority shareholder of Sterall.


	 


	In 2014, Sterall ordered a total of six CoronaLux™ units, of which one unit was delivered during the
	year ending December 31, 2014, and five units are pending delivery at December 31, 2016. Sterall paid a non-refundable placement
	fee of $236,300 for the unit delivered in 2014. The fee is being recognized over the term of the agreement. Sterall also has paid
	a deposit of $330,000 for the five units ordered and a balance of $851,500 is still owed and has been fully reserved by the Company.


	 


	On February 22, 2014, SEER and PWS entered
	into an Agreement with Daniel McAteer & Associates (“DMA”) to develop, permit and exploit the PWS waste destruction
	technology in Ireland and United Kingdom (“Limited Territory”). The Agreement called for the formation of a Joint Venture
	to be owned 50% by SEER and 50% by DMA. In accordance with the agreement, DMA was to pay a one-time license fee of $350,000 for
	an exclusive license for the limited purpose of medical waste destruction in the Limited Territory. On June 10, 2014 Paragon Waste
	(UK) Ltd (“Paragon UK”, “UK Joint Venture”), was formed in accordance with the laws of Northern Ireland. A
	total of 300,100 shares were issued upon formation, 100 Ordinary A voting shares were issued, of which PWS received 50 Ordinary
	A shares and 300,000 Ordinary B non-voting shares were issued. In 2015, the Agreement with DMA was amended to where Paragon UK
	purchased the CoronaLux™ unit from PWS for $350,000. Operations to date of the Paragon UK Joint Venture have been limited
	to formation, the delivery of a CoronaLux™ unit with a third party in the United Kingdom and application and permitting
	efforts with regulatory entities. As of December 31, 2016 a balance of $176,000 is still owed and has been fully reserved by the
	Company.


	 






	On March 4, 2014, PWS entered into a Licensing
	and Equipment Lease Agreement with eCycling International of South Carolina, LLC (“eCycling”). The License Agreement
	grants to eCycling the use of the PWS Technology and the CoronaLux™ waste destruction units for an initial term of five years
	and requires a payment of $176,875 as a non-refundable initial licensing fee and distributions of 50% of net operating profits,
	as defined in the agreement, in lieu of continuing royalty payments for the use of the licensed technology. eCycling originally
	paid the $176,875 placement fee to PWS and an additional $176,875 per the amended agreement during the year ended December 31,
	2016 and the revenue is being recognized over the term of the Agreement.

	NOTE 7 - INVESTMENT IN PARAGON WASTE SOLUTIONS
	LLC, continued



	 




	On November 17, 2014, PWS entered into an Exclusive
	Licensing and Equipment Lease Agreement, for a limited license territory, with Medical Waste Services, LLC (“MWS”). The
	License Agreement grants to MWS the use of the PWS Technology and the CoronaLux™ waste destruction units for an initial term
	of seven years and requires a payment of $225,000 as a non-refundable initial licensing fee and distributions of 50% of net operating
	profits, as defined in the agreement, in lieu of continuing royalty payments for the use of the licensed technology. PWS and Medical
	Waste Services, LLC (“MWS”) formed a contractual joint venture to exploit the PWS medical waste destruction technology
	through the permitting and approved for commercial operations by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (“SCAQMD”)
	and the California Department of Public Health a CoronaLux™ unit licensed by MWS. Operations to date have included the destruction
	of medical waste under a temporary operating permit issued by SCAQMD since May 2015 and efforts to obtain a full operating permit
	from SCAQMD were successful and SCAQMD issued a ‘Notice of Intent to Issue Permit to Operate’ in March 2017.




	 


	In February 2015, PWS entered into a License
	Agreement with Particle Science Tech of Environmental Protection, Inc (“Particle”) a US subsidiary of Xinhua Energy
	Environmental Technology Co., Ltd (“Xinhua”), a large multi-national environmental company based in China. The agreement
	provides for the exclusive rights to distribute PWS’s patented technology in China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Taiwan territories
	(“Territory”). The grant was for both the medical waste, as well as the refinery vertical markets within the Territory.
	The Agreement calls for, among other things, the formation of a U.S. joint venture company, (“P&P Company”), to
	be owned 50/50 by PWS and Particle) and an obligation by Xinhua to fund all necessary and reasonable capital requirements to permit
	and roll out the PWS technology in the Territory as well as staff and manage the JV Entity’s operations. In 2015, PWS sold
	a CoronaLux™ unit to Xinhua for $430,500.


	 


	Upon the occurrence of certain events
	and timely performance by Xinhua, a second placement fee of $350,000 is required to be paid and, upon that second payment, it
	will then be granted exclusive manufacturing rights to produce the units to be deployed in the Territory.


	 


	Payments received for non-refundable licensing
	and placement fees have been recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016
	and 2015 and are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract.


	 



	NOTE 8 - INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT
	VENTURES



	 


	The Company has a non-controlling interest
	in several joint ventures, currently three primarily for licensing and operating PWS CoronaLux™ waste destruction units
	and one for development of hybrid scrubber systems. Two joint ventures have limited their activity to formation only, no other
	operations have commenced. The following is summary information on the joint ventures that have had some activity in 2016 and
	2015. The Company has no fixed commitment to fund any losses of the operating joint ventures and has no investment basis in any
	of the joint ventures therefore the Company has suspended the recognition of losses under the equity method of accounting.

	NOTE 9 - PAYROLL TAXES PAYABLE



	 


	In 2009 and 2010, REGS, a subsidiary of
	the Company, became delinquent for unpaid federal employer and employee payroll taxes, accrued interest and penalties were incurred
	related to these unpaid payroll taxes.


	 


	In or around 2010, REGS retained Washington D.C.-based legal counsel specializing in resolving federal tax
	matters. REGS has been represented by this firm throughout all phases of this tax matter and related proceedings. In September
	2011, REGS received approval from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to begin paying the outstanding federal payroll
	tax liability plus the related incurred interest and penalties totaling approximately $971,000 in installments (the “Installment
	Plan”). Under the Installment Plan, REGS was required to pay minimum monthly installments of $12,500 commencing September
	2011, which increased to $25,000 per month in September 2012, until the liability was paid in full. Through the duration of the
	Installment Plan, the IRS continues to charge penalties and interest at statutory rates. If the conditions of the Installment Plan
	were not met, the IRS could cancel the installment plan and could demand the outstanding liability to be repaid through traditional
	enforcement proceedings available to the IRS. Additionally, the IRS has filed a notice of federal tax lien against certain of REGS
	assets in order to secure the obligation. The IRS is to release this lien if and when we pay the full amount due.


	 


	Two of the officers of REGS also have
	liability exposure for a portion of the taxes if REGS does not pay them.


	 


	In May 2013, REGS filed an Offer in Compromise
	(“OIC”) with the IRS. While the OIC was under review by the IRS, the requirement to pay $25,000 a month under the Installment
	Plan was suspended. REGS was informed by its legal counsel that the IRS had accepted REGS’ OIC. However by a letter dated
	March 27, 2014, REGS was notified that the OIC had been rejected. REGS then appealed that rejections decision. However that appeal
	has been denied. As a result, the Installment Plan is terminated. In June 2014, REGS received notices of intent to levy property
	or rights to property from the IRS for the amounts owed for the past due payroll taxes, penalty and interest. The IRS has not
	taken any current action against REGS and REGS continues to be represented by its legal counsel.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the
	outstanding balance due to the IRS was $993,300, and $970,500, respectively.


	 




	Other than this outstanding payroll tax matter
	arising in 2009 and 2010, all state and federal taxes have been paid by REGS in a timely manner.




	 



	NOTE 10 - DEBT



	 




	In June 2011, we issued an unsecured promissory
	note to a third party in the amount of $40,000 (the “June 2011 Note”) bearing interest at a rate of 10% per annum and
	a three year warrant to purchase 13,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. In addition, a second
	note payable, to the same third party, in the amount of $25,000 plus $3,000 of accrued interest was also converted into the June
	2011 Note, resulting in a new principal balance of $68,000. Principal payments were due beginning November 2011 and the June 2011
	Note and accrued interest was paid in full during August 2016 through an offset to trade accounts receivable from the note holder.

	NOTE 10 - DEBT, continued



	 




	The Company entered into a loan agreement
	evidenced by a convertible secured promissory note with Advanced Technology Materials, Inc. (“ATMI”) on February 14,
	2012. The amount of the convertible secured promissory note was $225,000. The loan agreement allowed for an additional $225,000
	to be borrowed upon meeting certain defined milestones and stipulates the Company provide the lenders, among other things, a security
	agreement which also identifies the collateral, a development agreement, and use the loan proceeds for projects and transactions
	contemplated in the term sheet and development agreement. The registration rights agreement has not been executed by the parties
	to the loan. The note bears interest at 5 percent per annum. The entire loan and/or unpaid balance of the loan and accrued interest
	could be converted into the Company’s common stock at $0.50 per share at any time at the option of the holder. In December
	2014, the promissory note and accrued interest was purchased by two shareholders of the Company from ATMI. In January 2015 the
	convertible promissory note and accrued interest totaling $257,400 was converted into approximately 514,800 shares on common stock
	in accordance with the terms on the original convertible note.

	In March 2012, the Company entered into
	an Irrevocable License & Royalty Agreement with PWS that grants PWS an irrevocable world-wide license to the IP in exchange
	for a 5% royalty on all revenues from PWS and its affiliates. The term shall commence as of the date of this Agreement and shall
	continue for a period not to exceed the life of the patent or patents filed by the Company. PWS may sub license the IP and any
	revenue derived from sub licensing shall be included in the calculation of Gross Revenue for purposes of determining royalty payments
	due the Company. Royalty payments are due 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. PWS generated licensing revenues of
	approximately $156,500 and $118,200 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as such, royalties of $17,225
	and $9,400 were due for 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 


	In August 2014, the Company entered into

	intellectual property (“IP”) from Black Stone in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $1,050,000.
	In 2015 the Company and Black Stone executed a rescission agreement of the New Technologies Agreement noted above that was effective
	December 31, 2014. The shares issued by the Company in accordance with the agreement were returned and all acquired IP returned
	to Black Stone.


	 


	In September 2014, the Company entered
	into an Equity Purchase Agreement (“Equity Agreement”) with a third party (“Seller”) whereby the Company issued
	1,200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $1,212,000, in exchange for 22.5 membership interest units, representing
	15% ownership interest in Sterall, LLC, a Delaware corporation. In March 2015 the Company and the Seller entered into a revised
	agreement whereby the 1,200,000 shares issued by the Company would be held by the Seller until the completion of an independent
	third party valuation. Based on the fair market value of the Purchased Units from the valuation obtained by the Company, an amount
	of Consideration Shares will be returned to the Company to the extent that the fair market value of the Consideration Shares issued
	(see below) are greater than the fair market value of the Purchased Units. In no event shall the Company be obligated to issue
	additional shares as consideration for the Purchased Units. For purposes of this amendment, the fair market value of each Consideration
	Share will be $0.83333. In the event the parties are unwilling to accept the fair market value of the Purchased Units, as determined
	by the independent valuation specialist, on or before the Closing Date this Agreement, the transaction covered by this Agreement
	(the “Contemplated Transaction”) may be rescinded by either Party in writing.


	 




	In December 2014, PWS, Sterall, Inc and Sterall
	LLC entered into a Successor-In-Interest Agreement. The Successor-In-Interest Agreement states that Sterall Inc and Sterall LLC
	are in the process of consolidating their business under Sterall LLC and all agreements between PWS and Sterall Inc shall be binding
	in all regards Sterall LLC.


	 


	In October 2014, PWS and Medical Waste Services,
	LLC (“MWS”) formed a contractual joint venture to exploit the PWS medical waste destruction technology. In 2015, MWS
	licensed and installed a CoronaLux unit at an MWS facility, and subsequently received a limited permit to operate. Operations to
	date have included the destruction of medical waste. For the year ended December 31, 2016, PWS has recorded $15,700 in income which
	represents their 50% interest in the net income of the joint venture. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2016, PWS billed
	the joint venture approximately $68,000 in costs incurred on behalf of the joint venture.

	Due to the ability of the Company to rescind the shares issued at
	the commencement of the transaction the shares were considered contingently issuable shares and as such the 1,200,000 share not
	considered issued and outstanding at December 31, 2015. The 15% ownership interest in Sterall was considered contingently held
	until the conclusion of this transaction.


	 


	As of December 31, 2015 an independent appraisal
	was not performed and the Amended Equity Agreement expired by its terms. The 1,200,000 shares subject to the original Equity Agreement
	and the Amended Equity Agreement became unrestricted in 2016 and are now considered issued and outstanding. The shares were valued
	at $720,000 and have been recorded as a long term other asset pending resolution of claims by the parties involved related to the
	Sterall licensing agreement from September 2013, Sterall equipment deposits of $330,000 from 2014 and the equity purchase agreement
	noted above. As of December 31, 2016, a settlement has not been reached by the parties however, they continue to negotiate an agreement.
	We have impaired the long term asset in the amount of $720.000.

	NOTE 14 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE
	BENEFIT PLAN



	 


	Except as noted below, we do not have a
	qualified stock option plan, but have issued stock purchase warrants and stock options on a discretionary basis to employees, directors,
	service providers, private placement participants and outside consultants.


	 


	On November 6, 2013, the Board of Directors
	of the Company adopted the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”) and directed that it be presented to the shareholders
	for their adoption and approval. The 2013 Plan was not approved by the shareholders of the Company and on December 1, 2014 The
	Board of Directors terminated the Plan. No shares were ever issued pursuant to the 2013 Plan.


	 




	The Company utilizes ASC 718,

	Stock
	Compensation,

	related to accounting for share-based payments and, accordingly, records compensation expense for share-based
	awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for stock options and restricted stock awards. The Black Scholes
	option pricing model was used to estimate the fair value of the options granted. This option pricing model requires a number of
	assumptions, of which the most significant are: expected stock price volatility, the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate, and
	the expected option term (the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire). The Company estimated
	a volatility factor utilizing a weighted average of comparable published volatilities. The Company applied the simplified method
	to determine the expected term of grants. The risk free interest rate is based on or approximates the U.S. Treasury yield curve
	in effect at the time of the grant.




	Stock compensation expense for stock options
	is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. The Company accounts for stock options as equity awards.


	 


	Share-based compensation expense recognized
	in the statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, which considers estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures
	are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
	The Company recognizes the expense or benefit from the effect of adjusting the estimated forfeiture rate in the period that the
	forfeiture estimate changes.


	 


	The weighted average estimated fair value
	of stock option grants and the weighted average assumptions that were used in calculating such values for the years ended December
	31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and
	2015, we recorded stock-based compensation awarded to employees of $64,600 and $117,200, respectively, which is included in selling,
	general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

	Employee Benefit Plan



	 


	We have a defined contribution 401(k) plan
	that covers substantially all employees. Additionally, at the discretion of management, we may make contributions to eligible participants,
	as defined. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we made contributions of $0 and approximately $55,400, respectively.


	 



	NOTE 15 - NET LOSS PER SHARE



	 


	Basic net loss per share is computed by
	dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net
	loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
	outstanding plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive common
	shares. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation when their effect would be anti-dilutive. For all years
	presented in the consolidated financial statements, all potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the diluted share
	calculations as they were anti-dilutive as a result of the net losses incurred for the respective years. Accordingly, basic shares
	equal diluted shares for all years presented.


	 


	Potentially dilutive securities were comprised of the following:

	NOTE 16 - SEGMENT INFORMATION AND MAJOR SEGMENT CUSTOMERS





	 




	The Company currently has identified
	four segments as follows:




	 






	REGS


	Industrial Cleaning




	TCC


	Rail Car Cleaning




	MV & SEM


	Environmental Solutions




	PWS


	Solid Waste






	 




	Reach is not currently operating
	but when operations commence would be part of the Environmental Solutions segment.


	 


	The composition of our reportable segments is consistent with that used by our chief operating decision maker
	to evaluate performance and allocate resources. All of our operations are located in the U.S. We have not allocated corporate selling,
	general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation to the segments.
	All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.




	 


	Segment information as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for
	the years then ended is as follows:

	NOTE 17 - INCOME TAXES



	 




	As of December 31, 2016, we estimate we will
	have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future federal income tax of approximately $11 million. These carryforwards
	will expire between the years 2028 through 2032. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amount of and the benefit from net operating
	losses that can be carried forward may be limited in certain circumstances. Events that may cause changes in the our tax carryovers
	include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period. Therefore, the amount
	available to offset future taxable income may be limited. We carry a deferred tax valuation allowance equal to 100% of total deferred
	assets. In recording this allowance, we have considered a number of factors, but chiefly, our operating losses from inception.
	We have concluded that a valuation allowance is required for 100% of the total deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not
	that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.




	 


	Deferred tax assets were comprised of the
	following as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:

	NOTE 18 - ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE



	 


	Significant federal environmental laws
	affecting us are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
	and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund Act”, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and
	the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”).


	 


	Pursuant to the EPA’s authorization
	of the RCRA equivalent programs, a number of states have regulatory programs governing the operations and permitting of hazardous
	waste facilities. Our facilities are regulated pursuant to state statutes, including those addressing clean water and clean air.
	Our facilities are also subject to local siting, zoning and land use restrictions. We believe we are in substantial compliance
	with all federal, state and local laws regulating our business.


	 





	NOTE 19 – LITIGATION



	 


	In March 2016, a complaint was filed by a lessor
	of property leased by REGS, a subsidiary of the Company. The month-to-month lease expired February 29, 2016, when REGS vacated
	the property. The landlord made certain claims including property damage, and loss of rents, attorney fees and other costs
	totaling approximately $97,000. REGS engaged defense counsel and zealously opposed the claims. In December 2016,
	the Company and the lessor reached a settlement of $65,000. At December 31, 2016 $39,000 was outstanding and subsequently paid
	in 2017 per the terms of the settlement agreement. The case was dismissed with prejudiced and the matter is closed.


	 


	In January 2016, an employee of SEM was involved
	in a vehicle accident while on Company business. Various actions were filed by the claimants in both state and federal courts.
	In August 2016, an involuntary proceeding was commenced by one of the claimants against SEM under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy code.
	In September 2016, the case was converted to a Chapter 11 under the Bankruptcy code. During the pendency of all actions, SEM continued
	to manage its affairs and operate normally. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the parties reached a settlement concerning the distribution
	of insurance proceeds and all issues of liability.

	See

	Note 20.


	 



	NOTE 20 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



	 


	Effective as of January 9, 2017, we entered
	into an employment agreement with Richard Robertson in connection with his services as COO of SEER and President of MV Technologies.
	Mr. Robertson’s employment agreement is for a term of one year but shall automatically renew for succeeding terms of one
	year unless written notice is given by either party 30 days prior to the expiration of any term. Pursuant to the terms of his employment
	agreement dated January 9, 2017, Mr. Robertson would receive an annual base salary of $165,000. In addition, Mr. Robertson will
	be eligible for discretionary bonuses for services to be performed as an executive officer of the Company.

Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc. Provides Update on Paragon Waste Solutions Division

		  Newly-Formed JV with UK-based Partner for CoronaLux™ Units Announces First Unit DeploymentExisting Paragon Deployments and Partnerships Continue to Progress

GOLDEN, Colo., Sept. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc. ("SEER") (OTCQB: SENR) today provided a global operations update on its technology division, Paragon Waste Solutions ("PWS"). The updates address the division's newly launched joint venture in the UK, its 6-month-old joint venture in China, and its ongoing operations throughout the United States. 
Paragon UK
In October 2014 Paragon UK, our UK-based subsidiary, entered into an exclusive joint venture agreement with its UK-based partner to deploy SEER's CoronaLux™ technology throughout the territories of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Paragon UK has entered into an agreement with an established medical waste treatment facility to be the first in the country to deploy a large volume CoronaLux system.  The product's shipment is scheduled for delivery in the next week, regulatory approval is expected to reach "final determination" status by the end of September, and installation, start-up and commissioning has been scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year. The Company's partner for Paragon UK has been working to facilitate permitting and installation with one of the largest and well established European-based engineering firms with extensive experience in all facets of waste resource management, spanning technology selection and procurement, facility design, engineering, contract performance, financial and waste flow modelling, sustainability and project delivery.
"Our newly formed partnership with a well-financed and well-recognized, industrial leader with strong relationships throughout the European environmental and waste markets signals a very positive step in the global advancement and commercial adoption of our innovative CoronaLux technology," said Fortunato Villamagna, PWS's CEO and President. "We are excited about our launch into the UK market and expect to announce the deployment of additional systems throughout the UK and elsewhere in Europe in conjunction with our new partner in the coming quarters." 
Paragon China
Paragon-Pinnacle Environmental Solutions is PWS's recently formed JV with a Chinese partner, a well-established and prominent industrial equipment manufacturer in China. The JV has identified an initial customer location, and a CoronaLux L system is being shipped to China. Progress is also being made with respect to commercialization and business development in China, a market with tremendous upside potential given the current level of medical waste treatment needs and growing environmental regulations.  Patent filings in China have recently been successfully completed.   The system has been fully prepaid by the JV. Start-up and commissioning will take place during the fourth quarter.  Similar to PWS's arrangement with its UK partner, all costs and expenses associated with startup and operation of deployed units shall be borne by the PWS's partner in China.  Beyond the initial unit, a second system is also currently being prepared for deployment in China through the JV.   
United States
The CoronaLux Model L is performing well at the install site in southern California, with approximately 40,000 pounds of waste destroyed in the first six weeks under the operating restrictions of the conditional air permit in place. In-house sponsored stack testing conducted by an independent lab showed similar low emissions as previously recorded as part of the permitting process in Florida.
Paragon and its California partner have submitted all documentation required by South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) to begin the review for the final (unrestricted) permit that will facilitate a significant increase in waste processed at this facility.  Testing on the residue from the CoronaLux has been completed in California, resulting in the small amount (approximately 3% by weight) of residue being approved for ordinary disposal at nearby landfills.  A positive response from a second landfill is expected soon.  Plans are underway to provide additional systems to our California partner for deployment in both Southern and Northern California following approval from SCAQMD of the pending unrestricted operating permit.
Due to the documented successful results achieved by the Paragon system in its first deployment, the California Department of Public Health has identified Paragon's California partner as the only California waste treatment facility that is approved to treat all types of medical waste, including pharmaceutical waste which no other facility can treat within that state.   
Regulatory and permit work is underway in several other states including Texas, Massachusetts and New York. PWS is receiving numerous inquiries from entities representing diverse market applications throughout the United States and other countries. 
Progress in introducing the CoronaLux technology in the Florida market has been challenging due to certain logistical considerations at both the Pompano and Palm Beach facilities completely unrelated to the technology. The company is currently exploring options to better leverage and utilize the progress made to date and monetize the valuable permitting issued by Broward County and the State of Florida, Department of Health. 
"While progress has not come easy as is expected when introducing a disruptive technology into a highly regulated industry, we are pleased with the completed permitting in Florida and the positive developments in California, China and the UK.  In an industry that has not seen any new significant destruction technology in decades, our progress has been achieved in just 10 months following the issuance of the underlying patent for the CoronaLux technology," said J. John Combs, Chairman and CEO of SEER.  "We see the challenges in regulatory approval and regional business development as an expected part of our entry into very large and growing world-wide markets. As these formidable barriers to entry are overcome, we believe these successes will provide a very profitable and sustainable opportunity for PWS, and consequently, increased value for all SEER shareholders," concluded Combs.
According to "Medical Waste Management Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2013 - 2019", a new research report by Transparency Market Research, the global medical waste management market, worth US$14.5 billion in 2012, is estimated to reach US$20.1 billion by the end of 2019 registering growth at a CAGR of 4.8%.

Reports 2014 First Quarter Financial ResultsMarketwiredMay 15, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareGOLDEN, CO--(Marketwired - May 15, 2014) -  Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc. (SEER) (  PINKSHEETS :  SENR ), a provider of next-generation clean technologies, renewable fuel and waste management innovations, today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2014.First quarter revenue increased 8% to $2.8 million from revenue of $2.6 million in the first quarter last year. Services revenue grew 36% year over year to $2.3 million from $1.7 million, more than offsetting a decrease in product revenue from $0.9 million to $0.5 million for the comparative first quarters. Services revenue includes industrial and rail car cleaning services performed by the Company's REGS and Tactical Cleaning subsidiaries, both of which carried growth momentum from 2013 into the first quarter of 2014. Product revenue, which is comprised of air quality, fugitive emissions and renewable fuel solutions provided by the Company's MV Technologies subsidiary, declined primarily due to timing issues involving project revenue recognition. MV is, however, expected to show solid growth in 2014 over 2013. Paragon Waste Solutions continues to win new business and is expected to begin contributing more significantly to revenue as its CoronaLux™ systems are placed into service later this year.SEER continued to implement its aggressive growth initiatives during the first quarter and, as a result, total operating expenses increased to $3.9 million from $2.8 million year over year. Of the $1.1 million increase, $700,000 was attributable to non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The remaining increase was primarily due to increased staffing at the executive level to support current and future growth and also to costs associated with the commercial implementation of Paragon's waste destruction technology.As a result of increased expenses, 64% of which were non-cash, SEER reported a net loss attributable to SEER common stockholders of $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share, versus a net loss of $0.2 million, or less than $0.01 per share, in the first quarter last year. Modified EBITDA for the first quarter was a loss of $305,100."We are pleased the Company has continued its growth momentum into the first quarter," said J. John Combs III, chairman and CEO. "Despite exceptionally cold weather that reduced activity at several operating locations, our environmental and industrial services businesses performed very well, growing revenue by 36%. This growth more than offset lower product revenue from our MV Technologies division. We saw this coming since MV uses a project revenue recognition model based on percent of completion accounting and revenue can vary on a quarter-to-quarter basis independent of new orders and cash received. In the first quarter, we attended several industry conferences and saw increased interest in MV's products for odor control, fugitive emissions management and renewable fuels so we are confident this level of activity, combined with MV's existing project pipeline, will position the business for solid full-year revenue growth in 2014."We are also pleased that SEER's Paragon Waste Solutions business continued to secure prepaid customer commitments for its CoronaLux™ waste destruction systems," Combs added. "In the first quarter, approximately $436,000 of cash from these customers was received but deferred and will be amortized under our accounting practices. SEER invested approximately $0.7 million in the manufacture of CoronaLux™ systems during the first quarter and now has a total of five units either deployed or in transit for installation in the medical waste and oil and gas refining markets. As of March 31, 2014, Paragon secured customer commitments totaling approximately $1.0 million in up-front license fees and in the third quarter of 2014 expects to begin receiving on-going revenue-split royalties or monthly licensing payments from units already placed. Accordingly, we expect Paragon to contribute to revenue and overall profitability in 2014 and beyond."About Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc.Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc. (SEER) identifies, secures, and commercializes patented and proprietary environmental clean technologies in several multibillion dollar sectors (including oil & gas, renewable fuels, and all types of waste management, both solid and gaseous) for the purpose of either destroying/minimizing hazardous waste streams more safely and at lower cost than any competitive alternative, and/or processing the waste for use as a renewable fuel for the benefit of the customers and the environment. SEER has three wholly-owned operating subsidiaries: REGS, LLC; Tactical Cleaning Company, LLC; MV Technologies, LLC; and two majority-owned subsidiaries: Paragon Waste Solutions, LLC; and ReaCH4biogas ("Reach").Read MoreFor more information about the Company visit: www.seer-corp.comSafe Harbor StatementThis press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of various provisions of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, commonly identified by such terms as "believes," "looking ahead," "anticipates," "estimates," and other terms with similar meaning. Specifically, statements about demand for, and effectiveness of, the Company's products and services, and expectations for revenue growth and profitability are forward looking statements. Although the company believes that the assumptions upon which its forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these assumptions will prove to be correct.
