and �LTIP Units.� The General Partner is hereby authorized to cause the Partnership to issue additional Partnership
Interests, in the form of Partnership Units, for any Partnership purpose at any time or from time to time to the Partners (including
the General Partner) or to other Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall be established by the
General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion, all without the approval of any Limited Partners. The General Partner�s
determination that consideration is adequate shall be conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration relates to whether the
Partnership Units are validly issued and fully paid. Any additional Partnership Units issued thereby may be issued in one or more
classes, or one or more series of any of such classes, with such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional
or other special rights, powers and duties, including rights, powers and duties senior to the then-outstanding Partnership Units
held by the Limited Partners, all as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion and without
the approval of any Limited Partner, subject to Delaware law, including, without limitation, (i)�the allocations of items
of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and credit to each such class or series of Partnership Units; (ii)�the right
of each such class or series of Partnership Units to share in Partnership distributions; and (iii)�the rights of each such
class or series of Partnership Units upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; provided, however, that no additional
Partnership Units shall be issued to the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner)
unless:
�
(1) (A)�the additional
Partnership Units are issued in connection with an issuance of REIT Common Shares of or other interests in the General Partner,
which shares or interests have designations, preferences and other rights, all such that the economic interests are substantially
similar to the designations, preferences and other rights of the additional Partnership Units issued to the General Partner (or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) by the Partnership in accordance with this Section�4.02
and (B)�the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) shall make a Capital
Contribution to the Partnership in an amount equal to the cash consideration received by the General Partner from the issuance
of such REIT Common Shares or other interests in the General Partner;
�
(2) (A)�the additional
Partnership Units are issued in connection with an issuance of REIT Common Shares of or other interests in the General Partner
pursuant to a taxable share dividend declared by the General Partner, which shares or interests have designations, preferences
and other rights, all such that the economic interests are substantially similar to the designations, preferences and other rights
of the additional Partnership Units issued to the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General
Partner) by the Partnership in accordance with this Section�4.02, (B)�if the General Partner allows the holders of its
REIT Common Shares to elect whether to receive such dividend in REIT Common Shares, other interests of the General Partner or cash,
the Partnership will give the Limited Partners (excluding the General Partner or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the General
Partner) the same election to elect to receive (I) Partnership Units or cash or, (II)�at the election of the General Partner,
REIT Common Shares or cash, and (C)�if the Partnership issues additional Partnership Units pursuant to this Section�4.02(a)(i)(2),
then an amount of income equal to the value of the Partnership Units received will be allocated to those holders of Common Units
that elect to receive additional Partnership Units;
�

�14
�
�
(3) the additional
Partnership Units are issued in exchange for property owned by the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of the General Partner) with a fair market value, as determined by the General Partner, in good faith, equal to the value of the
Partnership Units; or
�
(4) Common Units are
issued to all Partners owning Common Units or LTIP Units in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests.
�
Without limiting the foregoing, the General
Partner is expressly authorized to cause the Partnership to issue Partnership Units for less than fair market value, so long as
the General Partner concludes in good faith that such issuance is in the best interests of the General Partner and the Partnership.
�
(ii) Upon Issuance
of Additional Securities. The General Partner shall not issue any additional REIT Common Shares (other than (i) REIT Common
Shares issued in connection with an exchange pursuant to Section�8.04, (ii) REIT Common Shares issued upon a conversion in
accordance with Section 5.4 of the Charter, (iii) REIT Common Shares issued in a taxable share dividend as described in Section
4.02(a)(i)(2)), or (iv) Rights (collectively, �Additional Securities�) other than to all holders of REIT Common
Shares, unless (A)�the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to issue to the General Partner (or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) Partnership Units or Rights having designations, preferences and other rights,
all such that the economic interests are substantially similar to those of the Additional Securities, and (B)�the General
Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) contributes the proceeds from the issuance of
such Additional Securities and from any exercise of Rights contained in such Additional Securities to the Partnership; provided,
however, that the General Partner is allowed to issue Additional Securities in connection with an acquisition of Property to be
held directly by the General Partner, but if and only if, such direct acquisition and issuance of Additional Securities have been
approved by a majority of the Independent Directors. Without limiting the foregoing, the General Partner is expressly authorized
to issue Additional Securities for less than fair market value, and the General Partner is authorized to cause the Partnership
to issue to the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) corresponding Partnership
Units, so long as (x)�the General Partner concludes in good faith that such issuance is in the best interests of the General
Partner and the Partnership and (y)�the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General
Partner) contributes all proceeds from such issuance to the Partnership, including without limitation, the issuance of REIT Common
Shares and corresponding Partnership Units pursuant to a share purchase plan providing for purchases of REIT Common Shares at a
discount from fair market value or pursuant to share awards, including share options that have an exercise price that is less than
the fair market value of the REIT Common Shares, either at the time of issuance or at the time of exercise, and restricted
or other share awards approved by the Board of Directors. For example, in the event the General Partner issues REIT Common Shares
for a cash purchase price and the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) contributes
all of the proceeds of such issuance to the Partnership as required hereunder, the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) shall be issued a number of additional Partnership Units equal to the product of (A)�the
number of such REIT Common Shares issued by the General Partner, the proceeds of which were so contributed, multiplied by (B) a
fraction, the numerator of which is 100%, and the denominator of which is the Conversion Factor in effect on the date of such contribution.
�

�15
�
�
(b)�����������Certain
Contributions of Proceeds of Issuance of REIT Common Shares. In connection with any and all issuances of REIT Common Shares,
the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) shall make Capital Contributions
to the Partnership of the proceeds therefrom, provided that if the proceeds actually received and contributed by the General Partner
(or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) are less than the gross proceeds of such issuance as
a result of any underwriter�s discount, commissions, placement fees or other expenses paid or incurred in connection with
such issuance, then the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) shall be deemed
to have made a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in the amount equal to the sum of the net proceeds of such issuance plus
the amount of such underwriter�s discount, commissions, placement fees or other expenses paid by the General Partner and
the Partnership shall be deemed simultaneously to have reimbursed such discount, commissions, placement fees and expenses as an
Administrative Expense for the benefit of the Partnership for purposes of Section�6.05(b)).
�
(c)�����������Repurchases
of General Partner Securities. If the General Partner shall repurchase shares of any class of its shares of beneficial
interest, all costs incurred in connection with such repurchase shall be reimbursed to the General Partner by the Partnership pursuant
to Section�6.05 and the General Partner simultaneously shall cause the Partnership to redeem an equivalent number of Partnership
Units of the appropriate class or series held by the General Partner, or by the General Partner in its capacity as a Limited Partner,
(which, in the case of REIT Common Shares, shall be a number equal to the quotient of the number of such REIT Common Shares divided
by the Conversion Factor).
�
4.03��������Additional
Funding. If the General Partner determines that it is in the best interests of the Partnership to provide for additional
Partnership funds (�Additional Funds�) for any Partnership purpose, the General Partner may (i)�cause
the Partnership to obtain such funds from outside borrowings, or (ii)�elect to have the General Partner or any of its Affiliates
provide such Additional Funds to the Partnership through loans or otherwise.
�

�16
�
�
4.04��������LTIP
Units.
�
(a)�����������Issuance
of LTIP Units. The General Partner may from time to time cause the Partnership to issue LTIP Units to Persons who provide services
to the Partnership or the General Partner, for such consideration as the General Partner may determine to be appropriate, and admit
such Persons as Limited Partners. Subject to the following provisions of this Section�4.04 and the special provisions of Sections�4.05
and 5.01(g), LTIP Units shall be treated as Common Units, with all of the rights, privileges and obligations attendant thereto.
For purposes of computing the Partners� Percentage Interests, holders of LTIP Units shall be treated as Common Unit holders
and LTIP Units shall be treated as Common Units. In particular, the Partnership shall maintain at all times a one-to-one correspondence
between LTIP Units and Common Units for conversion, distribution and other purposes, including, without limitation, complying with
the following procedures:
�
(i)�If an Adjustment
Event occurs, then the General Partner shall make a corresponding adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain a one-for-one conversion
and economic equivalence ratio between Common Units and LTIP Units. The following shall be �Adjustment Events�:
(A)�the Partnership makes a distribution on all outstanding Common Units in Partnership Units, (B)�the Partnership subdivides
the outstanding Common Units into a greater number of units or combines the outstanding Common Units into a smaller number of units,
or (C)�the Partnership issues any Partnership Units in exchange for its outstanding Common Units by way of a reclassification
or recapitalization of its Common Units. If more than one Adjustment Event occurs, the adjustment to the LTIP Units need be made
only once using a single formula that takes into account each and every Adjustment Event as if all Adjustment Events occurred simultaneously.
For the avoidance of doubt, the following shall not be Adjustment Events: (x)�the issuance of Partnership Units in a financing,
reorganization, acquisition or other similar business Common Unit Transaction, (y)�the issuance of Partnership Units pursuant
to any employee benefit or compensation plan or distribution reinvestment plan or (z)�the issuance of any Partnership Units
to the General Partner in respect of a capital contribution to the Partnership of proceeds from the sale of Additional Securities
by the General Partner. If the Partnership takes an action affecting the Common Units other than actions specifically described
above as �Adjustment Events� and in the opinion of the General Partner such action would require an adjustment to the
LTIP Units to maintain the one-to-one correspondence described above, the General Partner shall have the right to make such adjustment
to the LTIP Units, to the extent permitted by law and by any Equity Incentive Plan, in such manner and at such time as the General
Partner, in its sole discretion, may determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. If an adjustment is made to the LTIP
Units, as herein provided, the Partnership shall promptly file in the books and records of the Partnership an officer�s certificate
setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment, which certificate shall be conclusive
evidence of the correctness of such adjustment absent manifest error. Promptly after filing of such certificate, the Partnership
shall mail a notice to each LTIP Unitholder setting forth the adjustment to his or her LTIP Units and the effective date of such
adjustment; and
�
(ii) The LTIP Unitholders
shall, when, as and if authorized and declared by the General Partner out of assets legally available for that purpose, be entitled
to receive distributions in an amount per LTIP Unit equal to the distributions per Common Unit (the �Common Partnership
Unit Distribution�), paid to holders of Common Units on such Partnership Record Date established by the General Partner
with respect to such distribution. So long as any LTIP Units are outstanding, no distributions (whether in cash or in kind) shall
be authorized, declared or paid on Common Units, unless equal distributions have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared
and paid on the LTIP Units.
�

�17
�
�
(b)����������Priority.
Subject to the provisions of this Section�4.04 and the special provisions of Sections�4.05 and 5.01(g), the LTIP Units
shall rank pari passu with the Common Units as to the payment of regular and special periodic or other distributions and
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As to the payment of distributions and as to distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, any class or series of Partnership Units which by its terms specifies that
it shall rank junior to, on a parity with, or senior to the Common Units shall also rank junior to, or pari passu with,
or senior to, as the case may be, the LTIP Units. Subject to the terms of any Vesting Agreement, an LTIP Unitholder shall be entitled
to transfer his or her LTIP Units to the same extent, and subject to the same restrictions as holders of Common Units are entitled
to transfer their Common Units pursuant to Article�IX.
�
(c)����������Special
Provisions. LTIP Units shall be subject to the following special provisions:
�
(i) Vesting Agreements.
LTIP Units may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, be issued subject to vesting, forfeiture and additional restrictions
on transfer pursuant to the terms of a Vesting Agreement. The terms of any Vesting Agreement may be modified by the General Partner
from time to time in its sole discretion, subject to any restrictions on amendment imposed by the relevant Vesting Agreement or
by the Equity Incentive Plan, if applicable. LTIP Units that have vested under the terms of a Vesting Agreement are referred to
as �Vested LTIP Units�; all other LTIP Units shall be treated as �Unvested LTIP Units.�
�
(ii) Forfeiture.
Unless otherwise specified in the Vesting Agreement, upon the occurrence of any event specified in a Vesting Agreement as resulting
in either the right of the Partnership or the General Partner to repurchase LTIP Units at a specified purchase price or some other
forfeiture of any LTIP Units, then if the Partnership or the General Partner exercises such right to repurchase or forfeiture in
accordance with the applicable Vesting Agreement, the relevant LTIP Units shall immediately, and without any further action, be
treated as cancelled and no longer outstanding for any purpose. Unless otherwise specified in the Vesting Agreement, no consideration
or other payment shall be due with respect to any LTIP Units that have been forfeited, other than any distributions declared with
respect to a Partnership Record Date before the effective date of the forfeiture. In connection with any repurchase or forfeiture
of LTIP Units, the balance of the portion of the Capital Account of the LTIP Unitholder that is attributable to all of his or her
LTIP Units shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which it exceeds the target balance contemplated by Section�5.01(g),
calculated with respect to the LTIP Unitholder�s remaining LTIP Units, if any.
�
(iii)�Allocations.
LTIP Unitholders shall be entitled to certain special allocations of gain under Section�5.01(g).
�

�18
�
�
(iv)�Redemption.
The Common Unit Redemption Right provided to Limited Partners under Section�8.04 shall not apply with respect to LTIP Units
unless and until they are converted to Common Units as provided in Section 4.04(c)(v)� and Section�4.05.
�
(v)�Conversion
to Common Units. Vested LTIP Units are eligible to be converted into Common Units in accordance with Section�4.05.
�
(d)�����������Voting.
LTIP Unitholders shall (a)�have the same voting rights as the Limited Partners, with the LTIP Units voting as a single class
with the Common Units and having one vote per LTIP Unit; and (b)�have the additional voting rights that are expressly set
forth below. So long as any LTIP Units remain outstanding, the Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the LTIP Units outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting
separately as a class), amend, alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, the provisions of this Agreement
applicable to LTIP Units so as to materially and adversely affect any right, privilege or voting power of the LTIP Units or the
LTIP Unitholders as such, unless such amendment, alteration, or repeal affects equally, ratably and proportionately the rights,
privileges and voting powers of the Limited Partners; but subject, in any event, to the following provisions:
�
(i) With respect to any
Common Unit Transaction (as defined in Section�4.05(f)), so long as the LTIP Units are treated in accordance with Section�4.05(f),
the consummation of such Common Unit Transaction shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences,
privileges or voting powers of the LTIP Units or the LTIP Unitholders as such; and
�
(ii) Any creation or
issuance of any Partnership Units or of any class or series of Partnership Interest including without limitation additional Common
Units or LTIP Units, whether ranking senior to, junior to, or on a parity with the LTIP Units with respect to distributions and
the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect
such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the LTIP Units or the LTIP Unitholders as such.
�
The foregoing voting
provisions will not apply if, at or before the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required will
be effected, all outstanding LTIP Units shall have been converted into Common Units.
�
4.05��������Conversion
of LTIP Units.
�
(a)�����������Subject
to the provisions of this section, an LTIP Unitholder shall have the right (the �Conversion Right�), at his
or her option, at any time to convert all or a portion of his or her Vested LTIP Units into Common Units; provided, however, that
a holder may not exercise the Conversion Right for less than one thousand (1,000) Vested LTIP Units or, if such holder holds less
than one thousand Vested LTIP Units, all of the Vested LTIP Units held by such holder. LTIP Unitholders shall not have the right
to convert Unvested LTIP Units into Common Units until they become Vested LTIP Units; provided, however, that when an LTIP Unitholder
is notified of the expected occurrence of an event that will cause his or her Unvested LTIP Units to become Vested LTIP Units,
such LTIP Unitholder may give the Partnership a Conversion Notice conditioned upon and effective as of the time of vesting and
such Conversion Notice, unless subsequently revoked by the LTIP Unitholder, shall be accepted by the Partnership subject to such
condition. The General Partner shall have the right at any time to cause a conversion of Vested LTIP Units into Common Units. In
all cases, the conversion of any LTIP Units into Common Units shall be subject to the conditions and procedures set forth in this
Section�4.05.
�

�19
�
�
(b)����������A
holder of Vested LTIP Units may convert such LTIP Units into an equal number of fully paid and non-assessable Common Units, giving
effect to all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to Section�4.04. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may a holder
of Vested LTIP Units convert a number of Vested LTIP Units that exceeds (x)�the Economic Capital Account Balance of such Limited
Partner, to the extent attributable to its ownership of LTIP Units, divided by (y)�the Common Unit Economic Balance, in each
case as determined as of the effective date of conversion (the �Capital Account Limitation�). To exercise such
LTIP Unitholder�s Conversion Right, an LTIP Unitholder shall deliver a notice (a �Conversion Notice�)
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit�D to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) not less than
ten nor more than 60�days before a date (the �Conversion Date�) specified in such Conversion Notice; provided,
however, that if the General Partner has not given to the LTIP Unitholders notice of a proposed or upcoming Common Unit Transaction
(as defined in Section�4.05(f)) at least 30�days before the effective date of such Common Unit Transaction, then LTIP
Unitholders shall have the right to deliver a Conversion Notice until the earlier of (x)�the tenth day after such notice from
the General Partner of a Common Unit Transaction or (y)�the third business day immediately preceding the effective date of
such Common Unit Transaction. A Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner provided in Section�12.01. Each LTIP Unitholder
covenants and agrees that all Vested LTIP Units to be converted pursuant to this Section�4.05(b) shall be free and clear of
all liens. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a holder of LTIP Units may deliver a Notice of Redemption pursuant
to Section�8.04(a) relating to those Common Units that will be issued to such holder upon conversion of such LTIP Units into
Common Units in advance of the Conversion Date; provided, however, that the redemption of such Common Units by the
Partnership shall in no event take place until after the Conversion Date. For clarity, it is noted that the objective of this paragraph
is to put an LTIP Unitholder in a position where, if such LTIP Unitholder so wishes, the Common Units into which such LTIP Unitholder�s
Vested LTIP Units will be converted can be redeemed by the Partnership simultaneously with such conversion, with the further consequence
that, if the General Partner elects to assume the Partnership�s redemption obligation with respect to such Common Units under
Section�8.04(b) by delivering to such holder REIT Common Shares rather than cash, then such holder can have such REIT Common
Shares issued to him or her simultaneously with the conversion of his or her Vested LTIP Units into Common Units. The General Partner
and LTIP Unitholder shall reasonably cooperate with each other to coordinate the timing of the events described in the foregoing
sentence.
�
(c)����������The
Partnership, at any time at the election of the General Partner, may cause any number of Vested LTIP Units held by an LTIP Unitholder
to be converted (a �Forced Conversion�) into an equal number of Common Units, giving effect to all adjustments
(if any) made pursuant to Section 4.04; provided, however, that the Partnership may not cause Forced Conversion of any LTIP Units
that would not at the time be eligible for conversion at the option of such LTIP Unitholder pursuant to Section�4.05(b). To
exercise its right of Forced Conversion, the Partnership shall deliver a notice (a �Forced Conversion Notice�)
in the form attached as Exhibit�E to the applicable LTIP Unitholder not less than ten nor more than 60 days before
the Conversion Date specified in such Forced Conversion Notice. A Forced Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner provided
in Section�12.01.
�

�20
�
�
(d)����������A
conversion of Vested LTIP Units for which the LTIP Unitholder has given a Conversion Notice or the Partnership has given a Forced
Conversion Notice shall occur automatically after the close of business on the applicable Conversion Date without any action on
the part of such LTIP Unitholder, as of which time such LTIP Unitholder shall be credited on the books and records of the Partnership
with the issuance as of the opening of business on the next day of the number of Common Units issuable upon such conversion. After
the conversion of LTIP Units as aforesaid, the Partnership shall deliver to such LTIP Unitholder, upon his or her written request,
a certificate of the General Partner certifying the number of Common Units and remaining LTIP Units, if any, held by such person
immediately after such conversion. The Assignee of any Limited Partner pursuant to Article�IX may exercise the rights of such
Limited Partner pursuant to this Section�4.05 and such Limited Partner shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by the
Assignee.
�
(e)����������For
purposes of making future allocations under Section�5.01(g) and applying the Capital Account Limitation, the portion of the
Economic Capital Account Balance of the applicable LTIP Unitholder that is treated as attributable to his or her LTIP Units shall
be reduced, as of the date of conversion, by the product of the number of LTIP Units converted and the Common Unit Economic Balance.
�
(f)����������If
the Partnership or the General Partner shall be a party to any Common Unit Transaction (including without limitation a merger,
consolidation, unit exchange, self-tender offer for all or substantially all Common Units or other business combination or reorganization,
or sale of all or substantially all of the Partnership�s assets, but excluding any Common Unit Transaction which constitutes
an Adjustment Event) in each case as a result of which Common Units shall be exchanged for or converted into the right, or the
holders of such Units shall otherwise be entitled, to receive cash, securities or other property or any combination thereof (each
of the foregoing being referred to herein as a �Common Unit Transaction�), then the General Partner shall, immediately
before the Common Unit Transaction, exercise its right to cause a Forced Conversion with respect to the maximum number of LTIP
Units then eligible for conversion, taking into account any allocations that occur in connection with the Common Unit Transaction
or that would occur in connection with the Common Unit Transaction if the assets of the Partnership were sold at the Common Unit
Transaction price or, if applicable, at a value determined by the General Partner in good faith using the value attributed to the
Partnership Units in the context of the Common Unit Transaction (in which case the Conversion Date shall be the effective date
of the Common Unit Transaction).
�

�21
�
�
In anticipation of
such Forced Conversion and the consummation of the Common Unit Transaction, the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each LTIP Unitholder to be afforded the right to receive in connection with such Common Unit Transaction in consideration
for the Common Units into which such LTIP Units will be converted the same kind and amount of cash, securities and other property
(or any combination thereof) receivable upon the consummation of such Common Unit Transaction by a holder of the same number of
Common Units, assuming such holder of Common Units is not a Person with which the Partnership consolidated or into which the Partnership
merged or which merged into the Partnership or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (a �Constituent
Person�), or an affiliate of a Constituent Person. In the event that holders of Common Units have the opportunity to
elect the form or type of consideration to be received upon consummation of the Common Unit Transaction, before such Common Unit
Transaction the General Partner shall give prompt written notice to each LTIP Unitholder of such election, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to afford the LTIP Unitholders the right to elect, by written notice to the General Partner, the form or type
of consideration to be received upon conversion of each LTIP Unit held by such holder into Common Units in connection with such
Common Unit Transaction. If an LTIP Unitholder fails to make such an election, such holder (and any of its transferees) shall receive
upon conversion of each LTIP Unit held him or her (or by any of his or her transferees) the same kind and amount of consideration
that a holder of a Common Unit would receive if such Common Unit holder failed to make such an election.
�
Subject to the rights
of the Partnership and the General Partner under any Vesting Agreement and any Equity Incentive Plan, the Partnership shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the terms of any Common Unit Transaction to be consistent with the provisions of this
Section�4.05(f) and to enter into an agreement with the successor or purchasing entity, as the case may be, for the benefit
of any LTIP Unitholders whose LTIP Units will not be converted into Common Units in connection with the Common Unit Transaction
that will (i)�contain provisions enabling the holders of LTIP Units that remain outstanding after such Common Unit Transaction
to convert their LTIP Units into securities as comparable as reasonably possible under the circumstances to the Common Units and
(ii)�preserve as far as reasonably possible under the circumstances the distribution, special allocation, conversion, and
other rights set forth in this Agreement for the benefit of the LTIP Unitholders.
�
4.06���������Capital
Accounts. A separate capital account (a �Capital Account�) shall be established and maintained
for each Partner in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). If (i)�a new or existing Partner acquires an additional
Partnership Interest in exchange for more than a de minimis Capital Contribution, (ii)�the Partnership distributes
to a Partner more than a de minimis amount of Partnership property as consideration for a Partnership Interest, (iii)�the
Partnership is liquidated within the meaning of Regulation�Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) or (iv)�the Partnership
grants a Partnership Interest (other than a de minimis Partnership Interest) as consideration for the provision of services
to or for the benefit of the Partnership to an existing Partner acting in a Partner capacity, or to a new Partner acting in a Partner
capacity or in anticipation of being a Partner, the General Partner shall revalue the property of the Partnership to its fair market
value (as determined by the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, and taking into account Section 7701(g) of the
Code) in accordance with Regulations Section�1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f); provided, that (i) the issuance of any LTIP Unit
shall be deemed to require a revaluation pursuant to this Section�4.06 and (ii) the General Partner may elect not to revalue
the property of the Partnership in connection with the issuance of additional Partnership Units pursuant to Section 4.02 to the
extent it determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that revaluing the property of the Partnership is not necessary or appropriate
to reflect the relative economic interests of the Partners. When the Partnership�s property is revalued by the General Partner,
the Capital Accounts of the Partners shall be adjusted in accordance with Regulations Sections�1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)
and (g), which generally require such Capital Accounts to be adjusted to reflect the manner in which the unrealized gain
or loss inherent in such property (that has not been reflected in the Capital Accounts previously) would be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to Section�5.01 if there were a taxable disposition of such property for its fair market value (as determined
by the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, and taking into account Section 7701(g) of the Code) on the date of
the revaluation.
�

�22
�
�
4.07���������Percentage
Interests. If the number of outstanding Common Units or LTIP Units increases or decreases during a taxable year, each Partner�s
Percentage Interest shall be adjusted by the General Partner effective as of the effective date of each such increase or decrease
to a percentage equal to the number of Common Units or LTIP Units held by such Partner divided by the aggregate number of Common
Units and LTIP Units, as applicable, outstanding after giving effect to such increase or decrease. If the Partners� Percentage
Interests are adjusted pursuant to this Section�4.07, the Profits and Losses for the taxable year in which the adjustment
occurs shall be allocated between the part of the year ending on the day when the Partnership�s property is revalued by the
General Partner and the part of the year beginning on the following day either (i) as if the taxable year had ended on the date
of the adjustment or (ii)�based on the number of days in each part. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion,
shall determine which method shall be used to allocate Profits and Losses for the taxable year in which the adjustment occurs.
The allocation of Profits and Losses for the earlier part of the year shall be based on the Percentage Interests before adjustment,
and the allocation of Profits and Losses for the later part shall be based on the adjusted Percentage Interests.
�
4.08���������No
Interest on Contributions. No Partner shall be entitled to interest on its Capital Contribution.
�
4.09���������Return
of Capital Contributions. No Partner shall be entitled to withdraw any part of its Capital Contribution or its Capital
Account or to receive any distribution from the Partnership, except as specifically provided in this Agreement. Except as otherwise
provided herein, there shall be no obligation to return to any Partner or withdrawn Partner any part of such Partner�s Capital
Contribution for so long as the Partnership continues in existence.
�
4.10���������No
Third-Party Beneficiary. No creditor or other third party having dealings with the Partnership shall have the right
to enforce the right or obligation of any Partner to make Capital Contributions or loans or to pursue any other right or remedy
hereunder or at law or in equity, it being understood and agreed that the provisions of this Agreement shall be solely for the
benefit of, and may be enforced solely by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. None of the rights or
obligations of the Partners herein set forth to make Capital Contributions or loans to the Partnership shall be deemed an asset
of the Partnership for any purpose by any creditor or other third party, nor may such rights or obligations be sold, transferred
or assigned by the Partnership or pledged or encumbered by the Partnership to secure any debt or other obligation of the Partnership
or of any of the Partners. In addition, it is the intent of the parties hereto that no distribution to any Limited Partner shall
be deemed a return of money or other property in violation of the Act. However, if any court of competent jurisdiction holds that,
notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, any Limited Partner is obligated to return such money or property, such obligation
shall be the obligation of such Limited Partner and not of the General Partner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
a deficit Capital Account of a Partner shall not be deemed to be a liability of such Partner nor an asset or property of the Partnership.

PROFITS AND LOSSES; DISTRIBUTIONS
�
5.01��������Allocation
of Profit and Loss.
�
(a)�����������Profit.
Profit of the Partnership for each fiscal year of the Partnership shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests.
�
(b)�����������Loss.
Loss of the Partnership for each fiscal year of the Partnership shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests.
�
(c)�����������Minimum
Gain Chargeback. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, (i)�any expense of the Partnership that is a �nonrecourse
deduction� within the meaning of Regulations Section�1.704-2(b)(1) shall be allocated in accordance with the Partners�
respective Percentage Interests, (ii)�any expense of the Partnership that is a �partner nonrecourse deduction�
within the meaning of Regulations Section�1.704-2(i)(2) shall be allocated to the Partner that bears the �economic risk
of loss� of such deduction in accordance with Regulations Section�1.704-2(i)(1), (iii)�if there is a net decrease
in Partnership Minimum Gain within the meaning of Regulations Section�1.704-2(f)(1) for any Partnership taxable year, then,
subject to the exceptions set forth in Regulations Section�1.704-2(f)(2),(3), (4)�and (5), items of gain and income shall
be allocated among the Partners in accordance with Regulations Section�1.704-2(f) and the ordering rules contained in Regulations
Section�1.704-2(j), and (iv)�if there is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain within the meaning of
Regulations Section�1.704-2(i)(4) for any Partnership taxable year, then, subject to the exceptions set forth in Regulations
Section�1.704(2)(g), items of gain and income shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance with Regulations Section�1.704-2(i)(4)
and the ordering rules contained in Regulations Section�1.704-2(j). The manner in which it is reasonably expected that the
deductions attributable to nonrecourse liabilities will be allocated for purposes of determining a Partner�s share of the
nonrecourse liabilities of the Partnership within the meaning of Regulations Section�1.752-3(a)(3) shall be in accordance
with a Partner�s Percentage Interest.
�
(d)�����������Qualified
Income Offset. If a Partner receives in any taxable year an adjustment, allocation or distribution described in subparagraphs
(4), (5)�or (6)�of Regulations Section�1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) that causes or increases
a deficit balance in such Partner�s Capital Account that exceeds the sum of such Partner�s shares of Partnership Minimum
Gain and Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain, as determined in accordance with Regulations Sections�1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i),
such Partner shall be allocated specially for such taxable year (and, if necessary, later taxable years) items of income and gain
in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate such deficit Capital Account balance as quickly as possible as provided in Regulations
Section�1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). After the occurrence of an allocation of income or gain to a Partner in accordance with
this Section�5.01(d), to the extent permitted by Regulations Section�1.704-1(b), items of expense or loss shall be allocated
to such Partner in an amount necessary to offset the income or gain previously allocated to such Partner under this Section�5.01(d).
�

�24
�
�
(e)�����������Capital
Account Deficits. Loss shall not be allocated to a Limited Partner to the extent that such allocation would cause a deficit
in such Partner�s Capital Account (after reduction to reflect the items described in Regulations Section�1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),
(5)�and (6)) to exceed the sum of such Partner�s shares of Partnership Minimum Gain and Partner Nonrecourse
Debt Minimum Gain. Any Loss in excess of that limitation shall be allocated to the General Partner. After the occurrence of an
allocation of Loss to the General Partner in accordance with this Section�5.01(e), to the extent permitted by Regulations
Section�1.704-1(b), Profit first shall be allocated to the General Partner in an amount necessary to offset the Loss previously
allocated to the General Partner under this Section�5.01(e).
�
(f)������������Allocations
Between Transferor and Transferee. If a Partner transfers any part or all of its Partnership Interest, the distributive shares
of the various items of Profit and Loss allocable among the Partners during such fiscal year of the Partnership shall be allocated
between the transferor and the transferee Partner either (i)�as if the Partnership�s fiscal year had ended on the date
of the transfer or (ii)�based on the number of days of such fiscal year that each was a Partner without regard to the results
of Partnership activities in the respective portions of such fiscal year in which the transferor and the transferee were Partners.
The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine which method shall be used to allocate the distributive
shares of the various items of Profit and Loss between the transferor and the transferee Partner.
�
(g)�����������Special
Allocations Regarding LTIP Units. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections�5.01(a) and (b), Liquidating Gains shall
first be allocated to the LTIP Unitholders until their Economic Capital Account Balances, to the extent attributable to their ownership
of LTIP Units, are equal to (i)�the Common Unit Economic Balance, multiplied by (ii)�the number of their LTIP Units.
For this purpose, �Liquidating Gains� means net capital gains realized in connection with the actual or hypothetical
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership, including but not limited to net capital gain realized in connection
with an adjustment to the value of Partnership assets under Section 704(b) of the Code. The �Economic Capital Account
Balances� of the LTIP Unitholders will be equal to their Capital Account balances to the extent attributable to their
ownership of LTIP Units. Similarly, the �Common Unit Economic Balance� shall mean (i)�the Capital Account
balance of the General Partner, plus the amount of the General Partner�s share of any Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain
or Partnership Minimum Gain, in either case to the extent attributable to the General Partner�s ownership of Common Units
and computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into account all allocations through the date on which any allocation is made
under this Section�5.01(g), divided by (ii)�the number of the General Partner�s Common Units. Any such allocations
shall be made among the LTIP Unitholders in proportion to the amounts required to be allocated to each under this Section�5.01(g).
The parties agree that the intent of this Section�5.01(g) is to make the Capital Account balance associated with each LTIP
Unit to be economically equivalent to the Capital Account balance associated with the General Partner�s Common Units (on
a per-Unit basis).
�

�25
�
�
(h)�����������Definition
of Profit and Loss. �Profit� and �Loss� and any items of income, gain, expense or loss
referred to in this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with federal income tax accounting principles, as modified by Regulations
Section�1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), except that Profit and Loss shall not include items of income, gain and expense that are specially
allocated pursuant to Sections�5.01(c), (d) or (e). All allocations of income, Profit, gain, Loss and expense (and all items
contained therein) for federal income tax purposes shall be identical to all allocations of such items set forth in this Section�5.01,
except as otherwise required by Section 704(c) of the Code and Regulations Section�1.704-1(b)(4). With respect to properties
acquired by the Partnership, the General Partner shall have the authority to elect the method to be used by the Partnership for
allocating items of income, gain and expense as required by Section�704(c) of the Code with respect to such properties, and
such election shall be binding on all Partners.
�
5.02��������Distribution
of Cash.
�
(a)�����������Subject
to Sections�5.02(c), (d)�and (e), the Partnership shall distribute cash at such times and in such amounts as are determined
by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion, to the Partners who are Partners on the Partnership Record Date with
respect to such quarter (or other distribution period) in proportion with their respective Percentage Interests on the Partnership
Record Date.
�
(b)�����������In
accordance with Section�4.04(a)(ii), the LTIP Unitholders shall be entitled to receive distributions in an amount per LTIP
Unit equal to the Common Partnership Unit Distribution.
�
(c)�����������If
a new or existing Partner acquires additional Partnership Units in exchange for a Capital Contribution on any date other than a
Partnership Record Date, the cash distribution attributable to such additional Partnership Units relating to the Partnership Record
Date next following the issuance of such additional Partnership Units shall be reduced in the proportion to (i)�the number
of days that such additional Partnership Units are held by such Partner bears to (ii)�the number of days between such Partnership
Record Date and the immediately preceding Partnership Record Date.
�

�26
�
�
(d)����������
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner is authorized to take any action that it determines
to be necessary or appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any withholding requirements established under the Code
or any other federal, state or local law including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections�1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of
the Code. To the extent that the Partnership is required to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any amount resulting
from the allocation or distribution of income to a Partner or assignee (including by reason of Section�1446 of the Code),
either (i)�if the actual amount to be distributed to the Partner (the �Distributable Amount�) equals or
exceeds the Withheld Amount, the entire Distributable Amount shall be treated as a distribution of cash to such Partner, or (ii)�if
the Distributable Amount is less than the Withheld Amount, the excess of the Withheld Amount over the Distributable Amount shall
be treated as a Partnership Loan from the Partnership to the Partner on the day the Partnership pays over such amount to a taxing
authority. A Partnership Loan shall be repaid upon the demand of the Partnership or, alternatively, through withholding by the
Partnership with respect to subsequent distributions to the applicable Partner or assignee. In the event that a Limited Partner
fails to pay any amount owed to the Partnership with respect to the Partnership Loan within 15�days after demand for payment
thereof is made by the Partnership on the Limited Partner, the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may elect
to make the payment to the Partnership on behalf of such Defaulting Limited Partner. In such event, on the date of payment, the
General Partner shall be deemed to have extended a General Partner Loan to the Defaulting Limited Partner in the amount of the
payment made by the General Partner and shall succeed to all rights and remedies of the Partnership against the Defaulting Limited
Partner as to that amount. Without limitation, the General Partner shall have the right to receive any distributions that otherwise
would be made by the Partnership to the Defaulting Limited Partner until such time as the General Partner Loan has been paid in
full, and any such distributions so received by the General Partner shall be treated as having been received by the Defaulting
Limited Partner and immediately paid to the General Partner.
�
Any amounts treated
as a Partnership Loan or a General Partner Loan pursuant to this Section�5.02(d) shall bear interest at the lesser of (i)�300
basis points above the base rate on corporate loans at large United States money center commercial banks, as published from time
to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, or (ii)�the maximum lawful rate of interest on such obligation,
such interest to accrue from the date the Partnership or the General Partner, as applicable, is deemed to extend the loan until
such loan is repaid in full.
�
(e)�����������
In no event may a Partner receive a distribution of cash with respect to a Partnership Unit if such Partner is entitled to receive
a cash dividend as the holder of record of a REIT Common Share for which all or part of such Partnership Unit has been or will
be redeemed.
�
5.03��������REIT
Distribution Requirements. The General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Partnership
to distribute amounts sufficient to enable the General Partner to pay distributions to its shareholders that will allow the General
Partner to (i)�meet its distribution requirement for qualification as a REIT as set forth in Section�857 of the Code
and (ii)�avoid any federal income or excise tax liability imposed by the Code, other than to the extent the General Partner
elects to retain and pay income tax on its net capital gain.
�
5.04��������No
Right to Distributions in Kind. No Partner shall be entitled to demand property other than cash in connection with
any distributions by the Partnership.
�
5.05��������Limitations
on Return of Capital Contributions. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Article�V, no Partner shall
have the right to receive, and the General Partner shall not have the right to make, a distribution that includes a return of
all or part of a Partner�s Capital Contributions, unless after giving effect to the return of a Capital Contribution, the
sum of all Partnership liabilities, other than the liabilities to a Partner for the return of his Capital Contribution, does not
exceed the fair market value of the Partnership�s assets.
�

�27
�
�
5.06��������Distributions
Upon Liquidation.
�
(a)�����������Upon
liquidation of the Partnership, after payment of, or adequate provision for, debts and obligations of the Partnership, including
any Partner loans, any remaining assets of the Partnership shall be distributed to all Partners with positive Capital Accounts
in accordance with their respective positive Capital Account balances.
�
(b)�����������For
purposes of Section�5.06(a), the Capital Account of each Partner shall be determined after all adjustments made in accordance
with Sections�5.01 and 5.02 resulting from Partnership operations and from all sales and dispositions of all or any part of
the Partnership�s assets.
�
(c)�����������Any
distributions pursuant to this Section�5.06 shall be made by the end of the Partnership�s taxable year in which the
liquidation occurs (or, if later, within 90�days after the date of the liquidation). To the extent deemed advisable by the
General Partner, appropriate arrangements (including the use of a liquidating trust) may be made to assure that adequate funds
are available to pay any contingent debts or obligations.
�
5.07��������Substantial
Economic Effect. It is the intent of the Partners that the allocations of Profit and Loss under the Agreement have
substantial economic effect (or be consistent with the Partners� interests in the Partnership in the case of the allocation
of losses attributable to nonrecourse debt) within the meaning of Section 704(b) of the Code as interpreted by the Regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto. Article�V and other relevant provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner
consistent with such intent.

or obligation on behalf of the Partnership.
�
6.02��������Delegation

�
6.03��������Indemnification
and Exculpation of Indemnitees.
�
(a)�����������The
Partnership shall indemnify an Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several,
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts arising from any and
all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations
of the Partnership as set forth in this Agreement in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as
a party or otherwise, unless it is established that: (i)�the act or omission of the Indemnitee was material to the matter
giving rise to the proceeding and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; (ii)�the
Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or (iii)�in the case of any criminal
proceeding, the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding
by judgment, order or settlement does not create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct
set forth in this Section�6.03(a). The termination of any proceeding by conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
its equivalent, or an entry of an order of probation before judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that the Indemnitee acted
in a manner contrary to that specified in this Section�6.03(a). Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be
made only out of the assets of the Partnership.
�

�31
�
�
(b)����������The
Partnership shall reimburse an Indemnitee for reasonable expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a proceeding in advance
of the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of (i)�a written affirmation by the Indemnitee
of the Indemnitee�s good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Partnership as authorized
in this Section�6.03 has been met, and (ii)�a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amount
if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met.
�
(c)����������The
indemnification provided by this Section�6.03 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other
Person may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue
as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity.
�
(d)����������The
Partnership may purchase and maintain insurance, as an expense of the Partnership, on behalf of the Indemnitees and such other
Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that may be incurred
by such Person in connection with the Partnership�s activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power
to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.
�
(e)����������For
purposes of this Section�6.03, the Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an
employee benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves
services by, it to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to
an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute fines within the meaning of this Section�6.03; and actions
taken or omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably
believed by it to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose that
is not opposed to the best interests of the Partnership.
�
(f)����������In
no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth
in this Agreement.
�
(g)���������An
Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section�6.03 because the Indemnitee had an interest
in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of
this Agreement.
�
(h)���������The
provisions of this Section�6.03 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators
and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.
�

�32
�
�
(i)�����������Any
amendment, modification or repeal of this Section�6.03 or any provision shall be prospective only and shall not in any way
affect the indemnification of an Indemnitee by the Partnership under this Section�6.03 as in effect immediately before such
amendment, modification or repeal with respect to matters occurring, in whole or in part, before such amendment, modification or
repeal, regardless of when claims relating to such matters may arise or be asserted.
�
6.04��������Liability
of the General Partner.
�
(a)����������Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither the General Partner, nor any of its Directors, officers, agents or
employees shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership or any Partners for losses sustained or liabilities incurred
as a result of errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or omission if any such party acted in good faith. The
General Partner shall not be in breach of any duty that the General Partner may owe to the Limited Partners or the Partnership
or any other Persons under this Agreement or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity provided the General Partner, acting
in good faith, abides by the terms of this Agreement.
�
(b)����������The
Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General Partner is acting on behalf of the Partnership and the General Partner�s
shareholders collectively, that the General Partner is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the Limited Partners
(including, without limitation, the tax consequences to Limited Partners or the tax consequences of some, but not all, of the Limited
Partners) in deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or decline to take) any actions. In the event of a conflict between
the interests of the shareholders of the General Partner on the one hand and the Limited Partners on the other, the General Partner
shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the conflict in a manner not adverse to either the shareholders of the General Partner
or the Limited Partners; provided, however, that any such conflict that the General Partner, in its sole and absolute
discretion, determines cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either the shareholders of the General Partner or the Limited
Partners shall be resolved in favor of the shareholders of the General Partner. The General Partner shall not be liable for monetary
damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by the Limited Partners in connection with such decisions.
�
(c)����������Subject
to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in Section�6.01, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers
granted to it under this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its
agents. The General Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by
it in good faith.
�
(d)����������Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement or the Act, any action of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or any decision
of the General Partner to refrain from acting on behalf of the Partnership, undertaken in the good faith belief that such action
or omission is necessary or advisable in order (i)�to protect the ability of the General Partner to continue to qualify as
a REIT or (ii)�to prevent the General Partner from incurring any taxes under Section�857, Section�4981 or any other
provision of the Code, is expressly authorized under this Agreement and is deemed approved by all of the Limited Partners.
�

�33
�
�
(e)����������Any
amendment, modification or repeal of this Section�6.04 or any provision shall be prospective only and shall not in any way
affect the limitations on the General Partner�s or any of its officer�s, director�s, agent�s or employee�s
liability to the Partnership and the Limited Partners under this Section�6.04 as in effect immediately before such amendment,
modification or repeal with respect to matters occurring, in whole or in part, before such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless
of when claims relating to such matters may arise or be asserted.
�
6.05�������Partnership
Obligations.
�
(a)����������Except
as provided in this Section�6.05 and elsewhere in this Agreement (including the provisions of Articles V and VI regarding
distributions, payments and allocations to which it may be entitled), the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services
as general partner of the Partnership.
�
(b)����������All
Administrative Expenses shall be obligations of the Partnership, and the General Partner shall be entitled to reimbursement by
the Partnership for any expenditure (including Administrative Expenses) incurred by it on behalf of the Partnership that shall
be made other than out of the funds of the Partnership. All reimbursements hereunder shall be characterized for federal income
tax purposes as expenses of the Partnership incurred on its behalf, and not as expenses of the General Partner.
�
6.06�������Outside
Activities. Subject to Section�6.08, the Charter and any agreements, including without limitation the Management
Agreement, entered into by the General Partner or its Affiliates with the Partnership or a Subsidiary, any officer, director,
employee, agent, trustee, Affiliate or shareholder of the General Partner, the General Partner shall be entitled to and may have
business interests and engage in business activities in addition to those relating to the Partnership, including business interests
and activities substantially similar or identical to those of the Partnership. Neither the Partnership nor any of the Limited
Partners shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any such business ventures, interest or activities. None of the
Limited Partners nor any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement or the partnership relationship established
hereby in any such business ventures, interests or activities, and the General Partner shall have no obligation pursuant to this
Agreement to offer any interest in any such business ventures, interests and activities to the Partnership or any Limited Partner,
even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Partnership or any Limited Partner, could be taken by such
Person.
�
6.07�������Employment
or Retention of Affiliates.
�
(a)����������Any
Affiliate of the General Partner may be employed or retained by the Partnership and may otherwise deal with the Partnership (whether
as a buyer, lessor, lessee, manager, furnisher of goods or services, broker, agent, lender or otherwise) and may receive from the
Partnership any compensation, price or other payment therefore that the General Partner determines to be fair and reasonable.
�

�34
�
�
(b)����������The
Partnership may lend or contribute to its Subsidiaries or other Persons in which it has an equity investment, and such Persons
may borrow funds from the Partnership, on terms and conditions established in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner.
The foregoing authority shall not create any right or benefit in favor of any Subsidiary or any other Person.
�
(c)����������The
Partnership may transfer assets to joint ventures, other partnerships, corporations or other business entities in which it is or
thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and subject to such conditions as the General Partner deems are consistent with this
Agreement and applicable law.
�
6.08�������General
Partner Activities. The General Partner agrees that, generally, all business activities of the General Partner,
including activities pertaining to the acquisition, development, ownership of or investment in real properties or other property,
shall be conducted through the Partnership or one or more Subsidiary Partnerships; provided, however, that the General Partner
may make direct acquisitions or undertake business activities if such acquisitions or activities are made in connection with the
issuance of Additional Securities by the General Partner or the business activity has been approved by a majority of the Independent
Directors. If, at any time, the General Partner acquires material assets (other than Partnership Units or other assets on behalf
of the Partnership), the definition of �REIT Common Shares Amount� may be adjusted, as reasonably determined by the
General Partner, to reflect only the fair market value of a REIT Common Share attributable to the General Partner�s Partnership
Units and other assets held on behalf of the Partnership.
�
6.09�������Title
to Partnership Assets. Title to Partnership assets, whether real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible,
shall be deemed to be owned by the Partnership as an entity, and no Partner, individually or collectively, shall have any ownership
interest in such Partnership assets or any portion thereof. Title to any or all of the Partnership assets may be held in the name
of the Partnership, the General Partner or one or more nominees, as the General Partner may determine, including Affiliates of
the General Partner. The General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any Partnership assets for which legal title is held
in the name of the General Partner or any nominee or Affiliate of the General Partner shall be held by the General Partner for
the use and benefit of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that
the General Partner shall use its best efforts to cause beneficial and record title to such assets to be vested in the Partnership
as soon as reasonably practicable. All Partnership assets shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its books and
records, irrespective of the name in which legal title to such Partnership assets is held.
�
6.10�������Restrictions
on General Partner Authority. The General Partner may not take any action in contravention of an express prohibition
or limitation of this Agreement without the written consent of a Two Thirds Majority (other than the General Partner or any Subsidiary
of the General Partner), or such other percentage of the Limited Partners as may be specifically provided for under a provision
of this Agreement, and may not perform any act that would subject a Limited Partner to liability as a general partner in any jurisdiction
or any liability not contemplated herein or under the Act except with the written consent of such Limited Partner.

ARTICLE VII

CHANGES IN GENERAL PARTNER
�
7.01�������Transfer
of the General Partner�s Partnership Interest.
�
(a)����������The
General Partner shall not transfer all or any portion of its General Partnership Interests, and the General Partner shall not withdraw
as General Partner, except as provided in or in connection with a transaction contemplated by Sections�7.01(c), (d)�or
(e).
�
(b)����������The
General Partner agrees that its General Partnership Interest will at all times be in the aggregate at least 0.1%.
�
(c)����������Except
as otherwise provided in Section�7.01(d) or (e), the General Partner shall not engage in any merger, consolidation or other
combination with or into another Person or sale of all or substantially all of its assets (other than in connection with a change
in the General Partner�s state of incorporation or organizational form), in each case which results in a Change of Control
of the General Partner (a �Transaction�), unless at least one of the following conditions is met:
�
(i) the consent of a
Majority in Interest (other than the General Partner or any Subsidiary of the General Partner) is obtained;
�
(ii) as a result of
such Transaction, all Limited Partners (other than the General Partner and any Subsidiary of the General Partner) will receive,
or have the right to receive, for each Partnership Unit an amount of cash, securities or other property equal in value to the
product of the Conversion Factor and the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property paid in the Transaction to a holder
of one REIT Common Share in consideration of one REIT Common Share, provided that if, in connection with such Transaction,
a purchase, tender or exchange offer (�Offer�) shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of more
than 50% of the outstanding REIT Common Shares, each holder of Partnership Units (other than the General Partner and any Subsidiary
of the General Partner) shall be given the option to exchange its Partnership Units for the greatest amount of cash, securities
or other property that such Limited Partner would have received had it (A)�exercised its Common Unit Redemption Right pursuant
to Section�8.04 and (B)�sold, tendered or exchanged pursuant to the Offer the REIT Common Shares received upon exercise
of the Common Unit Redemption Right immediately before the expiration of the Offer; or
�
(iii) the General Partner
is the surviving entity in the Transaction and either (A)�the holders of REIT Common Shares do not receive cash, securities
or other property in the Transaction or (B)�all Limited Partners (other than the General Partner or any Subsidiary of the
General Partner) receive for each Partnership Unit an amount of cash, securities or other property (expressed as an amount per
REIT Common Share) that is no less in value than the product of the Conversion Factor and the greatest amount of cash, securities
or other property (expressed as an amount per REIT Common Share) received in the Transaction by any holder of REIT Common Shares.
�

�36
�
�
(d)����������Notwithstanding
Section�7.01(c), the General Partner may merge with or into or consolidate with another entity if immediately after such merger
or consolidation (i)�substantially all of the assets of the successor or surviving entity (the �Survivor�),
other than Partnership Units held by the General Partner, are contributed, directly or indirectly, to the Partnership as a Capital
Contribution in exchange for Partnership Units with a fair market value equal to the value of the assets so contributed as determined
by the Survivor in good faith and (ii)�the Survivor expressly agrees to assume all obligations of the General Partner hereunder.
Upon such contribution and assumption, the Survivor shall have the right and duty to amend this Agreement as set forth in this
Section�7.01(d). The Survivor shall in good faith arrive at a new method for the calculation of the Cash Amount, the REIT
Common Shares Amount and Conversion Factor for a Partnership Unit after any such merger or consolidation so as to approximate the
existing method for such calculation as closely as reasonably possible. Such calculation shall take into account, among other things,
the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property that was receivable upon such merger or consolidation by a holder of
REIT Common Shares or options, warrants or other rights relating thereto, and which a holder of Partnership Units could have acquired
had such Partnership Units been exchanged immediately before such merger or consolidation. Such amendment to this Agreement shall
provide for adjustment to such method of calculation, which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
provided for with respect to the Conversion Factor. The Survivor also shall in good faith modify the definition of REIT Common
Shares and make such amendments to Section�8.04 so as to approximate the existing rights and obligations set forth in Section�8.04
as closely as reasonably possible. The above provisions of this Section�7.01(d) shall similarly apply to successive mergers
or consolidations permitted hereunder.
�
In respect of any transaction
described in the preceding paragraph, the General Partner is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to structure such
transaction to avoid causing the Limited Partners (other than the General Partner or any Subsidiary) to recognize a gain for federal
income tax purposes by virtue of the occurrence of or their participation in such transaction, provided such efforts are consistent
with and subject in all respects to the exercise of the Board of Directors� fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the General
Partner under applicable law.
�
(e)����������Notwithstanding
anything in this Article�VII:
�
(i) The General Partner
may transfer all or any portion of its General Partnership Interest to (A)�any wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner
or (B)�the owner of all of the ownership interests of the General Partner, and following a transfer of all of its General
Partnership Interest, may withdraw as General Partner; and
�

�37
�
�
(ii) the General Partner
may engage in a transaction required by law or by the rules of any national securities exchange or over-the-counter interdealer
quotation system on which the REIT Common Shares are listed or traded.
�
7.02�������Admission
of a Substitute or Additional General Partner. A Person shall be admitted as a substitute or additional General
Partner of the Partnership only if the following terms and conditions are satisfied:
�
(a)����������the
Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner shall have accepted and agreed to be bound by all the terms
and provisions of this Agreement by executing a counterpart thereof and such other documents or instruments as may be required
or appropriate to effect the admission of such Person as a General Partner, and a certificate evidencing the admission of such
Person as a General Partner shall have been filed for recordation and all other actions required by Section�2.05 in connection
with such admission shall have been performed;
�
(b)����������if
the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner is a corporation or a partnership, it shall have provided
the Partnership with evidence satisfactory to counsel for the Partnership of such Person�s authority to become a General
Partner and to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement; and
�
(c)����������counsel
for the Partnership shall have rendered an opinion (relying on such opinions from other counsel as may be necessary) that the admission
of the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner is in conformity with the Act, that none of the actions
taken in connection with the admission of such Person as a substitute or additional General Partner will cause (i)�the Partnership
to be classified other than as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or (ii)�the loss of any Limited Partner�s
limited liability.
�
7.03�������Effect
of Bankruptcy, Withdrawal, Death or Dissolution of General Partner.
�
(a)����������Upon
the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to the General Partner (and its removal pursuant to Section�7.04(a)) or the death,
withdrawal, removal or dissolution of the General Partner (except that, if the General Partner is on the date of such occurrence
a partnership, the withdrawal, death, dissolution, Event of Bankruptcy as to, or removal of a partner in, such partnership shall
be deemed not to be a dissolution of the General Partner if the business of the General Partner is continued by the remaining partner
or partners), the Partnership shall be dissolved and terminated unless the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section�7.03(b).
The merger of the General Partner with or into any entity that is admitted as a substitute or successor General Partner pursuant
to Section�7.02 shall not be deemed to be the withdrawal, dissolution or removal of the General Partner.
�
(b)����������Following
the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to the General Partner (and its removal pursuant to Section�7.04(a)) or the death,
withdrawal, removal or dissolution of the General Partner (except that, if the General Partner is on the date of such occurrence
a partnership, the withdrawal, death, dissolution, Event of Bankruptcy as to, or removal of a partner in, such partnership shall
be deemed not to be a dissolution of the General Partner if the business of such General Partner is continued by the remaining
partner or partners), the Limited Partners, within 90�days after such occurrence, may elect to continue the business of the
Partnership for the balance of the term specified in Section�2.04 by selecting, subject to Section�7.02 and any other
provisions of this Agreement, a substitute General Partner by consent of a Majority in Interest. If the Limited Partners elect
to continue the business of the Partnership and admit a substitute General Partner, the relationship with the Partners and of any
Person who has acquired an interest of a Partner in the Partnership shall be governed by this Agreement.
�

�38
�
�
7.04�������Removal
of General Partner.
�
(a)����������Upon
the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to, or the dissolution of, the General Partner, the General Partner shall be deemed
to be removed automatically; provided, however, that if the General Partner is on the date of such occurrence a partnership, the
withdrawal, death, dissolution, Event of Bankruptcy as to or removal of a partner in such partnership shall be deemed not to be
a dissolution of the General Partner if the business of the General Partner is continued by the remaining partner or partners.
The Limited Partners may not remove the General Partner, with or without cause.
�
(b)����������If
the General Partner has been removed pursuant to this Section�7.04 and the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section�7.03,
the General Partner shall promptly transfer and assign its General Partnership Interest in the Partnership to the substitute General
Partner approved by a Majority in Interest in accordance with Section�7.03(b) and otherwise be admitted to the Partnership
in accordance with Section�7.02. At the time of assignment, the removed General Partner shall be entitled to receive from
the substitute General Partner the fair market value of the General Partnership Interest of such removed General Partner as reduced
by any damages caused to the Partnership by such General Partner. Such fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser mutually
agreed upon by the General Partner and a Majority in Interest (excluding the General Partner and any Subsidiary of the General
Partner) within ten days following the removal of the General Partner. In the event that the parties are unable to agree upon an
appraiser, the removed General Partner and a Majority in Interest (excluding the General Partner and any Subsidiary of the General
Partner) each shall select an appraiser. Each such appraiser shall complete an appraisal of the fair market value of the removed
General Partner�s General Partnership Interest within 30�days of the General Partner�s removal, and the fair market
value of the removed General Partner�s General Partnership Interest shall be the average of the two appraisals; provided,
however, that if the higher appraisal exceeds the lower appraisal by more than 20% of the amount of the lower appraisal, the two
appraisers, no later than 40�days after the removal of the General Partner, shall select a third appraiser who shall complete
an appraisal of the fair market value of the removed General Partner�s General Partnership Interest no later than 60�days
after the removal of the General Partner. In such case, the fair market value of the removed General Partner�s General Partnership
Interest shall be the average of the two appraisals closest in value.
�

�39
�
�
(c)����������The
General Partnership Interest of a removed General Partner, during the time after default until transfer under Section�7.04(b),
shall be converted to that of a special Limited Partner; provided, however, such removed General Partner shall not have any rights
to participate in the management and affairs of the Partnership, and shall not be entitled to any portion of the income, expense,
profit, gain or loss allocations or cash distributions allocable or payable, as the case may be, to the Limited Partners. Instead,
such removed General Partner shall receive and be entitled only to retain distributions or allocations of such items that it would
have been entitled to receive in its capacity as General Partner, until the transfer is effective pursuant to Section�7.04(b).
�
(d)����������All
Partners shall have given and hereby do give such consents, shall take such actions and shall execute such documents as shall be
legally necessary and sufficient to effect all the foregoing provisions of this Section�7.04.

ARTICLE VIII
�
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS
�
8.01��������Management
of the Partnership. The Limited Partners shall not participate in the management or control of Partnership business
nor shall they transact any business for the Partnership, nor shall they have the power to sign for or bind the Partnership, such
powers being vested solely and exclusively in the General Partner, which shall act for the benefit of the Partnership, the Limited
Partners and the General Partner�s stockholders, collectively.
�
8.02��������Power
of Attorney. Each Limited Partner hereby irrevocably appoints the General Partner its true and lawful attorney-in-fact,
who may act for each Limited Partner and in its name, place and stead, and for its use and benefit, to sign, acknowledge, swear
to, deliver, file or record, at the appropriate public offices, any and all documents, certificates and instruments as may be
deemed necessary or desirable by the General Partner to carry out fully the provisions of this Agreement and the Act in accordance
with their terms, including amendments, which power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive the death, dissolution
or legal incapacity of the Limited Partner, or the transfer by the Limited Partner of any part or all of its Partnership Interest.
�
8.03��������Limitation
on Liability of Limited Partners. No Limited Partner shall be liable for any debts, liabilities, contracts or obligations
of the Partnership. A Limited Partner shall be liable to the Partnership only to make payments of its Capital Contribution, if
any, as and when due hereunder. After its Capital Contribution is fully paid, no Limited Partner shall, except as otherwise required
by the Act, be required to make any further Capital Contributions or other payments or lend any funds to the Partnership.
�

�40
�
�
8.04��������Common
Unit Redemption Right.
�
(a)�����������Subject
to Sections�8.04(b), (c), (d), (e)�and (f) and the provisions of any agreements between the Partnership and one or more
Limited Partners with respect to Common Units (including any LTIP Units that are converted into Common Units) held by them, each
Limited Partner (other than the General Partner or any Subsidiary of the General Partner) shall have the right (the �Common
Unit Redemption Right�) to require the Partnership to redeem on a Specified Redemption Date all or a portion of the Common
Units held by such Limited Partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Common Redemption Amount to be paid by
the Partnership, provided that such Common Units (or the LTIP Units converted into such Common Units) shall have been outstanding
for at least one year (or such lesser time as determined by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion), and subject
to any restriction agreed to in writing between the Redeeming Limited Partner and the Partnership or General Partner. The Common
Unit Redemption Right shall be exercised pursuant to a Notice of Exercise of Redemption Right in the form attached hereto as Exhibit�B
delivered to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) by the Limited Partner who is exercising the Common Unit Redemption
Right (the �Redeeming Limited Partner�); provided, however, that the Partnership shall, in its sole and absolute
discretion, have the option to deliver either the Cash Amount or the REIT Common Shares Amount; provided, further, that the Partnership
shall not be obligated to satisfy such Common Unit Redemption Right if the General Partner elects to purchase the Common Units
subject to the Notice of Redemption; and provided, further, that, subject to the terms of any agreement between the General Partner
and a Limited Partner with respect to Common Units (or any LTIP Units converted into such Common Units) held by such Limited Partner,
no Limited Partner may deliver more than two Notices of Redemption during each calendar year. A Limited Partner may not exercise
the Common Unit Redemption Right for less than one thousand (1,000) Common Units or, if such Limited Partner holds less than one
thousand (1,000) Common Units, all of the Common Units held by such Limited Partner. The Redeeming Limited Partner shall have no
right, with respect to any Common Units so redeemed, to receive any distribution paid with respect to Common Units if the record
date for such distribution is on or after the Specified Redemption Date.
�
(b)�����������Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section�8.04(a), a Limited Partner that exercises the Common Unit Redemption Right shall be deemed to have
offered to sell the Common Units described in the Notice of Redemption to the General Partner, and the General Partner may, in
its sole and absolute discretion, elect to purchase directly and acquire such Common Units by paying to the Redeeming Limited Partner
either the Cash Amount or the REIT Common Shares Amount, as elected by the General Partner (in its sole and absolute discretion),
on the Specified Redemption Date, whereupon the General Partner shall acquire the Common Units offered for redemption by the Redeeming
Limited Partner and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of such Common Units. If the General Partner
shall elect to exercise its right to purchase Common Units under this Section�8.04(b) with respect to a Notice of Redemption,
it shall so notify the Redeeming Limited Partner within five Business Days after the receipt by the General Partner of such Notice
of Redemption.
�
If the General Partner
shall exercise its right to purchase Common Units with respect to the exercise of a Common Unit Redemption Right, the Partnership
shall have no obligation to pay any amount to the Redeeming Limited Partner with respect to such Redeeming Limited Partner�s
exercise of such Common Unit Redemption Right, and each of the Redeeming Limited Partner, the Partnership and the General Partner
shall treat the transaction between the General Partner and the Redeeming Limited Partner for federal income tax purposes as a
sale of the Redeeming Limited Partner�s Common Units to the General Partner. Each Redeeming Limited Partner agrees to execute
such documents as the General Partner may reasonably require in connection with the issuance of REIT Common Shares upon exercise
of the Common Unit Redemption Right.
�

�41
�
�
(c)����������Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section�8.04(a) and 8.04(b), a Limited Partner shall not be entitled to exercise the Common Unit Redemption
Right if the delivery of REIT Common Shares to such Limited Partner on the Specified Redemption Date by the General Partner pursuant
to Section 8.04(b) (regardless of whether or not the General Partner would in fact exercise its rights under Section�8.04(b))
would (i)�result in such Limited Partner or any other Person (as defined in the Charter) owning, directly or indirectly, REIT
Common Shares in excess of the Share Ownership Limit or any Excepted Holder Limit and calculated in accordance therewith, except
as provided in the Charter, (ii)�result in REIT Common Shares being owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference
to any rules of attribution), (iii)�result in the General Partner being �closely held� within the meaning of Section
856(h) of the Code, (iv)�cause the General Partner to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the ownership interests
in a tenant (other than a TRS) of the General Partner�s, the Partnership�s or a Subsidiary Partnership�s real
property, within the meaning of Section�856(d)(2)(B) of the Code, (v)�otherwise cause the General Partner to fail to
qualify as a REIT under the Code or (vi)�cause the acquisition of REIT Common Shares by such Limited Partner to be �integrated�
with any other distribution of REIT Common Shares or Common Units for purposes of complying with the registration provisions of
the Securities Act or the qualification provisions of Regulation A promulgated thereunder. The General Partner, in its sole and
absolute discretion, may waive the restriction on redemption set forth in this Section�8.04(c).
�
(d)����������Any
Cash Amount to be paid to a Redeeming Limited Partner pursuant to this Section�8.04 shall be paid on the Specified Redemption
Date. Any REIT Common Share Amount to be paid to a Redeeming Limited Partner pursuant to this Section�8.04 shall be paid on
the Specified Redemption Date.
�
(e)����������Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner is authorized to take any action that it determines to be necessary
or appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any withholding requirements established under the Code or any other federal,
state or local law that apply upon a Redeeming Limited Partner�s exercise of the Common Unit Redemption Right. If a Redeeming
Limited Partner believes that it is exempt from such withholding upon the exercise of the Common Unit Redemption Right, such Partner
must furnish the General Partner with a FIRPTA Certificate in substantially the form attached as Exhibit�C and any
similar forms or certificates required to avoid or reduce the withholding under state, local or foreign law. If the Partnership
or the General Partner is required to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any amount upon a Redeeming Limited Partner�s
exercise of the Common Unit Redemption Right and if the Common Redemption Amount equals or exceeds the Withheld Amount, the Withheld
Amount shall be treated as an amount received by such Partner in redemption of its Common Units. If, however, the Common Redemption
Amount is less than the Withheld Amount, the Redeeming Limited Partner shall not receive any portion of the Common Redemption Amount,
the Common Redemption Amount shall be treated as an amount received by such Partner in redemption of its Common Units, and the
Partner shall contribute the excess of the Withheld Amount over the Common Redemption Amount to the Partnership before the Partnership
is required to pay over such excess to a taxing authority.
�

�42
�
�
(f)����������Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner shall place appropriate restrictions on the ability of the Limited Partners
to exercise their Common Unit Redemption Rights as and if deemed necessary or reasonable to ensure that the Partnership does not
constitute a �publicly traded partnership� taxable as a corporation under Section�7704 of the Code. If and when
the General Partner determines that imposing such restrictions is necessary, the General Partner shall give prompt written notice
thereof (a �Restriction Notice�) to each of the Limited Partners, which notice shall be accompanied by a copy
of an opinion of counsel to the Partnership that states that, in the opinion of such counsel, restrictions are necessary or reasonable
to avoid the Partnership being treated as a �publicly traded partnership� under Section�7704 of the Code.

(a)����������Each
Limited Partner, by its signature below or by its subsequent admission to the Partnership, hereby represents and warrants to the
General Partner and to the Partnership that the acquisition of such Limited Partner�s Partnership Units is made for investment
purposes only and not with a view to the resale or distribution of such Partnership Units.
�
(b)����������Subject
to the provisions of Section�9.02, each Limited Partner agrees that such Limited Partner will not sell, assign or otherwise
transfer such Limited Partner�s Partnership Units or any fraction thereof, whether voluntarily or by operation of law or
at judicial sale or otherwise, to any Person who does not make the representations and warranties to the General Partner set forth
in Section�9.01(a).
�
9.02�������Restrictions
on Transfer of Partnership Units.
�
(a)����������Subject
to the provisions of Sections�9.02(b), (c)�and (d), no Limited Partner may offer, sell, assign, hypothecate, pledge or
otherwise transfer all or any portion of such Limited Partner�s Partnership Units, or any of such Limited Partner�s
economic rights as a Limited Partner, whether voluntarily or by operation of law or at judicial sale or otherwise (collectively,
a �Transfer�) without the consent of the General Partner, which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole
and absolute discretion. The General Partner may require, as a condition of any Transfer to which it consents, that the transferor
assume all costs incurred by the Partnership in connection therewith.
�

�43
�
�
(b)����������No
Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership other than as a result of a permitted Transfer (i.e., a Transfer consented
to as contemplated by clause (a)�above or clause (c)�below or a Transfer pursuant to Section�9.05) of all of such
Limited Partner�s Partnership Units pursuant to this Article�IX or pursuant to a redemption of all of such Limited Partner�s
Common Units pursuant to Section�8.04. Upon the permitted Transfer or redemption of all of a Limited Partner�s Common
Units, such Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner.
�
(c)����������Subject
to Sections�9.02(d), (e)�and (g), a Limited Partner may Transfer, with the written consent of the General Partner, all
or a portion of such Limited Partner�s Partnership Units to such Limited Partner�s (i)�parent or parent�s
spouse, (ii)�spouse, (iii)�natural or adopted descendant or descendants, (iv)�spouse of such Limited Partner�s
descendant, (v) brother or sister, (vi)�trust created by such Limited Partner for the primary benefit of such Limited Partner
and/or any such Person(s) described in (i)�through (v)�above, of which trust such Limited Partner or any such Person(s)
or bank or other commercial entity in the business of acting as a fiduciary in its ordinary course of business and having an equity
capitalization of at least $100,000,000 is a trustee, (vii)�a corporation, partnership or limited liability company controlled
by a Person or Persons named in (i)�through (v)�above, or (viii)�if the Limited Partner is an entity, its beneficial
owners.
�
(d)����������No
Limited Partner may effect a Transfer of its Partnership Units, in whole or in part, if, in the opinion of legal counsel for the
Partnership, such proposed Transfer would require the registration of the Partnership Units under the Securities Act or would otherwise
violate any applicable federal or state securities or blue sky law (including investment suitability standards).
�
(e)����������No
Transfer by a Limited Partner of its Partnership Units, in whole or in part, may be made to any Person if (i)�in the opinion
of legal counsel for the Partnership, such Transfer would result in the Partnership being treated as an association taxable as
a corporation (other than a qualified REIT subsidiary within the meaning of Section 856(i) of the Code), (ii)�in the opinion
of legal counsel for the Partnership, it would adversely affect the ability of the General Partner to continue to qualify as a
REIT or subject the General Partner to any additional taxes under Section 857 or Section�4981 of the Code or (iii)�such
Transfer is effectuated through an �established securities market� or a �secondary market (or the substantial
equivalent thereof)� within the meaning of Section�7704 of the Code.
�
(f)����������The
General Partner shall monitor the Transfers of Partnership Units (including any acquisition of Common Units by the Partnership
or the General Partner) to determine (i)�if such units could be treated as being traded on an �established securities
market� or a �secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)� within the meaning of Section�7704
of the Code and (ii) whether such Transfers could result in the Partnership being unable to qualify for the �safe harbors�
set forth in Regulations Section�1.7704-1 (or such other guidance subsequently published by the Service setting forth safe
harbors under which interests will not be treated as �readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent
thereof)� within the meaning of Section�7704 of the Code) (the �Secondary Market Safe Harbors�).
The General Partner shall have the authority (but shall not be required) to take any steps it determines are necessary or appropriate
in its sole and absolute discretion (i)�to prevent any Transfer of Partnership Units which could cause the Partnership to
become a �publicly traded partnership,� within the meaning of Code Section�7704 or (ii)�to ensure that one
or more of the Secondary Market Safe Harbors is met.
�

�44
�
�
(g)����������Any
purported Transfer in contravention of any of the provisions of this Article�IX shall be void ab initio and ineffectual
and shall not be binding upon, or recognized by, the General Partner or the Partnership.

of survivorship, provided, that such individuals either are married or are related and share the same home as tenants in common.
The written consent or vote of both owners of any such jointly held Partnership Unit shall be required to constitute the action
of the owners of such Partnership Unit; provided, however, that the written consent of only one joint owner will be required if
the Partnership has been provided with evidence satisfactory to the counsel for the Partnership that the actions of a single joint
owner can bind both owners under the applicable laws of the state of residence of such joint owners. Upon the death of one owner
of a Partnership Unit held in a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship, the Partnership Unit shall become owned solely by
the survivor as a Limited Partner and not as an assignee. The Partnership need not recognize the death of one of the owners of
a jointly-held Partnership Unit until it shall have received notice of such death. Upon notice to the General Partner from either
owner, the General Partner shall cause the Partnership Unit to be divided into two equal Partnership Units, which shall thereafter

date such petition is filed, or (ii)�mail a written notice to all Limited Partners, within such period, that describes the
General Partner�s reasons for determining not to file such a petition.
�
	Following the effective
date of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. 114-74 (�BBA�), the General Partner shall be the �partner
representative� as defined in Code Section 6223 as in effect following amendment by the BBA. If eligible to do so, the General

of Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code (as amended by the BBA) to the Company for taxable years beginning on or after January
1, 2018.
�
If the Internal Revenue
Service (�IRS�) makes an adjustment to the Company�s income, losses, deductions or credits or the Company
makes any such adjustment for a year for which a federal income tax return had been previously filed, the adjustment, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, shall be allocated, on the books and records of the Company, to the Partners (including former Partners
whose interest have not been fully liquidated) in accordance with their respective interests (including the interests of their
respective predecessors) in the Partnership for the year to which the adjustment related and, if the Partnership pays the tax liability
associated with the adjustment, such payment shall be allocated, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to such Partners in accordance
with the way that the corresponding income or reduction in tax credits was allocated.
�
Unless
each Partner timely elects, in a written notice to the General Partner, the Partnership and the General Partner, to the maximum
extent permitted by law (by making elections, not making elections, following options that may be available under guidance from
the IRS, and/or adjusting allocations) shall (A) timely elect, as provided by Code Section 6226 (added by BBA) and applicable Regulations
and other applicable guidance issued thereunder, to have the economic burden or benefits of any adjustment be borne by the Partners
in a way that is as close as possible to the way that such burdens or benefits would be borne if the Company�s returns for
the reviewed year (as defined in Code Section 6225(d)(1), as added by BBA) had been amended and new Schedule K-1s issued and, to
the extent required by law, the Partners had filed amended tax returns taking into account the amended Schedule K-1s and (B) issue
amended Schedule K-1s and such other required forms reflecting such adjustments and the Partners agree to file amended returns
reflecting the adjustments and information on the amended Schedule K-1s and/or such other applicable IRS forms.
�

�48
�
�
Upon the promulgation
of Treasury Regulations and/or other guidance implementing BBA (collectively, �Guidance�), the General Partner and
the other Partners will evaluate and consider options available with respect to preserving the allocations of responsibility and
authority and the elections and options described above with respect to conforming with the applicable provisions of the Code and
revised partnership audit procedures, and agree to use their good faith efforts to agree to mutually agreeable amendments to this
Agreement if necessary or beneficial to the Partners to better implement the BBA provisions and Guidance while preserving the terms
and agreements embodied herein.
�
(b)����������All
elections required or permitted to be made by the Partnership under the Code or any applicable state or local tax law shall be
made by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion.
�
(c)����������In
the event of a transfer of all or any part of the Partnership Interest of any Partner, the Partnership, at the option of the General
Partner, may elect pursuant to Section�754 of the Code to adjust the basis of the Properties. Notwithstanding anything contained
in Article�V of this Agreement, any adjustments made pursuant to Section�754 shall affect only the successor in interest
to the transferring Partner and in no event shall be taken into account in establishing, maintaining or computing Capital Accounts
for the other Partners for any purpose under this Agreement. Each Partner will furnish the Partnership with all information necessary
to give effect to such election.
�
(d)����������The
Partners, intending to be legally bound, hereby authorize the Partnership to make an election (the �Safe Harbor Election�)
to have the �liquidation value� safe harbor provided in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.83-3(1) and the Proposed
Revenue Procedure set forth in Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-43, as such safe harbor may be modified when such proposed
guidance is issued in final form or as amended by subsequently issued guidance (the �Safe Harbor�), apply to
any interest in the Partnership transferred to a service provider while the Safe Harbor Election remains effective, to the extent
such interest meets the Safe Harbor requirements (collectively, such interests are referred to as �Safe Harbor Interests�).
The Tax Matters Partner is authorized and directed to execute and file the Safe Harbor Election on behalf of the Partnership and
the Partners. The Partnership and the Partners (including any person to whom an interest in the Partnership is transferred in connection
with the performance of services) hereby agree to comply with all requirements of the Safe Harbor (including forfeiture allocations)
with respect to all Safe Harbor Interests and to prepare and file all U.S. federal income tax returns reporting the tax consequences
of the issuance and vesting of Safe Harbor Interests consistent with such final Safe Harbor guidance. The Partnership is also authorized
to take such actions as are necessary to achieve, under the Safe Harbor, the effect that the election and compliance with all requirements
of the Safe Harbor referred to above would be intended to achieve under Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.83-3, including
amending this Agreement.

any elections that the General Partner determines to be necessary or advisable in respect of any such guidance. Any such amendment
may include, without limitation, (a) a provision authorizing or directing the General Partner to make any election under the such
guidance, (b) a covenant by the Partnership and all of the Partners to agree to comply with the such guidance, (c) an amendment
to the capital account maintenance provisions and the allocation provisions contained in this Agreement so that such provisions
