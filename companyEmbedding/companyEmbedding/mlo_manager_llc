Whether you use for simple Things to Do list of Complex Project, Goals, recurring tasks. Read Manual to get most out of it. MLO2 is very intuitive and looks cool. I wish we could have a backup system.                    A Google User          The mobile version is becoming more useful. I still don't see the reasoning behind not giving those of is who paid for it, the ability to create reoccurring tasks such as every 3 days.  I also am not sure why the today view doesn't show, today, past due tasks unless you scroll back in time to find them. It's pointless on its current iteration.                    Brian Mason          Definitely the best tasks and to-do list available. Kind of expensive though if you want the desktop and mobile version plus synchronization cost extra as well.

I've been using My Life Organized a lot more lately and definitely seeing the benefits. I bought the cloud storage and love it. I also have the PC, Android and iOS versions.

Siddhartha Nadadhur          I am happy with the opportunity it offers in planning and scheduling for every task where almost 70% work done by following its simple steps and only thing left is implementation and now my initialization energy is very minimal to get work done. Thank you MLO                    Will Shafferman          Good syncing with desktop app. UI is pretty good. A fan of MLO in general. Best task management solution I have found by far.

Full Review       mylifeorganized.net February 24, 2016  In the latest update we added overdue tasks to the Today View. If you still see it not very much useful you can always hide the Today view in MLO settings. All your ideas on how to improve usability of the Today view and the app are always welcome on our forum.

Andrey.                  Will Shafferman  July 12, 2017                         Good syncing with desktop app. UI is pretty good. A fan of MLO in general. Best task management solution I have found by far. Main drawback is customer support options are limited, but good enough.   Full Review                    Xera Flurry  July 19, 2017                         It's a good to do list. I had kind of a hard time figuring it out at first, though. I was hoping for a full calendar view feature as well but didn't see one. I need multiple folders to manage home and other work I do. There's a way to do it it seems but I'd like an easier way where I can just click on a folder and add tasks or lists from there. If there IS a way to do that I'd like to know. I DO have a hard time navigating it. I'd like to keep it because I want to see my history on each completed tasks. That's the big thing I would like to see.   Full Review                    Jon Fierstein  July 9, 2017                         This app is the secret to my success.  It easily allows me to keep track of my professional projects and the tasks that make up those projects while assigning an appropriate importance level to each task that makes up the project.   The best part is the app is actively developed and new features are being added and current features are being improved.  I have one negative issue, although not with the software.    Recently I wrote to the Customer Service Dept. for MLO.  I was writing regarding an issue  critical to  me and my ongoing success.  They read my message because i  got a read receipt.  They did not reply.   After 2 weeks, I sent it again.  Still no response.  If this had happened with a company who's product was not critical to my life/success, I would have ceased using the software immediately on principal.  In this situation, I am stuck.   I need this software, I can't stop using it because there is no alternative that comes close to MLO.  But to have a simple request from a solid, dedicated, likely lifelong customer who has personally recruited 18 new users to MLO (They purchased Desktop & Mobile Versions)... that is just a slap in the face big time.   Full Review       mylifeorganized.net July 10, 2017  Please accept our deepest apologies for what happened. We've emailed you regarding the issue. 

Alyona                  James Alford  June 27, 2017                         Simply the most capable, customizable GTD task management tool available. I've been using MLO for years and have found nothing that even approaches it's power and flexibility. Just the best available.  :-)   Full Review       mylifeorganized.net January 14, 2016  Thanks James for using MLO!                  sergey shiyan  June 24, 2017                         I use app more one year and have positive feedback. A convenient menu structure, well-designed calendar interface with events and tasks. The app works stable and fast. Simple and convenient interface To-Do. Project and task management bar is implemented well with large number of settings and feathers. I recommend app for use.   Full Review                    Celia Roseboom  July 5, 2017                         I have used this app on and off over the years and I keep coming back to it. Earlier versions were a bit confusing though I loved the whole concept and tree structure of tasks and projects. They keep on adding new features and seem way ahead of the competition as far as task management is concerned. I'm looking forward to getting reacquainted with the app.   Full Review                    June 23, 2017                         The best GTD app. Really a professional application - there is  nothing else that comes close at this time. Syncing between platforms and devices is excellent. The Windows app is particularly fully featured. The level of branches and customisable filtering is so needed one wonders why there aren't more of these type of apps.   Full Review                    Jamie Bradshaw  June 23, 2017                         A fully featured app that is detailed enough to structure all your projects and tasks (in a GTD way) , and well designed enough to be useable. Also works nicely with the pc app for a great experience with both. Sounds like there are plans to keep everything updated. Overall a good premium option, and worth the price for the full package!   Full Review       mylifeorganized.net July 4, 2017  Thank you  a lot!

Alyona                  Obi Anthony Uchenna  June 25, 2017                         Dear MylifeOrganized team,   Thanks for your effort in organizing people's life. I appreciate you all in a very special way.   For the new feature, "STATISTICS", I am of the opinion that is gonna be an excellent feature.

If you convert a task to the project you will see the completion % for it depending on the number of completed subtasks and their efforts.

I tried Wunderlist, ToodleDo, ToDoist, and several others. What I was really looking for was unlimited subtasks, a strong outlining function, dependencies, notes, and seamless integration across desktop, tablet, and phone. I really needed a lightweight way to develop and manage multiple small projects. MLO finally gave me all of that. It allows me to be as simple or complex as I need to be. It's easy and intuitive to use right out of the box, but has deep features. It's not free, but it's cheap for what it is. It's well thought out, highly developed, and still easy to use. Highly recommended if you're looking for a task manager to manage actual work.   Full Review       mylifeorganized.net July 3, 2017  Thank you for your kind words, Mark.

Andrey.                  David Casson  May 29, 2017                         I absolutely love MLO. I tried it for a while when I was first learning GTD but wasn't ready to take the plunge (MLO is more complicated than other to do apps). After maybe a year or more with Todoist and having also looked around at other to do apps (and app-hijacks like The Secret Weapon by Braintoniq), I know beyond any shadow of a doubt that MLO is exactly what I want and, frighteningly, it's the only app out there like it. It's an app for people who are truly serious about task management, about getting their lives under control. The level of control this app gives you is outstanding and unparalleled. I am saddened that the GTD Facebook page never seems to mention MLO (although I've cheered for it more than once) and that the GTD website itself doesn't even have a guide for it.  Please give this exceptionally well crafted app a try! You will be impressed. Todoist gets high ratings because college sophomores who spend more time making YouTube videos about productivity than actually being productive upvote it before they've even tried the product. Give it a few months... And read GTD.   Full Review       mylifeorganized.net May 30, 2017  Thank you for your warm words, David!  At such moments we gain more and more confidence in what we do.

Alyona                  May 29, 2017                         You need to spend some time learning your way around it, but otherwise its a very good app for cross-platform task management.
