Getting AroundThis Section 8 housing program is located in the city of Los Angeles, California.  This community has a large population that commutes to work via car. In fact, approximately 77% of workers drive to work. The average commute is 30 minutes.Most families have two cars. In moving to the area, you should expect to own and maintain a vehicle in order to get around and/or commute to work.  If you do not own a vehicle at the moment, make sure to factor such a purchase into your costs of moving.Fortunately, there is a small number of people in the community that do commute via public transportation (approximately 11%), which signifies that while the option is not the most popular, it is definitely a feasible alternative.Further information indicates that a very small portion of the community (about 4%) is able to walk to most destinations.  Depending on one's needs, it may be possible to live in Los Angeles without any reliance on external transportation.  This makes Los Angeles a good place for those without cars.

Job OpportunitiesThis neighborhood is primarily made up of low income families. About 27% of the local population makes under $25,000 annually.  Given these statistics, it can be surmised that there are not many job opportunities available within this community and that public programs and the local education system are most likely neglected and/or underfunded.  This neighborhood is not recommended for individuals looking for work opportunities.
