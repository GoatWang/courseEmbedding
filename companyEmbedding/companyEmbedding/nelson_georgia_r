Your Georgia Job Awaits...








Job Landscape in Georgia




                                    Georgia is home to a number of federal facilities—like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Benning, and Kings Bay Naval Base—making it a popular hub for government jobs. But the state’s largest job market is in the trade, transportation, and utilities industry.    Georgia is also seeing a rise in the professional and business services, along with the healthcare and education fields. And as a national leader in cotton production, the textile manufacturing industry is healthy and thriving.    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Georgia's unemployment rate was 7.4 percent at the end of 2013. While slightly higher than the national average (6.7 percent), it was a significant boost from the 8.8 percent unemployment rate the state experienced during the middle of 2013.    With so many job opportunities springing up throughout Georgia, now’s the time to act. Livecareer makes it easy to find an open job no matter where you live. Whether you’re looking for work in Atlanta, Macon, Marietta, Albany, Decatur, or anywhere in between, Livecareer has thousands of promising positions that are right for you.    Search, find, and apply for a Georgia job in just a few clicks!

Your Georgia Job Awaits...








Job Landscape in Georgia




                                    Georgia is home to a number of federal facilities—like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Benning, and Kings Bay Naval Base—making it a popular hub for government jobs. But the state’s largest job market is in the trade, transportation, and utilities industry.    Georgia is also seeing a rise in the professional and business services, along with the healthcare and education fields. And as a national leader in cotton production, the textile manufacturing industry is healthy and thriving.    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Georgia's unemployment rate was 7.4 percent at the end of 2013. While slightly higher than the national average (6.7 percent), it was a significant boost from the 8.8 percent unemployment rate the state experienced during the middle of 2013.    With so many job opportunities springing up throughout Georgia, now’s the time to act. Livecareer makes it easy to find an open job no matter where you live. Whether you’re looking for work in Atlanta, Macon, Marietta, Albany, Decatur, or anywhere in between, Livecareer has thousands of promising positions that are right for you.    Search, find, and apply for a Georgia job in just a few clicks!

UnmatchedInnovation in Irrigation




The new spin on the Rotator®
 

Efficiency Re-Imagined
Nelson Irrigation’s Field-Proven Rotator® Technology is reaching 30
          years of service. This revolutionary concept has been taken to new
          levels — time and time again. This premier pivot sprinkler now does much
          more. The R3030 with the all new 3NV Nozzle system turns a great
          sprinkler into a highly effective farm management device.
