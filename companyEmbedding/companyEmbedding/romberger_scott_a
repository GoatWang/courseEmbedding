Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Select Medical Holdings Corporation (NYSE:SEM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.25)Consensus Price Target: $14.33 (12.87% downside)

On Being Professional


  
 
RKC is a firm of 95 attorneys representing corporate clients throughout the US.  While our primary emphasis is on the Southeast, our practice is national.

"Never underestimate the use of imagination and creativity to get the job done," says co-founding partner, William "Bud" Kirk.
When the founding partners encountered an unforeseeable roadblock at a Tampa courthouse in early 1983, they turned what could have been a major disappointment into what is now a memorable victory. "After we arrived, we quickly realized we could not get our demonstrative evidence through the doors of the building's elevator," recalls Thom Rumberger.

In the practice of litigation there are only two places you can be as far as technology is concerned: on the cutting edge or lagging behind the competition. We are committed to being on the forefront, arming our attorneys and legal staff with state-of-the-art technology so that information can be shared seamlessly and at a moment's notice when needed.  We integrate the latest technology into our practice at every level, including substantial investments in programming proprietary custom applications to better serve the needs of our clients, attorneys, and staff.  These systems and best practices provide us with a competitive advantage and can substantially decrease costs and increase efficiency in case management.

Thanks to the firm's legendary founders, Thom Rumberger, Bud Kirk and Dick Caldwell, Rumberger, Kirk & Caldwell has long focused on the importance of excellence, respect, civility, collegiality, cooperation, and teamwork in the firm's culture and history. Since the first day the doors opened, the founding partners emphasized these tenets, and our subsequent leaders have taken great care to cultivate these attributes throughout the years resulting in the continued growth, excellence, and reputation of the firm.
