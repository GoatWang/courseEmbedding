Vaccines






RSV

Highly contagious virus and with a high prevalence in developed countries, causing respiratory tract infections in patients of all ages. There is currently no approved RSV vaccine available.






HIV / AIDS

With over 34 million victims, it is the fourth cause of mortality worldwide. Mymetics’ HIV vaccine is the first with a demonstrated ability to prevent viral transmission in primates.






Malaria

Malaria is an entirely preventable and treatable mosquito-borne illness, but still caused 627,000 deaths in 2012… we are developing a transmission blocking malaria vaccine






Intra-nasal Influenza

Influenza, commonly referred as flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It rapidly spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics and imposes a considerable economic burden in the form of hospital and other health care costs and lost productivity. In annual influenza epidemics, 5-15% of the population is affected with upper respiratory tract infections.






Chikungunya

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by several species of mosquitos, which also are known to transmit Yellow Fever, Dengue and Zika.  Symptoms of Chikungunya include joint pain, swelling and stiffness of the joints, headache, fatigue, nausea, rash and fever. Arthritis is the most common direct consequence of infection.








Key Partnership



Our virosome vaccine technology and know-how has been validated through high value partnerships and collaboration with some of the world’s leading research funding organizations.

Development of vaccines candidates - Mymetics Corp































 














Vaccine pipeline







Mymetics is focused on two pathways to develop prophylactic vaccines:

The ability to build a first line of defence against viruses entering the blood stream by focusing on the mucosal layer.
The development of a new vaccine delivery platform that does not use live attenuated or killed pathogens, while increasing the immunogenicity and stability of the vaccine.

Using these two pathways, our pipeline comprises vaccine candidates at various stages of clinical development.
Our vaccine candidates for HIV/AIDS, malaria and the intra-nasal influenza are based upon the influenza virosomes, thereby using the influenza virosome as the carrier. While the RSV vaccine candidate is based on their own natural virus and used directly as the vaccine.

stopping the infection at its point of entry 


 
Influenza, commonly referred as flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It rapidly spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics and imposes a considerable economic burden in the form of hospital and other health care costs and lost productivity. In annual influenza epidemics, 5-15% of the population is affected with upper respiratory tract infections. Worldwide, these annual epidemics result in about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about 250 000 to 500 000 deaths (source WHO).
Mymetics’ influenza vaccine approach
Our influenza vaccine is based on virosomes that do not contain a “live virus”. The vaccine, being administered in the nose, can therefore fight the virus at the mucosal level by developing not only mucosal antibodies but also blood antibodies. Consequently, the infection is stopped at the point of entry and prevents even the earliest onset of disease.
Target population and market size
The seasonal flu market has reached close to USD 3 billion in 2012 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.2%. The intra-nasal application is expected to take market share from the injected vaccines due to ease of use and efficacy.
Status and next steps
Under an out-licensing contract with Abbott Biologicals, the Mymetics intra nasal influenza vaccine has successfully finished a Phase I trial on 110 people. The Phase I showed good safety and tolerance profiles and met and even exceeded all CHMP criteria (European EMA criteria for injected flu vaccines).
Partnering Opportunity:
Due to changes in strategy and reprioritization at Abbott, Mymetics has regained the ownership of the intra-nasal influenza vaccine and is ready to take this further in the clinic with strategic partners.

Research and development of virosome based vaccines - Mymetics Corp































 
















				Technology









Mymetics
The global leader in research and development of virosome based vaccines.
With more than 30 years of experience in the field of virosome vaccines, Mymetics has gained a unique R&D expertise, specialist know-how and intellectual property rights directly related to virosome based vaccines, making it the global leader in this field. Our team consist of the original inventors of the virosome technology, a platform that can be adapted to many vaccines.



What is a virosome?
Virosomes are lipid-based carriers (envelopes) containing the functional fusion viral proteins and natural membrane proteins of the natural virus. These lipid-based viral envelopes can be combined with additional rationally designed antigens or adjuvants if needed. 






How does it work?
Virosomes based vaccines are designed to maintain the immunogenicity of a live-attenuated virus but with the safety of a killed virus. The virosomes are devoid of the nucleocapsid and without the genetic material of the source virus, they are unable to replicate, cause an infection or a disease. However, it is presented to the immune system in the most natural manner, with the aim of containing the viral proteins and keep the fusion capacity of the virosome. Thereby it optimizes the immune response for later infection / exposure to the original virus. 





Why is it a unique and broadly applicable technology?
Virosomes can be made of any enveloped virus and are mainly used for two applications. The first application is as a vaccine candidate against the original enveloped virus from which the virosome is made, i.e. the Influenza virus, Respiratory Syncytial virus, Chikungunya, Cytomegalo virus, Herpes Simplex virus, etc. The second application is using the influenza virus virosome as a carrier for specific vaccinal antigens that can be derived from non-enveloped or enveloped viruses like HIV, as well as from more complex pathogens such as the Plasmodium falciparum causing malaria. Influenza virosomes may also be used for immunotherapy against cancer and it could be extended to other fields like allergies and autoimmune diseases. Virosomes provide a technology platform that can be adapted to many vaccines. Lipids, antigens, adjuvants, or other materials, can be added to the dissolved viral membrane or they can be included in the virosome during reconstitution. Our pipeline of novel vaccines reflects the broad potential of this technology platform with vaccine candidates in key disease areas.



Proven safety and tolerability
The safety and tolerability of influenza virosomes have already been proven. The vaccines Inflexal® for influenza and Epaxal® for Hepatitis A from Crucell (J&J) are approved products on the market both using virosomes from influenza as a delivery platform.
