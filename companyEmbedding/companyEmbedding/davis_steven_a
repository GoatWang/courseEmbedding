Find Your Next Home!
Welcome to the Stephen Davis Home Designs Plan Shop. Here you can browse some of Stephen’s most popular designs and choose the one that will become your next home.
There are two ways to purchase Stephen’s plans. First, you may purchase a PDF version of a full construction set of a particular plan, which you may take to your printer and have as many copies as you would like printed for your contractors. This is the best option if you are completely satisfied with a particular plan and do not have any changes. As an alternative, you may purchase the CAD files of a particular plan, which you can then take to your architect to customize as you wish. There are also options for changes to the foundation, as well as an option to flip the plan.
Once you have chosen your plan and your option, hit the "Add to Cart" button and from there you will be taken to your cart page, where you can either continue shopping or head to the checkout. Our checkout is through PayPal, where you can either use your PayPal account or pay by any major credit card.
After your transaction has completed, you will receive a confirmation email with all the details, and within two weeks after your transaction has completed, you will receive your plans via email.
If you can't find exactly what you are looking for, contact us to set up a consultation for a custom plan. We would love to help you design a one-of-a-kind home. And check back often because we are constantly adding new designs.
Thanks! Your next home awaits!

Boomkat Product Review:
Following up their 2009 collaboration on Important Records, Westering, clarinetist Gareth Davis and guitarist/avant-violinist Steven R. Smith return with The Line Across on the Alt.Vinyl label.  Musically, this pair are a great match, and the tones of their respective wind and string instruments merge for an absorbing free-flowing drift of texture and loose harmony.  Some of Smith's guitar passages come close to outright post-rock, but his deployment of the "spike fiddle" and "nail violin" help propel the record into dark and thorny directions that correlate nicely with Davis' bass and contrabass clarinets, in all their wild, overtone-spilling splendour.

        standards and undergo weekly scans monitoring our security status. 
      

        Additionally, we do not store any card details at all, all
        payments are handled using a system of Tokenisation which is
        an industry-standard method of secure payment handling. When
        you place an order with us payment is either handled via your
        Paypal account or if you choose to pay by credit/debit card we
        create a "Token" with your payment details which is stored by
        the Bank payment gateway. When you return to make a purchase
        it basically reactivates the "Token" so no details need to be
        entered again and those details are not stored by us.

        Shipping FAQs
      

        Free Shipping: We offer free postage on orders over
        £50.00 to the UK sent via Royal Mail.*
      

        *To qualify for free postage the order must be sent as one package.
        Therefore, all items must be in stock or you should be happy to wait
        until all items become available to ship so they can be sent as one
        package. Downloads and Gift Vouchers do not count towards free
        shipping. Please note that Pre-Orders do not count towards free
        shipping as their release dates are liable to fluctuate.
      
Stock Status

        If your order contains items that have different estimated
        shipping dates (for example, ‘available to pre-order’, ‘in stock’,
        ‘available to ship in 1-3 days’) you will be given an option either
        to wait for everything to become available to ship in one package,
        or to ship each item as soon as it becomes available.  Stock arrives
        at the office throughout the day so the stock status of items on the
        website can change several times a day.
      

        Important Note: all items that are not currently displaying as
        In Stock need to be ordered in from our suppliers and the estimated
        shipping dates are only an indication of when we expect those items
        to come into stock. If there are any unforeseen issues with
        availability we will notify you immediately.
      
Premium Packaging

        At checkout you are able to select a premium packaging option
        for a fee of £1.50. We pack all of our orders using appropriate
        packaging, however when you pick this option we use a wider
        cruciform offering additional protection if you have a
        particularly heavy-handed postman.
      
UK and International Shipping Options

        We offer two services:
      

        1.  First Class Royal Mail - for UK and for International
        orders: The package will be delivered by your national postal service.
      

        Royal Mail sets limits on the weight of packages, so if the order
        becomes too heavy to ship in one package the order will be split
        into two or more packages. The packages will be marked accordingly,
        for example, if an order has to be sent over two packages the packages
        would be labelled ‘1 of 2’ and ‘2 of 2’.
      

        2. Parcelforce tracked courier service:
      

        This comprises a flat box fee for UK (and some European countries),
        and a sliding scale based on weight for other countries. Parcelforce
        is a Monday - Friday service. Packages sent via Parcelforce can be
        tracked here:
        http://www.parcelforce.com/track-trace


        Parcelforce can only ship to PO boxes in certain countries,
        details can be found once you have made your country selection
        at checkout.
      

        Once you have added items to your crate you can select your
        country and choose either to send everything in one package or
        to ship as soon as the items become available. At this point the
        total given is a guide to the cost and more shipping configurations
        are available once you have logged in and proceeded to checkout.
        At the checkout you will still be able to add or take away items
        from the crate and change/compare your shipping options.
      

        Pre-orders are treated as separate packages to items that are
        either in stock or available to order. If pre-orders share the
        same release date then they can be ordered and shipped together.
        However pre-order release dates are liable to change, if you have
        ordered two pre-orders with the same date to ship together and
        then one release date gets pushed back, we will ship the available
        pre-order straight away and the second pre-order as soon as it
        becomes available with no extra shipping charge.
      

        If you choose to ship your order across more than one package you
        can select the Royal Mail service for one package and Parcelforce
        courier for the other.
      

        Exceptions:
      

        * if an individual item weighs more than 2kg and you are outside
        of the UK the package must be sent via courier as Royal Mail sets
        a 2kg limit on packages.
      

        * Royal Mail covers postage all countries, however Parcelforce is
        not available in every country.
      
Missing Packages

        If an order does not arrive, we can issue a replacement package.
        In the UK we consider a package to be missing after 15 working
        days. Most international orders are considered missing after 25
        working days with the exception of France, South America and Africa
        - packages to these destinations are considered missing after 60
        working days. Before we can issue a replacement, customers must
        have checked with their local depot/sorting office to see if their
        package is awaiting pick up. If we think there is an issue with
        the shipping address, or that packages are being stolen in the
        post, we reserve the right to refuse future orders to these
        addresses.
      
Insurance

        We automatically add an insurance supplement to orders over £30. 
        Orders between £30 - £49.99 are charged a 60p insurance supplement.
        Orders over £50 are charged a £3 insurance supplement.
      
Returned Packages

        If a package is returned to us because of an incomplete address,
        or because it was not collected from a local depot, we will have to
        charge you again in order to re-send it.  We will get in touch with
        you before any package is re-sent.
      
Delivery Times

        The delivery times below are estimates.  A lot depends on the
        efficiency of your local post service.

        In Stock (Ready to ship)
        Pre-Order with estimated shipping dates

        If your order contains items that have different estimated shipping
        dates you will be given an option either to wait for everything to
        become available to ship in one package, or to ship each item as soon
        as it becomes available. Stock arrives at the office throughout the
        day so the stock status of items on the website can change several
        times a day.

        Important Note: all items that are not currently displaying as In Stock
        need to be ordered in from our suppliers and the estimated shipping
        dates are only an indication of when we expect those items to come
        into stock. If there are any unforeseen issues with availability we
        will notify you immediately.

WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

        The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored
        at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may
        also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us
        or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other
        things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment
        details and the provision of support services. By submitting your
        personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
        We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your
        data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy,
        all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.
      

        We take the security of our website and of your transactions
        extremely seriously.  We encrypt all traffic involving personal
        data with industry-standard SSL certificates and we are also PCI
        compliant - meaning that we follow all current data security
        standards and undergo weekly scans monitoring our security status.
      

        Additionally, we do not store any card details at all, all payments
        are handled using a system of Tokenisation which is an
        industry-standard method of secure payment handling. When you place
        an order with us payment is either handled via your Paypal account
        or if you choose to pay by credit/debit card we create a "Token"
        with your payment details which is stored by the Bank payment gateway.
        When you return to make a purchase it basically reactivates the
        "Token" so no details need to be entered again and those details
        are not stored by us.
      

        Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password
        which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are
        responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you
        not to share a password with anyone.
      

        Although we will always do our best to protect your personal data, we
        cannot 100% guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site
        due to the nature of the internet. Any transmission is at your own risk,
        but once we have received your information, we will always use strict
        procedures and security protocols to try to ensure the safety of that
        information.

Product Description

As the global investment banking business enters its third year of lower revenues following the peak year of 2000, Bank management must address a host of issues: Business mix, Cost Management Risk, aligning interests of professionals with stockholders and attracting and leading a unique team of professionals. Based on an extensive interview series with over 50 banking professionals and independent experts, this book defines best practice in addressing each issue. It concludes with the outlook for the medium term expressed by interviewees as well as by the author’s own views.
