House Plan 6399: Central
                











                Paying tribute to the charming bungalows designed by California architects Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Greene, this efficient home allows even those on a budget to enjoy great style. Gable-end brackets and rafter tails punctuate the roofline on all sides of the home and are offset by horizontal lap siding in varying widths.

BasementPDFs Now!™
$250



A full in-ground basement design provides details for either poured concrete, or concrete masonry walls.  Please note that, in some cases, the design layout, and/or square footage may be adjusted slightly, as necessary to accommodate interior stairs into the basement area.  This is particularly the case, for example, with one level designs which do not already incorporate a stairway into the design.

Additional Sets
$20



A maximum of four additional sets may be added to your five set package, at the time you place your order.  Between planning and building departments, lending institutions, and neighborhood architectural review boards, extra sets may be necessary to provide enough sets for bids and construction.





Full Reverse SetsPDFs Now!™
$100



Reverse sets are mirror images of the design.  With "Full Reverse" plans, though the layout is mirrored, all of the text and dimensions have been adjusted to read normally --- not mirror image.  Customers have a strong preference for "right reading" plans, as many services simply print their plans from the back side, leaving text difficult to read, and leading to costly construction errors.

            Central Description - 6399
          

Paying tribute to the charming bungalows designed by California architects Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Greene, this efficient home allows even those on a budget to enjoy great style. Gable-end brackets and rafter tails punctuate the roofline on all sides of the home and are offset by horizontal lap siding in varying widths. Stone-clad pedestals provide solid support for the flared columns of the front porch resulting in an authentic look. Like many of the early Craftsman homes, the design is efficient and the footprint is square, which helps control building costs. The living spaces flow together at the rear of the home and are replete with amenities. The kitchen includes an island counter, the dining room offers a built-in hutch and French doors, and the great room provides a fireplace, vaulted ceiling, and built-in cabinets. An office, powder room, and laundry room are clustered together at the front of the main level. The upper level contains three bedrooms, placed at separate ends of the staircase landing and hallway, for privacy. The master suite includes a wall of windows with transoms, a walk-in closet, and a private bath with large shower. The secondary bedrooms share a bath that has separate compartments for the sink and the tub and toilet.
