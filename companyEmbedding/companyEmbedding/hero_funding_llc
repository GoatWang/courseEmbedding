The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

HERO Funding 2016-3 and HERO Funding II 2016-3B
August 26, 2016


In addition, PwC should not be regarded as having in any way warranted or given any assurance as to the following items:






·
The completeness, accuracy, appropriateness, quality or integrity of any of the information provided by the Responsible Party, or any other party for purposes of PwC performing the procedures agreed to by the Specified Parties. The procedures performed would not necessarily reveal any material misstatement of the amounts, balances, ratios, percentages or other relationships of the information included in the data provided to us;









·
The conformity of the origination of the assets to stated underwriting or credit extension guidelines, standards, criteria or other requirements;









·
The value of collateral securing such assets; and









·
The compliance of the originator of the assets with federal, state, and local laws and regulations.





We have not performed any procedures with respect to the fair value of the securities being offered in the Transaction and PwC expresses no opinion on the current fair value of these securities. PwC should not be regarded as having performed any procedures other than those detailed in this report.


We should not be regarded as having in any way warranted or given any assurance as to whether or not the information included in the Transaction documents or any other source document is sufficient to comply with any applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We did not perform any procedures to determine whether the Responsible Party is in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission.


With respect to any terms or requirements of the Transaction documents that do not appear in the exhibits, we performed no procedures and, accordingly, the procedures we performed would not ensure that any requirements are satisfied. Further, we have performed only the following agreed-upon procedures and therefore make no representations regarding the adequacy of disclosures or whether any material facts have been omitted from the Transaction documents.


It should be understood that we make no representations as to:






(i)
The interpretation of Transaction documents (including, but not limited to the offering documents) included in connection with our procedures;







(ii)
Your compliance with Rule 15Ga-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;







(iii)
The reasonableness of any of the assumptions provided by the Company; and







(iv)
The adequacy of the sample size, as provided by the Specified Parties, nor do we draw any conclusions about the pool of assessments with all assets in the securitization based on the sample size and results of the procedures performed.





These procedures should not be taken to supplant any additional inquiries or procedures that the Specified Parties would undertake in consideration of the transaction.


In connection with the Transaction, the Specified Parties agreed on a sample size of 135 PACE Assessments, and the Specified Parties have requested us to randomly select this sample from the pool of PACE Assessments underlying the PACE Bonds, which the Company represents will be sold to HERO Funding 2016-3 as part of the Transaction. The Specified Parties also requested we perform certain procedures over 180 PACE Bonds, which the Specified Parties represent as the entire population of PACE Bonds. The sufficiency of the sample size and the method for selecting the sample is solely the responsibility of the Specified Parties.

Independent Accountants’ Report on Applying Agreed-Upon Procedures
HERO Funding 2016-3 and HERO Funding II 2016-3B
August 26, 2016


For purposes of this report, we have performed agreed-upon procedures with respect to certain information related to the PACE Assessments and PACE Bonds, which the Company represented will be securitized as collateral by HERO Funding 2016-3. The agreed-upon procedures described herein relate solely to the PACE Assessments and PACE Bonds. The following phrases, terms and definitions, unless otherwise indicated, have been adopted in presenting our procedures and findings:

We were instructed by the Company to randomly select 115 PACE Assessments from the Initial Assessment Data Tape and randomly select an additional 20 PACE Assessments from the incremental PACE Assessments included in the Revised Assessment Data Tape which were not previously included in the Initial Assessment Data Tape. A random selection method ensures that all PACE Assessments have an equal chance of being selected from the respective population.

We applied the following procedures to each of the Sampled Assessments:

Per the Company’s instruction, the Specified Attributes “Products (1-9)” may be listed in a different order in the Assessment File when compared to the Revised Assessment Data Tape. The Company instructed us that no exception should be noted in the event of a different order of Products.


Per the Company’s instruction, the Specified Attributes “Products (1-9)” may be listed more than once for any given Sample Assessment in the Assessment File. The Company noted that if an identical Product was listed more than once in the Assessment File, and only listed once in the Revised Assessment Data Tape, no exception should be noted.


Per the Company’s instruction, the following mapping was provided for the Specified Attribute “Property Type:”

With respect to the “County” Specified Attribute, for HEROId “RSB30895N-160202,” both San Bernardino and Riverside were listed in the Contractual Assessment Data File. The Company provided the Grant Deed for the property associated with this PACE Assessment as an additional source for the “County” Specified Attribute, which also listed both San Bernardino and Riverside. The Company instructed us to compare the “County” Specified Attribute to the county where the property is physically located. In addition, the Company instructed us that the property is physically located in San Bernardino, which agrees to the “County” Specified
Attribute listed in the Revised Assessment Data Tape.


Per the Company’s instruction, a $1 difference threshold was applied for the Specified Attribute “Tax Payment.”


See Exhibit A for a list of differences identified by this procedure.






2.
Based on the Property Value Source listed in the Revised Assessment Data Tape, we observed the existence of one or more Property Reports provided in the Assessment File, which correspond to the Property Value Source contained in the Revised Assessment Data Tape as follows:







·
(“Z”) = Zillow Report;







·
(“P”) = Core Logic Report, or if not available the RA Property Report (Prequal Pro line item);







·
(“B”) = Black Knight Report;







·
(“A”) = Appraisal;







·
(“Tax”) = SPR, or if not available the RA Property Report (Tax Assessment line item); or







·
(“O”) = Other





Per the Company’s instruction, if the Property Value Source contained in the Revised Assessment Data Tape contained more than one of the above sources, we observed the existence of both sources listed in the Revised Assessment Data Tape. For example, if “Z,P” was listed in the Property Value Source field of the Revised Assessment Data Tape, we observed the existence of a Zillow Report as well as a Core Logic Report, and if the Core Logic Report is not available, then the RA Property Report (Prequal Pro line item). In addition, if a single source is listed in the Revised Assessment Data Tape and is observed in the Assessment File, the existence of a second source in the Assessment File will not result in an exception.

3.
We obtained the range of home values (“Assessment File Home Values”) from the Assessment File utilizing the Property Value Source identified in the Revised Assessment Data Tape and the following methodology provided by the Company:









·
If a single Property Value Source is listed in the Revised Assessment Data Tape, the range of Assessment File Home Values is the high and low home value listed on the applicable Property Value Source contained in the Assessment File. If Property Value Source is “Tax,” a single home value will be listed, and this will be utilized.









·
If there are two Property Value Sources listed in the Revised Assessment Data Tape, the range of Assessment File Home Values is the high home value listed on each applicable Property Value Source contained in the Assessment File.





We compared the Home Value contained in the Revised Assessment Data Tape to the Assessment File Home Values and found the Home Value to be within the range of Assessment File Home Values.






4.
We recalculated the Loan to Value (“LTV”) and compared the results rounded to the nearest 0.01% to the LTV as disclosed in the Revised Assessment Data Tape and found them to be in agreement. Using information obtained from the Revised Assessment Data Tape, we recalculated LTV as a) “Total Open Liens” over b) “Home Value.”









5.
We recalculated the Combined Loan to Value (“CLTV”) and compared the results rounded to the nearest 0.01% to the CLTV as disclosed in the Revised Assessment Date Tape and found them to be in agreement. Using information obtained from the Revised Assessment Data Tape, we recalculated CLTV by summing a) “Total Open Liens” and b) “Funded Amount” and dividing the result by “Home Value.”









6.
We recalculated Assessment Loan to Value (“Assessment-LTV”) and compared the results rounded to the nearest 0.01% to the Assessment-LTV disclosed in the Revised Assessment Data Tape and found them to be in agreement. Using information obtained from the Revised Assessment Data Tape, we recalculated Assessment-LTV as a) “Funded Amount” over b) “Home Value.”









7.
We recalculated the Reserve Fund Amount for each Sample Assessment and compared the results to the Reserve Fund Amount disclosed in the Revised Assessment Data Tape and found them to be in agreement. The Reserve Fund Amount was recalculated by multiplying a) “Funded Amount” obtained from the Revised Assessment Data Tape by b) 10 basis points for assessments with a Bond Id ending in “A” and 7.5 basis points for assessments with a Bond Id ending in a “C.”





We applied the following procedures with respect to the PACE Bonds:






8.
For each PACE Bond, we compared and agreed the attributes listed below, as set forth in the PACE Data Tape, to the information contained in the Supplemental Indentures and found them to be in agreement.

9.
For each PACE Bond, we recalculated the funded principal balance based on the sum of the following:







·
the “CurrentFaceAmount” for each PACE Bond provided within the PACE Data Tape, and







·
the sum of partial and full prepayments, for each PACE Bond, utilizing the “Bond Id” and “Prepayment Amount,” contained in the PACE Prepayment File provided by the Company.





We compared and agreed this amount to the “Principal Balance” attribute contained the Supplemental Indentures, and found them to be in agreement.






10.
For each PACE Bond, we recalculated the “Term” by subtracting the “First Pay Date” from the “Maturity Date” obtained from the Supplemental Indentures. The Company instructed us to round the results to the nearest Term as follows:









§
5 year term







§
10 year term







§
15 year term, and







§
20 year term.





We compared the recalculated Term to the Term listed in the PACE Data Tape and found them to be in agreement.


We were not engaged to, and did not conduct an examination or review, the objective of which would be the expression of an opinion or conclusion on the PACE Assessments, PACE Bonds, other information provided to us or included in the Transaction documents. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion or conclusion. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.


The procedures enumerated above were performed as of the date of this report, and we disclaim any consideration of any events and circumstances occurring after the date of this report. Further, we have no obligation to update this report because of events occurring, or data or information coming to our attention, subsequent to the date of this report.

John S.
"There were a lot of things we needed to address when we first moved into the house, and without the HERO Program, we would not have been able to address those things and get those things fixed. So it’s been a great program for us."






"The HERO team members make this process really easy and they help every step of the way. I was able to get solar and central A/C, something I really wanted but thought was cost restrictive."
JILDA C.
 















Ed P.
"Looking at all of our options, whether we paid cash for it or went through a local bank or lender, it seemed that HERO financing was the best fit for our budget."






"HERO financing was quick and efficient. If I could, I would always use their services for my home improvement needs. I am very pleased with HERO and I had an extremely great and positive experience."
DOROTHY T.
 




"Great experience. Easy application process. This has really given us the opportunity to reduce our energy usage and our utility bills dramatically."

Al H.
"If it wasn’t for the HERO Program, I would have probably had to do these projects one at a time and it would have taken me much more time to finance all these projects."











"So grateful for HERO! Was able to get some much needed repairs done and some of the things on our wish list for our home."
CATHEARA S.
 















Jordan & Christina
"It’s extremely low-maintenance and we’re saving money on water, and we’re able to finance it with HERO financing. It’s kind of a win/win."

On track to save enough electricity to power over a million homes for a year.1
100,000 homeowners have used HERO to finance their energy-saving projects. Over their lifetime, these improvements are projected to save current HERO homeowners more than $2.5 billion on electric bills.

On track to save enough water for the entire world to drink for a day.*
Current HERO homeowners are projected to save an estimated 7.4 billion gallons of water over the lifetime of their improvements—enough drinking water for every person on Earth for one day, with enough left over to fill over 4,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.

* Forecasts represent best estimates of growth based on historical HERO Program data, and should be considered approximations due to the nature and uncertainty of long-term multiple year projections. Actual results may vary.
