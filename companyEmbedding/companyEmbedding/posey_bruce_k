About Us



 


 


 
A Message from Ernest Posey
Health care is certainly at the forefront of everybody’s mind these days, but here at the Posey Company that has always been the norm. Since 1937, we have worked to develop products that place safety at the center of the circle of care. Today, our legacy as a leader in innovative and quality products pushes us to strive harder and focus our sights on comprehensive product solutions that support caregivers’ efforts. Our goal today remains, as it has for the past seventy-nine years; to provide a safer patient environment, reduce the risk of injuries, and minimize providers’ costs related to falls. Posey remains a family owned business, and we are constantly working to ensure that patient safety and quality of life remain paramount in everything we do. The company’s continued growth has required a physical expansion which includes additional office space, manufacturing and warehousing facilities. As we move forward, we recognize that our continued success is dependent on the valuable relationships that we have developed with our customers. It is these very relationships which help us to recognize and address product requirements for patient safety. With our team of innovators and your valuable input, we are able to provide products that speak to our understanding of the relationship between patient, caregiver, and provider. Thank you for your continued support. 
About the Posey Company
John Thornton Posey founded the Posey Company in 1937, when he built a bed cradle for a hospitalized friend who complained about the weight of the bedcovers on his feet. The hospital liked the idea, and asked for a price for 12 bed cradles. The Posey Company landed its first order, and made a profit of $12.

As John Posey showed the bed cradles to other hospitals in the San Francisco area, he was asked to develop other products to assist in patient care. Soon, he expanded his travels beyond San Francisco, and after many years, John built a company with a worldwide reputation for innovative and practical healthcare products. In 1991, John handed the president's gavel to his third son, Ernie, while maintaining a leadership role as Chairman of the Board.
Today, the Posey Company manufactures over 600 products around the globe. Every Posey product engineered and manufactured by our dedicated team continues on our tradition of quality products and patient care.
Posey products are available on a no-obligation 30-day trial (some restrictions apply, call Customer Service for details).

Vitality Medical is proud to sell Posey Company Products on our web site.  About the J. T. Posey Company and ProductsPosey founded the J.T. Posey Company in 1937, when he built a foot cradle for a hospitalized friend who complained about the weight of the bedcovers on his bare feet. The hospital liked the idea, and asked for a price for 12 foot cradles. The Posey Company landed its first order, and made a profit of $12. As John Posey showed the foot cradles to other hospitals in the San Francisco area, he was asked to develop other Posey company products to assist in patient care. Soon, he expanded his travels beyond San Francisco, and after many years John built the Posey Company which soon gained a worldwide reputation for innovative and practical healthcare products. In 1991, John Posey handed the president's gavel to his third son, Ernie, while maintaining a leadership role as Chairman of the Board.Today, the J.T. Posey Company manufactures over 600 healthcare/safety products with every Posey product bearing the Posey name and made to the same exacting standards established by John Posey over 60 years ago. The quality of Posey Company Products is the result of the dedication of over 300 craftsmen with an average tenure of 12 years service.Since introducing its first Posey Alarm in 1992, the Posey Company has become the leading provider of innovative, restraint-free, fall management products. Posey fall management products quickly earned the confidence of health care providers, and in a recent survey published by Nursing Homes Magazine, caregivers ranked the Posey Company #1 in fall prevention. Recent Posey product releases include the Posey Sitter II® Fall Prevention Monitor, Posey KeepSafe Deluxe Alarm System, Hipsters® Padded Briefs, Posey Floor Cushions, Posey Fall Management Blankets and the Floor Cushion Fall Mat. Popular Posey Company products include the Posey Gait Belt assortment, a selection of Posey Trach Ties, Posey Restraints, and Posey Bed Rails and other Bed Safety Protectors and accessories.
