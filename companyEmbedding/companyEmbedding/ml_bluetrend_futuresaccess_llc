 Managed Future Funds Fees & Expenses Class Action Lawsuit 

 
  

In November 2013, Bloomberg published a startling report about the fees and expenses some fund managers charge investors in “managed-futures” funds.  The conclusion was that in dozens and dozens of managed futures funds, the managers charged fees and expenses that totaled 89% of all the profit of that given fund.
A managed-futures fund  is an alternative investment, which is often defined as an investment other than cash, stocks, or bonds.  Typically these investments are sold to investors through brokers and many large brokerage houses have there own proprietary managed futures investments.  BarcalyHedge estimates that over $331 billion was invested in managed accounts in mid 2013.

SEC reporting requirements 
One difference between managed futures funds and say typical stocks and bonds is that in general managed futures funds are not required to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC does however require that all managed futures funds with more than 500 investors and more than $10 million in assets file financial reports within 120 days of their fiscal year’s end.  Bloomberg as part of its investigation concluded that there are currently 63 managed-futures funds that fit into this category. The vast majority of managed-futures funds, therefore, have no reporting requirement, as they are not subject to the 500 Investor Rule.

	Bloomberg’s big ciscovery regarding managed futures funds fees and expenses
Bloomberg concluded that managed-futures funds can charge clients 7% to 9% each year of the investment amount in the fund plus 20 percent of the funds’ profits.  (Hedge funds typically only charge a 2% management fee plus 20% of investor profits.)
Bloomberg next concluded that for the period from Jan. 1, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2012, a stunning 89% of the $11.51 billion of gains in these 63 managed-futures funds went to fees, commissions and expenses collected by the fund managers—not to investors. 

	One example: Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.
30,000 people invested approximately $797 million in Morgan Stanley's managed-futures fund called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P. From 2002 through 2012, the fund made approximately $490 million in trading gains and interest income. However, investors ended up losing money because those profits were depleted by over $498 million in commissions, expenses and fees paid to fund managers and Morgan Stanley. Despite the fund's value increase of approximately $490 million, investors ended up losing approximately $8 million over the course of those 10 years.

Merrill Lynch Managed-Futures Funds
Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments, LLC (MLAI) managed futures funds investment management services consist of acting as sponsor, general partner, manager, investment manager and investment advisor to pooled investment vehicles with portfolios of managed futures funds are marketed and sold to institutional and high-net-worth (HNW) investors through the Merrill Lynch FuturesAccess Platform. The FuturesAccess Platform provides access to MLAI Portfolio Funds or Portfolio Managers in MLAI’s advisory products or services.
Many high-net-worth investors understand very little about managed futures funds. Managed futures funds, touted by Merrill Lynch’s financial advisors, are recommended because the Merrill Lynch FuturesAccess Platform allegedly provides investors with access to an asset classes not readily available through traditional investments vehicles. Merrill Lynch financial advisors recommend the FuturesAccess managed futures funds to generate portfolio returns which they argue provide greater returns on a risk-adjusted basis. The purported low correlation of managed futures fund returns provides superior results for an investment portfolio during “down markets” which smooth portfolio returns over time. High-net-worth investors rely on Merrill Lynch managed futures fund managers as the experts at trading futures contracts. However, these highly misunderstood managed futures funds are laden with excessive fees, costs and commissions which may dramatically impact potential investor’s return on investment.
The Merrill Lynch’s FuturesAccess managed futures funds invest in asset classes that include trading futures contracts in equity indices (i.e. developed and emerging markets), interest rates (i.e. U.S. Bonds, Eurodollar Bonds, Euro-Bund), commodities (i.e. energy, agriculture and metals) and currencies (i.e. Dollar, Euro, Pound, Yen). Through investments in managed futures funds, investors are allegedly able to invest in asset classes that have a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed income securities markets which can result in greater risk-adjusted returns for an investor’s total portfolio.
At issue for investors is the performance of Merrill Lynch’s managed futures funds after the management fees have been deducted from the account. In most instances, the investment advisor is compensated by a flat management fee based on assets under management. Additionally, an “incentive-based” fee is deducted based on profits in “up” years. This “performance-based” fee is usually paid net of all fees. In addition to management and performance fees, a managed futures account has deducted from the balance expenses for transactions costs and commissions. The net result for investors has been the erosion of trading profits from a poorly-explained regime of excessive fees and conflicts of interest designed to enrich Merrill Lynch.
The MLAI FuturesAccess Platform are privately-placed and are sold to institutions and high-net-worth investors. Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments, LLC offers various managed futures funds, including:

Silver Law Group is currently investigating whether Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments, LLC and the FuturesAccess Platform managed futures funds are in compliance with the securities industry’s rules and regulations concerning the suitability and disclosure requirements related to the risks, fees and terms associated with the management of their managed futures funds. The focus of the investigation includes whether the fees and terms were adequately disclosed to investors for potential FINRA sales practice violations of misrepresentation or omission of material facts, and excessive markups and markdowns, and whether the recommendations made to investors resulted in unsuitable investment advice based on client investment ability to understand and assume the risks associated with managed futures funds.

Consulting service agreements are documents used when an individual or company hires an outside consultant for their expertise. Consultants work in multiple fields including the medical, engineering and human resources fields, and present expert opinions on the current conditions of their client's business.The contracts define the scope of the work the consultant will perform and outline the terms of their payment. These agreements also cover the method of payment and the estimated time for the project. Consulting service agreements may contain clauses that outline terms and conditions regarding the consultation, and will make the parties aware of any repercussions that may arise due to breach of contract.There are several varieties of consulting work, and a contract may contain language specific to a certain type. Contracts may include clauses regarding ownership of the work product, such as reports and case studies. Using a consultant services agreement helps a consultant see what the client expects.

2012

 


 


 


THIS SECOND
AMENDED AND RESTATED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OPERATING AGREEMENT
(“Agreement”) dated as of February 29, 2012 of ML
BlueTrend FuturesAccess LLC (this “FuturesAccess Fund”)
by and among Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the “Sponsor”), an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, and those
persons who shall invest in the units of limited liability company
interest (“Units”) created pursuant to this Agreement
— Class A, Class C, Class D, Class I, Class M, Class DS,
Class DT and such other classes as may be established in the future
— and shall therefore be admitted as members (such members
being hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as
“Investors”; provided, that for purposes of voting,
Units held by the Sponsor shall not be considered to be held by an
Investor).


 


WHEREAS, the
parties hereto desire to form or continue this FuturesAccess Fund,
a limited liability company under the provisions of the Delaware
Limited Liability Company Act (the “Act”), which shall
be one of the funds included in the FuturesAccess
SM Program (“FuturesAccess”); such
other funds to be hereinafter sometimes referred to as
“FuturesAccess Funds.”


 


WHEREAS, units
of limited liability company interest issued by this FuturesAccess
Fund shall hereinafter be referred to as
“Units.”


 


WHEREAS, the
Sponsor is the sponsor of this FuturesAccess Fund and the manager
of this FuturesAccess Fund for purposes of the Act.


 


WHEREAS, in
addition to FuturesAccess, the Sponsor also sponsors the
HedgeAccess SM
Program (“HedgeAccess”)
of private investment funds concentrating on securities, rather
than futures and forward trading (such funds being hereinafter
referred to as “HedgeAccess Funds”).


 


WHEREAS, the
parties hereby desire to set forth the terms pursuant to which this
FuturesAccess Fund shall be governed.


 


NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the premises, the mutual agreements herein
contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

all parts or sections thereof and exhibits or supplements thereto
(the “Disclosure Document”);

(iii)  




to engage in
any other lawful act or activity within and without the United
States for which limited liability companies may be organized under
the laws of the State of Delaware.






 







(b)  




This
FuturesAccess Fund, and the Sponsor on behalf of this FuturesAccess
Fund, shall have the power to enter into, make and perform all
contracts and other undertakings, and engage in all activities and
transactions as may be necessary or advisable to the carrying out
of the foregoing purposes, including, without limitation, the
power:






 







(i)  




to trade
futures, forwards, options and other instruments on margin and
otherwise;






 







(ii)  




to borrow money
from banks or brokers, and to secure the payment of any obligations
of this FuturesAccess Fund by hypothecation or pledge of all or
part of the assets of this FuturesAccess Fund;






 







(iii)  




to exercise, as
applicable, all rights, powers, privileges and other incidents of
ownership or possession with respect to the assets of this
FuturesAccess Fund;






 







(iv)  




to open,
maintain and close bank, brokerage and other accounts;






 







(v)

file all tax returns required of this FuturesAccess Fund and make

in connection therewith or as otherwise required or permitted by
applicable tax laws;






 







(vi)  




to bring,
defend, compromise and settle legal actions or other claims on
behalf of this FuturesAccess Fund;






 







(vii)  




to maintain

SECTION 1.02.   APPOINTMENT OF THE
TRADING ADVISOR; INVESTMENT OF CASH RESERVES. The Sponsor shall
appoint the Trading Advisor to have discretionary authority over
this FuturesAccess Fund’s trading and investing as described

execute transactions in commodity interests, currency interests,
swap agreements and any other manner of instruments, on either a
principal or an agency basis, with or through affiliates of the
Sponsor (the Sponsor and its affiliates, including Bank of America
Corporation, collectively “BAC”) or third
parties.  The sole clearing broker and the principal
forward trading counterparty for this FuturesAccess Fund shall be
BAC unless the Sponsor otherwise determines.  This
FuturesAccess Fund shall deposit all or substantially all of this

brokers selected by the Sponsor pursuant to the arrangements

bid-ask spreads from this FuturesAccess Fund but also will retain
significant economic benefits from the possession of this
FuturesAccess Fund’s assets (in addition to the interest
which BAC will credit to this FuturesAccess Fund’s
account).  In addition, the Sponsor may maintain this
FuturesAccess Fund’s assets in deposit or similar accounts
with, or in money market funds operated by, one or more affiliates
of the Sponsor, which affiliates may benefit from the possession of
such assets, as well as with unaffiliated entities.  The
interest paid by such affiliated and unaffiliated entities on this
FuturesAccess Fund’s cash so invested will be paid to this
FuturesAccess Fund.  However, neither the Sponsor nor any
of its affiliates (or any third parties) will be obligated to
account to this FuturesAccess Fund or any Investor for any
additional economic benefits which the Sponsor or any such
affiliate may derive from possession of this FuturesAccess
Fund’s assets.

  FISCAL
YEAR; ACCOUNTING PERIODS. The fiscal year of this FuturesAccess
Fund shall end on each December 31.  This FuturesAccess

following any redemption of Units; (iv) as of the beginning of each
calendar month; and (v) as of such other day as the Sponsor may

State of Delaware a registered agent and office.  The
identity and location of said registered agent and office shall be
determined by the Sponsor, and may be changed from time to time by
the Sponsor.  The initial registered office of this
FuturesAccess Fund in the State of Delaware is c/o The Corporation
Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street,

FuturesAccess Fund as hereinafter provided.

 


SECTION 1.06.
 
NON-ASSIGNABILITY OF UNITS; SUBSTITUTED INVESTORS; LIMITED
ASSIGNABILITY OF THE SPONSOR’S INTEREST.


 







(a)  




No Investor
shall assign, encumber, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise transfer
any of such Investor’s Units without the consent of the
Sponsor; provided, however, that an Investor may transfer the
economic benefit of ownership of such Investor’s Units
without the prior written consent of the Sponsor.  Any
assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation or transfer of
Units, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, to
which the Sponsor does not consent, and for which the
Sponsor’s consent was required pursuant to the previous
sentence, shall result in the Units so assigned, encumbered,
pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred being mandatorily
redeemed as of the end of the month during which such purported
assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation or transfer
occurred.  Any assignment, encumbrance, pledge,
hypothecation or transfer which shall result in the termination of
this FuturesAccess Fund for federal income tax purposes shall be
null and void ab initio and of no legal force or effect
whatsoever.  An assigning Investor shall remain liable to
this FuturesAccess Fund as provided in the Act, regardless of
whether his or her assignee becomes a substituted
Investor.






 







(b)  




The Sponsor may
not assign, encumber, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise transfer all
or any portion of its manager’s interest in this
FuturesAccess Fund; provided, that the Sponsor may assign such
interest to an affiliate of the Sponsor upon notice (which need not
be prior notice) to the Investors or in connection with the sale or
transfer of all or a material portion of the Sponsor’s equity
or assets.  See Sections 4.01 and 6.02
.






 


SECTION 1.07.
 
LIABILITY OF INVESTORS.


 







(a)  




Nothing herein
shall require the Sponsor to maintain any minimum net worth or
shall make any person associated with the Sponsor individually
liable for any debt, liability or obligation of this FuturesAccess
Fund or of the Sponsor.






 







(b)  




No Investor
shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance in the
capital account established for each Unit pursuant to Section
2.02 (“Capital Account”) of such
Investor.






 







(c)  




The Sponsor
shall have no obligation to restore any negative balance in any
Investor’s or in the Sponsor’s Capital
Account.

(d)  




Except as
provided in Section 2.08 (providing for chargebacks to
current or former Investors), the Sponsor and the Investors shall
be liable for the repayment, satisfaction and discharge of debts,
liabilities and obligations of this FuturesAccess Fund only to the
extent of the Sponsor’s or such Investor’s investment
in this FuturesAccess Fund and not in excess thereof.






 


ARTICLE II

CAPITAL AND TAX
ALLOCATIONS

 

SECTION 2.01.   CAPITAL
CONTRIBUTIONS.  All contributions of capital to this
FuturesAccess Fund (“Capital Contributions”) shall be
made in cash.  Capital Contributions may be made in such
amounts, and at such times, as the Sponsor may
determine.  The Sponsor may permit certain Investors to
make smaller initial or subsequent Capital Contributions than is
otherwise generally required by the Sponsor without entitling any
other Investor to make smaller initial or subsequent Capital
Contributions.

 


Investors will
receive Units in return for their Capital
Contributions.  Each class of Units (“Class”)
shall initially be issued at $1.00 per Unit, and thereafter at Net
Asset Value.  Investors’ subscriptions shall be
used to purchase the largest number of whole Units of the
appropriate Class possible; provided, that fractional Units may be
issued to Investors (or may be issued to the Sponsor or any other
BAC entity) in the discretion of the Sponsor.  If only
whole Units are issued, any subscription amount that cannot be used
to purchase whole Units will be credited (in cash) to
Investors’ BAC securities investment accounts
(“Securities Accounts”).


 


The Units may
be issued in the seven Classes described herein — Class A
Units, Class C Units, Class D Units, Class I Units, Class DS Units,
Class DT Units and Class M Units.  Units of a new Class
or series may be issued in the Sponsor’s sole
discretion.


 


Each Class of
Units is subject to different eligibility requirements as set forth
in the Disclosure Document.  Subject to the eligibility
requirements set forth in the Disclosure Document, there is no
minimum investment required to invest in Class A or
Class C Units other than the minimum initial subscription
otherwise required to invest in this FuturesAccess
Fund.  Unless otherwise indicated in the Disclosure
Document, the Class I Units are subject to a minimum investment
requirement that may be satisfied based on an Investor’s
total investments in this FuturesAccess Fund and Class D Units are
subject to a minimum investment requirement that may be satisfied
based on an Investor’s total investments in this
FuturesAccess Fund plus the Investor’s total investments in
certain other products offered or sponsored by BAC.


 


Class DS and
Class DT Units are open to investment by only other FuturesAccess
Funds and do not otherwise have any eligibility requirements except
as determined by the Sponsor from time to time.


 


Class M Units
are open to Investors that subscribe to this FuturesAccess Fund
through an eligible managed account program (a “Managed
Account”) at BAC and who satisfy other requirements as
determined by the Sponsor from time to time.


 


Once an
Investor is issued Class M Units, such Investor shall continue to
be issued Class M Units for so long as it continues to be eligible
to have, and in fact does have, a Managed Account.  If an
Investor holding Class M Units terminates its Managed Account, or
otherwise becomes ineligible to have a Managed Account, the Sponsor
may, in its sole discretion: (i) automatically convert the
Investor’s Class M Units to Class C, Class I or Class D Units
pursuant to such eligibility requirements and policies as
determined by the Sponsor from time to time; (ii) permit such
Investor to redeem its Class M Units as of the first available
redemption date following the termination of such Investor’s
Managed Account provided that a timely redemption notice is
submitted by the Investor or otherwise waived by the Sponsor; (iii)
mandatorily redeem such Investor’s Class M Units pursuant to
Section 3.04 ; or (iv) permit such Investor to continue to
hold such Class M Units for such time period as determined by the
Sponsor.


 


The Sponsor may
waive or modify any eligibility requirements applicable to a
particular Class of Units with respect to any one or more
Investors, including Sponsor Parties (as defined in Section
2.09 ), without entitling any other Investor to so such waiver
or modification provided that doing so is not materially adverse to
the interests of the Investors.

BlueTrend FuturesAccess LLC
Second
Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating
Agreement
Dated as
of February 29, 2012



 



 





 



 


This
FuturesAccess Fund may from time to time offer to certain BAC
investors a customized Class of Units having different financial
terms than those described herein or in the Disclosure Document,
provided that doing so does not have a material adverse effect on
existing Investors.  Such customized Classes will
generally be designed for Investors who are subject to additional
fees on their investments in this FuturesAccess Fund depending on
the Securities Account held by such Investors or other reasons, and
shall not be generally available to other Investors.


 


Sales
commissions will be deducted from Class A, Class D and Class I
subscriptions as described in the Disclosure Document, and the net
amount of such subscriptions (after deducting applicable sales
commissions) will be invested in the Units.  The Sponsor
may waive or reduce sales commissions for certain Investors without
entitling any other Investor to any such waiver or
reduction.


 


The Sponsor
(and/or any other BAC entity) may, but need not, make Capital
Contributions as of any date that any Units are
issued.  BAC may provide initial (“seed”)
capital to enable this FuturesAccess Fund to begin trading before
sufficient client capital has been raised to meet this
FuturesAccess Fund’s minimum capitalization.  Seed
capital (if any) will be invested in Class D Units, or Units of
such other Class as may be designated by the
Sponsor.  However, neither the Sponsor nor any other BAC
entity has any obligation to “seed” this FuturesAccess
Fund (or any other FuturesAccess Fund).


 

Provided this FuturesAccess Fund’s overall
minimum capitalization is met, there is no minimum number of Units
of a particular Class that must be sold in order for Units of that
particular Class to be issued.

 


Once this
FuturesAccess Fund has begun operations, there is no minimum dollar
amount of subscriptions that must be received as of the beginning
of any calendar quarter in order for additional Units of any Class
to be issued.  All Units will be issued only as the
Sponsor may determine, irrespective of how many subscriptions are
received.


 


The amount of
each Investor’s Capital Contribution shall be set forth in
such Investor’s Subscription Agreement Signature Pages
(“Signature Pages”) to the FuturesAccess
SM Program Subscription and Exchange Agreement
(“Subscription Agreement”).  A Subscription
Agreement, including the Signature Pages, must be completed and
accepted by the Sponsor prior to an Investor’s initial
Capital Contribution if such Investor is not already an investor in
FuturesAccess.  The Sponsor may require new Signature
Pages each time an existing Investor makes an additional Capital
Contribution or exchange.


 


The aggregate
of all Capital Contributions shall be available to this
FuturesAccess Fund to carry out its objectives and
purposes.


 


No Investor
shall be obligated to make any additional Capital Contributions,
except as provided in Section 2.08 .


 


No provision of
this Agreement shall be construed as guaranteeing the return, by
any Sponsor Party or this FuturesAccess Fund, of all or any part of
the Capital Contribution(s) of any Investor.


 


SECTION 2.02.
 
OPENING CAPITAL ACCOUNTS.


 







(a)  




There shall be
established for each Unit of each Class on the books of this
FuturesAccess Fund, as of the first day of each Accounting Period,
an opening capital account (“Opening Capital Account”)
which, for the Accounting Period as of the beginning of which such
Unit is issued, shall be the Capital Contribution made in respect
of such Unit and which, for each Accounting Period thereafter,
shall be an amount equal to the closing capital account
(“Closing Capital Account”) (determined as set forth in
Section 2.06 ) attributable to such Unit for the immediately
preceding Accounting Period.

The Sponsor
may, but shall not be required to, make Capital Contributions to
this FuturesAccess Fund from time to time as new Units are issued,
which shall be accounted for on a Unit-equivalent basis and shall
participate in the profits and losses of the Units on the same
basis as the Capital Accounts of the Class D Units.

For all

FINANCIAL ALLOCATIONS AMONG THE UNITS.  The net profits
and losses are allocated to each Class as provided in Section
2.06 and shall be allocated equally among the Units of such
Class.  All Units of the same Class shall have the same
Net Asset Value.


 


SECTION 2.04.
  NET
ASSET VALUE.  For the purposes of this Agreement, unless
the context otherwise requires, “Net Assets” and
“Net Asset Value” shall mean assets less
liabilities.  For purposes of determining Opening Capital
Accounts, Net Asset Value shall be determined as of the beginning
of, and for purposes of determining Closing Capital Accounts, Net
Asset Value will be determined as of the close of, business on the
relevant valuation date.


 







(a)  




The assets of
this FuturesAccess Fund shall include:






 







(i)  




all cash on
hand or on deposit in bank or other interest-bearing accounts,

Section 2.10 ;






 







(iii)  




all bills,
demand notes and accounts receivable;






 







(iv)  




all securities
(including, without limitation, money-market funds, Treasury bills
and other short-term, interest-bearing instruments), commodity
interests, currency interests, swap agreements and all other
instruments owned or contracted for by this FuturesAccess
Fund;






 







(v)  




all interest
accrued on any interest-bearing securities owned by this
FuturesAccess Fund except to the extent that the same is included
or reflected in the valuation of such securities; and






 







(vi)  




all other
assets of every kind and nature, including prepaid
expenses.






 







(b)  




The liabilities
of this FuturesAccess Fund shall be deemed to include the following
(provided, however, that in determining the amount of such
liabilities, this FuturesAccess Fund may calculate expenses of a
regular or recurring nature for any given period on an estimated
basis in advance, and may accrue the same in such manner as the
Sponsor may deem appropriate over such period):






 







(i)  




any accrued
losses on open positions which have not been settled by debiting
this FuturesAccess Fund’s account, as valued pursuant to
Section 2.10 ;






 







(ii)  




all bills and
accounts payable;






 







(iii)  




all expenses
accrued, reimbursable or payable; and






 







(iv)  




all other
liabilities, present or future, including such reserves as the
Sponsor may (as contemplated by Section 2.04(g) ) deem
advisable.






 







(c)  




The management
fees payable to the Trading Advisor (“Management
Fees”), the performance fees payable to the Trading Advisor
(“Performance Fees”) and the “Sponsor’s
Fees” (as defined in Section 2.05(a) )  
shall be determined, and Units’ Capital Accounts
correspondingly reduced, after the allocation of the other
components of Net Asset Value, as described above; provided that
interest income may or may not be included in Net Asset Value for
purposes of calculating the Performance Fees as agreed upon between
the Sponsor and the Trading Advisor.

(d)  




Operating
expenses shall be allocated among the Units pro rata based
on their respective Net Asset Values as of the beginning of the
month.






 







(e)  




Extraordinary
costs, if any, shall be allocated as incurred in such manner as the
Sponsor may deem to be fair and equitable.






 







(f)  




Organizational
and initial offering costs shall be deducted from Net Asset Value
in installments as of the end of each of the first 60 calendar
months after the initial issuance of the Units.  However,
for financial reporting purposes, organizational costs, to the
extent material, will be deducted from net asset value as of the
date of such initial issuance and initial offering costs will be
amortized over a 12-month period to the extent material.






 







(g)  




All Investors,
by becoming party to this Agreement, hereby agree and consent to
the Sponsor’s authority to establish whatever reserves the
Sponsor may determine to be appropriate in order to cover losses,
contingencies, liabilities, uncertain valuations and other
factors.  Any such reserves shall, unless the Sponsor
determines that such reserves are properly attributable to certain
but less than all outstanding Units, reduce the Net Asset Value of
the Units of each Class pro rata based on their respective
Net Asset Values, after reduction for accrued Sponsor’s Fees,
operating expenses and extraordinary expenses until such time, if
any, as such reserves are reversed.  Reserves, when
reversed, shall be similarly allocated among the Units then
outstanding pro rata based on their respective Net Asset
Value (irrespective of whether such Units were outstanding when the
reserves were established).






 







(h)  




The Sponsor may
suspend the calculation of Net Asset Value during any period for
which the Sponsor is unable to value a material portion of this
FuturesAccess Fund’s positions.  The Sponsor will
give notice of any such suspension to all Investors.






 


SECTION 2.05.
 
SPONSOR’S FEES; MANAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE FEES; TRANSACTION
COSTS; OPERATING EXPENSES.


 







(a)  




The Sponsor
shall receive monthly sponsor’s fees (“Sponsor’s
Fees”), payable in arrears of 1/12 of 1.50%, 2.50%, 0% and
1.10%, respectively, of the aggregate Net Asset Value of the Class
A, Class C, Class D and Class I Units, in each case as of the close
of business (as determined by the Sponsor) on the last business day
of each calendar month (Net Asset Value for purposes of calculating
the Sponsor’s Fees shall not be reduced by the accrued
Sponsor’s Fees being calculated).  The
Sponsor’s Fees shall be accrued monthly.  The
Sponsor may waive or reduce Sponsor’s Fees for certain
Investors without entitling any other Investor to any such waiver
or reduction.  No Sponsor’s Fees shall be charged
to Class DS, Class DT or Class M Units, unless otherwise determined
by the Sponsor.






 







(b)  




This
FuturesAccess Fund shall reimburse the Sponsor for the
organizational and initial offering costs incurred by this
FuturesAccess Fund in respect of the initial offering of the Units
(of all Classes combined) as determined by the Sponsor in its sole
discretion.  If this FuturesAccess Fund dissolves prior
to the end of the 60-month period described in Section
2.04(f) , the Sponsor shall reimburse this FuturesAccess Fund
for any such costs that have not yet been amortized.






 







(c)  




The
Sponsor’s Fees, as well as operating expenses due to the
Sponsor (including:  organizational and initial offering
costs; ongoing offering costs; administrative, custody, transfer,
subscription and redemption processing, legal, regulatory, filing,
tax, audit, escrow, accounting and printing costs; and
extraordinary expenses), shall be debited by the Sponsor directly
from this FuturesAccess Fund’s account and paid to the
Sponsor, where appropriate, as if to a third party, not credited to
the Sponsor’s Capital Account.






 







(d)  




This
FuturesAccess Fund shall pay all transaction costs (including
futures brokerage commissions and bid-ask spreads as well as
interest on foreign currency borrowings), as well as all Management
and Performance Fees, as incurred.

(e)  




The
Sponsor’s Fees, but not reimbursement payments for
organizational and initial offering costs, shall be appropriately
pro rated in the case of partial calendar months.






 







(f)  




This
FuturesAccess Fund shall pay all expenses, including administrative
and ongoing offering costs, as well as any extraordinary expenses,
incurred in its operations (including the expenses of any services
provided by the Sponsor, other than in its capacity as Sponsor, or
its affiliates); provided, that this FuturesAccess Fund shall not
pay any allocable Sponsor overhead.






 







(g)  




The Sponsor
retains outside service providers to supply tax reporting, custody
and accounting services to FuturesAccess.  This
FuturesAccess Fund’s operating costs will include its
allocable share of the fees and expenses of such service providers,
as well as the fees and expenses of any BAC entity which may
provide such (or other) services in the future.

The Capital
Account of the Sponsor (if any) shall not be subject to
Sponsor’s Fees.






 


SECTION 2.06.
 
ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES FOR FINANCIAL
PURPOSES.  As of the end of each Accounting Period and
before giving effect to any redemptions then being made, the
Closing Capital Account of each Class shall be determined by
adjusting the Opening Capital Account of each such Class as of the
beginning of such Accounting Period in the following
manner:


 







(a)  




Any increase or
decrease in the Net Asset Value of this FuturesAccess Fund, after
the deduction of all transaction costs and operating expenses, but
prior to accrual of the Management, Performance and Sponsor’s
Fees, during such Accounting Period shall be credited pro
rata , without any order or priority, among:  (i)
each Class of Units; and (ii) the Sponsor’s Capital Account,
if any, based in each case on the aggregate Opening Capital
Accounts attributable to each such Class of Units and the
Sponsor’s Capital Account; provided that any amounts received
by this FuturesAccess Fund from the Trading Advisor for payment to
the Sponsor shall be allocated to the Capital Account of the
Sponsor.  Extraordinary expenses shall be allocated as
the Sponsor may determine.






 







(b)  




If the Closing
Capital Account per Unit of any Class is reduced to zero, any
further decrease in the Net Asset Value per Unit shall be allocated
to the Sponsor’s Capital Account, if any.






 







(c)  




The Management
Fee, Performance Fee and Sponsor’s Fee shall be debited from
each Class, in each case after the Section 2.06(a) and
(b) allocations are made.






 







(d)  




The Net Assets
of each Class shall be divided equally among all Units of such
Class.






 


SECTION 2.07.
 
ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES FOR INCOME TAX
PURPOSES.


 







(a)  




A Tax Account
shall be established for each Unit of each Class.  The
Tax Accounts of all outstanding Units shall initially be equal to
each Unit’s net purchase price ( i.e ., the
subscription price for such Unit reduced by any sales commissions)
and shall subsequently be increased by such Unit’s share of
the taxable and tax-exempt income and gain of this FuturesAccess
Fund and decreased by such Unit’s share of the items of loss
or expense and nondeductible items of loss or expense of this
FuturesAccess Fund, as well as by any distributions.






 







(b)  




For federal
income tax purposes, items of ordinary income and loss, capital
gain and capital loss shall, unless the Sponsor believes that doing
so would not equitably reflect the economic experience of the
Units, be allocated as of December 31 of each year among the Units,
in the following order and priority:






 







(i)  




Items of
ordinary income and deduction generated by this FuturesAccess Fund
shall be allocated pro rata among the Units which were
outstanding during the months in such year when such items of
ordinary income and deduction accrued.

(ii)  




Gains will be
allocated FIRST, to Investors who have redeemed Units during such
year (including as of December 31), to the extent of the positive
difference (if any) between the amounts received or receivable upon
redemption and the respective Tax Account balances of the redeemed
Units.  SECOND, gains will be allocated to Investors to
the extent of the positive difference (if any) between the Capital
Account balance and the Tax Account balance attributable to their
remaining Units.  THIRD, gains will be allocated among
all Investors based on the respective Net Asset Values of their
outstanding Units.






 







(iii)  




Losses shall be
allocated FIRST, to Investors who have redeemed Units during such
year (including as of December 31), to the extent of the negative
difference (if any) between the amounts received or receivable upon
redemption and the respective Tax Account balances of the redeemed
Units.  SECOND, losses shall be allocated to Investors to
the extent of the negative difference (if any) between the Capital
Account balance and Tax Account balance attributable to their
remaining Units.  THIRD, losses shall be allocated among
all Investors based on the respective Net Asset Values of their
outstanding Units.






 







(iv)  




In the case of
each of the FIRST and SECOND allocation levels set forth in
Sections 2.07(b)(ii) and (iii) , if there is
insufficient gain or loss to make the complete allocation required
at such level, such allocation will be made pro rata among
all Investors who are subject to an allocation at such level in
accordance with the respective amounts which would have been
allocated had a complete allocation been possible.






 







(v)  




Management
Fees, Performance Fees and Sponsor’s Fees, as well as the
operating expenses (in each case as adjusted to reflect the
non-deductibility of all or a portion of such Sponsor’s Fees
and operating expenses) and extraordinary expenses, shall be
allocated, for tax purposes, to the Investors based on the amount
of the foregoing actually debited from the Units’ respective
Capital Accounts of the Investors’ respective
Units.






 







(vi)  




Items of
ordinary income and/or gain attributable to amounts received by
this FuturesAccess Fund from the Trading Advisor for payment to the
Sponsor shall be specially allocated to the Sponsor.






 







(c)  




The character
of items of income, gain, loss or deduction (ordinary, short-term
and long-term) and of the items required to be separately stated by
Section 702(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”), shall be allocated to the Investors
pursuant to this Section 2.07 so as equitably to reflect,
without discrimination or preference among Investors, the amounts
credited or debited to the Units’ respective Capital Accounts
pursuant to Section 2.06 .  Furthermore, to the
extent that this FuturesAccess Fund has a net long-term capital
gain or loss that may be subject to more than one maximum federal
income tax rate, allocations of such gain or loss shall be made pro
rata from among the amounts subject to each maximum tax
rate.






 







(d)  




In the case of
Units which are transferred during a fiscal year, the tax
allocations shall be made to such Units as provided
above.  The tax items so allocated will then be divided
among the transferor(s) and the transferee(s) based on the number
of months during such year that each held such Units, or in such
other manner as the Sponsor may deem equitable.






 







(e)  




Having in mind
the principles of the allocations set forth above in this
Section 2.07 (to which all Investors consent by becoming
Investors), the Sponsor may nevertheless make such allocations of
items of ordinary income and gain, ordinary deduction and loss and
any items required to be separately stated by Section 702(a) of the
Code as the Sponsor may deem fair and equitable — even if not
consistent with the foregoing allocations — in order to cause
the tax items allocated to the Investors, respectively, better to
take into account (as determined by the Sponsor) the Units’
respective Opening Capital Accounts and distributive shares of net
profit and net loss, any entry of new Investors, any redemptions,
any differences between income for tax purposes and for Net Asset
Value purposes, the differences between the Classes

of Units and
any other special circumstances which may arise; provided, however,
that no such allocation by the Sponsor shall discriminate unfairly
against any Investor; and provided further, that the Sponsor shall
be under no obligation whatsoever to deviate from the allocations
set forth above.






 








(f)  




This
FuturesAccess Fund may, to the extent practicable, allocate tax
items on a gross rather than a net basis.






 







(g)  




Allocations
pursuant to this Section 2.07 are solely for purposes of
federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect, or in any way
be taken into account in computing, any Unit’s Capital
Account or share of net profits, net losses or
distributions.






 







(h)  




The tax
allocations set forth in this Section 2.07 are intended to
allocate items of this FuturesAccess Fund’s income, gains,
losses and deductions (ordinary, short-term and long-term) in
accordance with Sections 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, and the
regulations thereunder, including, without limitation, the
requirements set forth therein regarding a “qualified income
offset.”






 







(i)  




The Sponsor may
make such modifications to this Agreement as the Sponsor believes
may be required to comply with Section 704 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder.






 







(j)  




In the event
that the Sponsor determines to issue a new Class of Units, the
foregoing tax allocations shall be adjusted so as equitably to
allocate tax items between or among the different
Classes.






 

SECTION 2.08.   CHARGEBACKS TO
CURRENT OR FORMER INVESTORS.  Each Investor, by
subscribing for Units, agrees to repay, despite the fact that such
Investor no longer remains an Investor, to this FuturesAccess Fund
any amount (including interest at the rate set by the Sponsor in
good faith from the date of any payment of redemption

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
