NEW  Skylite undersurface

The Moyes Skylite undersurface is a light weight clear laminate option now available on all RX Pro models.
The new undersurface layout offers the chance to introduce this ‘see through’ effect in the core of the wing.
The additional strength of the clear laminate brings along a firmer pitch response as well as a tighter sail core as compared to an all dacron version.
An all dacron undersurface in turn will retain the soft handling response the RX series is known for.

Niki Longshore blitzes the Gecko Challenge

			https://www.moyes.com.au/articles/articles-of-interest/376-niki-longshore-blitzed-the-gecko-challenge

12 July 2016 - Wharton, Texas. The morning skies promised another long day, another chance to claim the Gecko challenge. I had been trying repeatedly to get the 188 km task done and also break my personal record of 111 km, but each attempt ended half way or even less. I never let it get me down, but I was very eager to claim the challenge! Today was the day I would finally go the distance.

     Jerry & Vickie Moyes College of Education - Dream 125 Capital Campaign, Weber State University































Jerry & Vickie Moyes College of Education
Answering the Call for Energized Teachers, Strong Families and Healthy Lifestyles
When Weber Stake Academy opened in 1889, there were 59 upper-division students. Many of them dreamed of becoming educators. In fact, about 75 percent of all graduates during Weber’s early years planned to teach.
Today, the Jerry & Vickie Moyes College of Education serves more than 1,500 students each semester
        and offers a personalized approach to learning with nationally accredited programs in: 

Child and family
        studies
Health promotion and human performance
Teacher education 

In 1978, we introduced the university’s
        first graduate program; now, we offer master’s degrees in athletic training and curriculum and
        instruction.
Through the years, our distinctive teaching methods have captured attention and praise. From 1971, when
        the flexible WILKIT program received the Distinguished Achievement Award from the American Association of Colleges
        for Teacher Education, to 2012, when Online College Database ranked WSU among its top colleges for teacher
        education, we’ve demonstrated remarkable success in turning eager students into creative professionals.
    
Our athletic training program was named a 2012–13 Apple Distinguished Program because
        of its implementation of cutting-edge technology.
More than 90 percent of our graduates stay in Utah to positively impact our community
        and local economy.
Between 80 to 100 percent of Moyes College graduates find satisfying jobs soon after leaving WSU. Our graduates enjoy a 90-percent acceptance rate into master’s and Ph.D. programs, and that impressive statistic holds true for the percentage of Moyes College graduates who pass national certification exams. 
Our students work side by side with faculty mentors on groundbreaking research. Recently, four child
        and family studies professors partnered with the Department of
  Workforce Services to study intergenerational poverty in Utah with a focus on children.
Our award-winning
          Storytelling Festival is a community treasure that gives student-storytellers a chance to perform on
        stage with professionals. It is one of the few university-sponsored storytelling festivals in the nation.
Every year, our list of accomplishments grows longer and our dreams get bigger.
For 125 years, the Moyes College of Education has fueled student dreams. Inspirational
        faculty members connect with students on a personal level and know whether someone needs a nudge in
        the right direction or a pat on the back.
    
What We Can Accomplish Together
What we do at the Jerry & Vickie Moyes College of Education matters. We explore
        new ideas, seek new paths and embrace new opportunities. That includes
  collaborating with other groups, on campus and in the community, to bring the
  freshest, most innovative concepts to our students.
But every day we challenge ourselves, asking, “How can we be even better?”
    
That’s why we’re launching this comprehensive campaign, inviting alumni and friends to help us
        raise the bar in
our efforts to develop skilled teachers, trainers and practitioners, and support healthy, happy families.




Provide Opportunity

Scholarships
Without scholarships, many of our most
  promising students, especially nontraditional
  students with families to support and full-time
  jobs, could not afford the education that will
  boost their future earnings. With your help, we
  can fund scholarships that will
  allow deserving students from all walks of life to
  focus on their studies and take
advantage of priceless research opportunities.
“I was in my 40s, working as a teacher’s aide
  and playground monitor, when I took a leap
  of faith and went back to school. I don’t know what I would
  have done without TAPT. It paid for tuition, books and
sometimes gas for my truck — TAPT literally got me to school and to work.” — Mary PoVey ’12, Roy High School math resource teacher
Education Access
Mary PoVey is one of 120 former classroom
  aides who have taken advantage of our Teacher
  Assistant Pathway to Teaching (TAPT) program
to fulfill their dreams of becoming licensed teachers. TAPT was created in 1995 in response to
critical shortages of English as a Second Language
(ESL) and special education teachers in six Utah
school districts. It exists though the generosity of
private donors. With additional resources, we can
preserve and expand TAPT and other mission-related
programs, events and initiatives.
Internships and Community-based Research
Our students need
  hands-on internships and community-based
  research projects in addition to theory. Two
  outstanding professors from the Department
  of Health Promotion and Human Performance
were recently honored for their dedication to community-engaged learning. Your support
will allow the Moyes College to create new
opportunities for students to work in local
schools, clinics, businesses and organizations
where they can apply classroom knowledge in
relevant situations.




Advance Knowledge

WSU Charter Academy and Elementary
  School Partnership
Launched in 2013, the academy is the first charter school in
  Utah to be authorized through an institution
  of higher education. Creative faculty from
  multiple departments worked with students
  and community members to develop a
  unique kindergarten that emphasizes family
  involvement and developmentally appropriate
  curriculum. 
With Dream 125, we hope to
          partner with a local school district to create an
          elementary school that provides opportunities
          for high-risk students to succeed. This would
          also create additional teaching, learning and
          research opportunities for WSU faculty and pre-service
          teachers.
Boyd K. and Donna S. Packer Center for Family & Community Education Endowment
This center supports eight vital education
            outreach programs that serve families, teachers, students and community members:

Storytelling Festival
Teacher Assistant Pathway
            to Teaching (TAPT) 
WSU Charter Academy
Literacy
            Project
Families Alive Conference
Teachers of Tomorrow
Melba S. Lehner Children’s School
Care
            About Child Care

A fully funded endowment will provide the resources necessary to continue these essential
            outreach efforts.        
Faculty Development and Teacher-in-Residence Endowment
As enrollment soars and our programs grow, there’s an urgent need for well-qualified and diverse faculty.
            Endowed funds will give the Moyes College powerful tools to attract, retain and reward distinguished
            scholars and researchers. 
A teacher-in-residence program will bring
            public school teachers to campus to collaborate on projects and share their real-world expertise with
            aspiring educators. In return, the teachers will take new leadership skills and insight back to their
            classrooms.
Wellness Center
An interdisciplinary Wellness Center would give our health promotion and human performance students a
            world-class setting to develop their practical skills. With your support and the diverse expertise of
            our faculty, we can create a unique environment that maximizes hands-on learning.
Students will practice
            the latest exercise, sports training and physical therapy techniques. They will work with licensed therapists
            to design and supervise health and fitness programs for people struggling with chronic health
            conditions, diseases, psychological challenges and physical disabilities. The center would also provide
            a backdrop for student and faculty research.




Enhance Campus

Facility and Equipment Improvements
The cost of maintaining and upgrading these facilities to meet the demands of our growing student body
            is staggering. With your help, we can support student learning at the highest level. We can provide the modern buildings and tools our bright, tech-savvy students deserve,
            but our tight budgets don’t always allow.

                    Jerry and Vickie Moyes College of Education
                
TENURE DOCUMENT
Approved by Faculty Senate: April 16, 2009
Introduction 
The purpose of this document is to outline the criteria and the procedures used to evaluate faculty members for tenure in the Jerry and Vickie Moyes College of Education.
The normal probationary period for a faculty member in a tenure-track appointment is six years, with a formal interim review scheduled during the third year, and a formal, final tenure review scheduled during the sixth year. The time in rank for normal promotion from assistant to associate professor is six years. To be promoted from assistant to associate professor one must either have been granted tenure or be granted tenure at the same time as the promotion. A candidate who fails the tenure review process cannot be advanced in rank (see PPM 8.11).
Eligibility
To be eligible for tenure candidacy, individuals must:

Have a doctorate in the discipline of primary responsibility or a closely related discipline and be on a tenure track. The Jerry and Vickie Moyes College of Education does not recognize instructor specialist as a track leading to tenure in the college,  
Be in the third year of the probationary period for the interim review, and in the sixth year of the probationary period for the final tenure review, 
Meet the Standards of Professional Behaviors specified in PPM 9-4 through 9-8. 
Categories of Formal Review 
In order to assist and guide faculty members preparing for tenure evaluations, the competencies to be considered are in three categories:

Category I: Teaching
Category II: Scholarship
Category III: Administrative and/or Professionally Related Service
Competencies in categories I, II, and III are rated from unsatisfactory to excellent. 
Each committee and administrator in the review process will interpret information presented in terms of the 1) expectations of the department or college, 2) specific professional duties expected of the individual and 3) overall pattern of professional performance.
A written evaluation summary which includes the rationale for the ratings in each category will be submitted. The pattern of ratings must meet or exceed one of the channels described below:

The faculty member is responsible to update the professional file according to the dated guidelines of the review process (see PPM 8-12 and 8-13). The file should be organized by category and clearly document the candidates teaching, scholarship, and service activities. The candidate should include narrative summaries throughout the professional file. The candidate should create a support file for artifacts that are referenced in the narrative summaries as evidence, but which are not included in the professional file. 
Ratings
The ratings are to reflect the faculty member's academic career span rather than a single year’s efforts. The ratings mean that the evidence describing the quality and quantity of the individual's professional efforts support a continuing level of performance judged by the evaluators as unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good, or excellent. While the same rating channels are used for both the interim and final review, ratings assigned for a formal interim (3rd year) review reflect the committee’s judgment of the candidates work and progress towards tenure at that point and should be based on reasonable expectations for a third year faculty member. The interim review is expected to be formative in nature and both the ratings and the committee commentary should provide helpful feedback to the candidate as he/she evaluates priorities in preparation for the final tenure review. A candidate’s recent work at other institutions, while it may be taken into consideration, is not weighted as heavily as work at Weber State University. 
Unsatisfactory: This rating shall be given to a candidate who does not meet the minimum requirements of the satisfactory category.
Satisfactory: The candidate will be rated satisfactory if duties required of all faculty members are performed in an acceptable manner. Satisfactory means adequate and should not imply undesirable or below average endeavor.
Good: The candidate will be rated good if duties required of all faculty members are performed consistently in a more than satisfactory manner. Good implies commendable and desirable levels of achievement. A rating of good in any category implies a substantial degree of achievement above satisfactory levels.
Excellent: The candidate will be rated excellent if duties required of all faculty members are performed consistently in an outstanding manner. Inasmuch as a good rating in any category implies a substantial degree of achievement above satisfactory levels, a rating of excellent in any category implies a substantial degree of achievement above those considered appropriate for a good rating.
Definitions of Categories and Criteria
Category I: Teaching
Teaching is defined as the processes or behaviors related to organizing and delivering knowledge; evaluating and facilitating learning; and in general, transmitting content to students (see PPM 8-11.E).
Evidence of Teaching Includes: 

Subject matter mastery: depth and currency of knowledge.  
Curriculum development: new course development, ongoing course revisions, review and updating of syllabi and course materials.  
Course design: instructional goals and objectives, content coverage, adequate assessment methods.  
Delivery of instruction: methods (lecture, discussion, labs), skills (speaking, explaining), and aids (handouts, use of technology).  
Professional behavior: attendance at classes, appropriate preparation, prompt feedback and availability to students. 
Documentation of Performance in the Category of Teaching include student evaluations, faculty member’s teaching portfolio (profile), peer review, and other appropriate items of review that could potentially be used based upon identified teaching areas a – e.

Student Evaluations. Each department will obtain student evaluations from all courses taught by the faculty member each semester during the regular academic year. While the department is responsible for providing summaries of these evaluations to the individual, it is the candidate's responsibility to provide interpretation of the evaluations, and comment on areas of improvement and concern. 
Peer Review Committee Evaluation. A candidate’s peer review must be completed during the fall semester of the academic year prior to the year of the formal tenure evaluation (3rd or 6th year). The peer review committee will be appointed by October 1st of the peer review year by the department chair. The committee members will be chosen by the candidate in consultation with the chair. The peer review committee may be the department Ranking Tenure Review Committee (see PPM 8-15). If the peer review committee is not the department Ranking Tenure Review Committee then a minimum of three individuals who are familiar with the program will be selected. If the faculty member and the chair cannot agree on the makeup of the committee, the decision will be subject to binding arbitration by the dean.


The committee will review the faculty member’s teaching portfolio, observe several classroom sessions, interview several students from the classes observed, and submit a written report on teaching effectiveness to the professional file and the individual not later than December 15th. The written report of the peer review committee shall include, but not be limited to, a report on the individual's performance in the following areas: content mastery; quality and design of curriculum materials used and developed; evaluation policies and procedures utilized; availability to students; student supervision; maintenance of high academic standards; and personal commitment to improvement. The collection of data for the peer review is a continuous process and will extend over the total of the probationary period. The process of peer review is observational and descriptive rather than evaluative in nature, although the report may reach some formative conclusions.


Teaching Portfolio. The individual to be reviewed will develop a teaching portfolio. The portfolio should include a statement of teaching philosophy and artifacts for each teaching area (a-e) (see PPM 8-11.IV.E.2). Other things that might be included, if referenced in the professional file narrative summaries, are: examples of graded student work such as projects, presentations, evidence of assessment techniques such as exams, assignments, quizzes and rubrics; and syllabi. 
Clarification of Ratings for Teaching: A candidate shall be rated good (minimum rating in channels B, D, & E) if he/she are consistently rated by students and peers as good and if the candidate provides evidence addressing teaching areas a - e. 
Category II: Scholarship 
Scholarship is defined as those activities that contribute to the profession and increase the individual's effectiveness as a professor. While the faculty member is not expected to be equally active in all areas listed below prior to the sixth year review, the individual must submit evidence of significant professional activity. The evidence should indicate ongoing scholarly endeavors since arriving at Weber State University. The quality and quantity of effort and the results obtained are the standards of measurement.
Evidence of Scholarship Includes: 

Refereed publications, such as articles in refereed journals, articles in professional periodicals.  
Non-peer reviewed publications, such as books, book reviews, published monographs, or other professionally reviewed written material.  
Professional presentations, such as papers presented at international, national, regional, or state conferences or workshops. 
Projects, such as grants, action research, teaching innovations and developments, or other long-term professional associations with a public school, a service agency, or other field-based setting appropriate to the individual's discipline.  
Professional improvement, such as additional degrees beyond the terminal degree, formal post-graduate study, documentation of additional training, additional or increased expertise through self-study, conference attendance, development of new courses and/or programs, significant modifications to existing courses or programs,  
Other activities, which are appropriate to the category 
Clarification of Rating for Scholarship: A candidate shall be rated satisfactory (minimum rating in channels C and E) if he/she demonstrates a pattern of scholarly work which includes activities from a minimum of three areas. In order for the candidate to be rated “good” in this area, he/she must meet the requirements for a satisfactory rating and 

for the interim review, provide evidence of a regional and/or national refereed publication since employment began at Weber State University  
for the final tenure review, provide evidence of a regional and/or national refereed publication since the interim review. 
Category III: Administrative and/or Professionally Related Service
Professional service is defined as those activities which provide professionally related value to the community, the institution, or professional organizations. An individual is not expected to be equally active in all areas listed below. It is the candidate’s responsibility to provide evidence of successful administrative and/or professionally-related service. 
Evidence of Service Includes: 

Leadership positions in professional organizations. 
Membership in professional organizations. 
Professionally-related community activities such as speech making, or serving on community boards. 
Committee assignments at the department, college, or university levels. 
Service publications such as newsletters, newspaper and popular magazine articles, and media interviews. 
Service at professional conferences, workshops and seminars. 
Administrative assignments within the university. 
Student advisement activities or serving as an advisor to a student professional organization.  
Developmental activities which are service in nature, such as consulting.  
Other relevant professional service.
Clarification of Rating for Professionally Related Service: A candidate shall be rated satisfactory (minimum rating in channels A and D) if he/she accepts and performs in a professional manner duties in at least three areas (a – i), including at least one assignment in area d.
