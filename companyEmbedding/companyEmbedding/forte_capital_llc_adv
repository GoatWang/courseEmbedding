We can all probably agree: where Life Meets Money, there’s a lot going on.

Outside forces, economics, life changes and events—both predictable and unexpected—all have their effect.
Equally important are the emotions surrounding this intersection: excitement, confidence and curiosity but also sometimes add uncertainty, anxiety or doubt.
Our team’s goal is pretty simple: to be a valuable partner to you by deeply studying and carefully mapping the financial markets and the larger economic scene to the financial realities of your life situation. We are here to help you master your own unique balance of Good Life and Smart Money—as an individual, a commercial enterprise or a non-profit organization.

For Those Planning to Cut Back or Stop




You’re thinking about winding down at work.
You walked out of the staff meeting yesterday and started thinking “maybe it’s time?”


Retired DIY Investors




Realizing it’s more fun enjoying assets rather than managing them.
After 30 years of watching the market, you just want to relax and let someone else drive.



And Leisure Pros




Well into retirement—and loving it—but still future focused.
You want to live on the beach for 2 months next year, just for fun. Is that possible?

Hello Silver Tsunami! You are re-writing the book on retirement.
You’re informed about the economy and the global environment. And you’re hitting your stride professionally. But you are also starting to take note of what’s happening with elders in your family and your extended network of friends and acquaintances.
You’re the proud member of a demographic population bubble that’s changing all the rules. You don’t think of yourself as old. And why should you? You’re healthier than your parents were at this age. Your generation has a unique “whole person” attitude about the things you want in your life. And—having lived through some serious dips in the economy—you know how important planning can be.
You’re officially changing gears from accumulating assets to consuming. So, as a retired person, what do you need to evaluate your options?
Retirees have always been a significant part of the Forté client portfolio. 
We have a very concrete methodology for helping you create and manage the future you really want.

What are analysts saying about Pepsico stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Pepsico stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "PepsiCo reported second-quarter 2017 results with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.9% and 0.4%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, core earnings and revenues grew 10% and 2%, respectively, defying the difficult global macro industry slowdown. The upside was primarily driven by higher pricing, partly offsetting the weak demand. Revenues increased 3.1% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher demand in Latin America and Europe Sub-Saharan Africa. Notably, organic sales growth was higher than the 2.1% rise recorded in the previous quarter. The company also maintained its 2017 core EPS growth rate of 8% on 3% top-line growth, partly offset by 2% FX headwind for both EPS and revenues, echoing the ongoing macro challenges outside the U.S. Despite challenges, Pepsi has been doing well on the back of major innovation, ongoing revenue management strategies, improved productivity and better market execution." (7/14/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "We continue to recommend PEP following solid 4Q results. Despite the difficult global macro, the co. delivered 4% org sales and 12% core FX neutral EPS growth in FY16, which places it toward the higher end of CPG peers. Margins, FCF conversion, and ROIC all continue to improve, and PEP's initial FY17 EPS guide looks conservative (we see up to 4 pts of upside). At 19x EV/ULFCF, we see scope to re-rate vs. KO/MDLZ avg. of 25x' Solid 4Q, FY17 guide looks conservative: PEP's $1.20 in 4Q EPS came in $0.04 ahead of Street est. on in-line topline (3.7% org sales vs. Street 3.8%) and -80 bps of GM % contraction, offset by better SG&A (40.5% vs. Street 41.7%)."

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
