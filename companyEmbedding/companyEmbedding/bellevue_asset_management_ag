With that date on the horizon, it is more than fitting that the team under Dr. Cyrill Zimmermann, Head of Healthcare Funds & Mandates at Bellevue Asset Management, has launched a corresponding investment fund governed by Luxembourg law. The BB Adamant Healthcare Index (Lux) Fund (ISIN B-USD LU1477742909) was registered for public distribution in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg end of 2016. The Adamant Global Healthcare Index was created in April 2007 to capture the attractive prospects that the global healthcare market offers to investors. The index is composed of the forty most attractive healthcare stocks in the global universe. It is reviewed every six months in April and October and adjusted if necessary. Since inception, the index has produced an excess return of 153% relative to the MSCI World Index and of 98% relative to the MSCI World Health Care Index. The absolute performance since inception - measured in USD - is 188%. The success of the Adamant Healthcare Index led to the 2011 launch of a Swiss investment fund for institutional investors that replicates the index. This Swiss fund is now being followed by a Luxembourg-based fund that has been approved for sale to retail investors in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Luxembourg. All growth segments in one fund  With new drug approvals holding steady at high levels and a flurry of innovation coming from the medtech and services sub-sectors, the healthcare sector's long-term growth potential is secure and investors can participate in that potential through this fund. For Dr. Cyrill Zimmermann, this new fund represents another major step in the development of Bellevue Asset Management's range of healthcare investment products: "A growing number of investors had asked us to offer an index product outside Switzerland too. Those requests have now been met with the launch of the BB Adamant Healthcare Index (Lux) Fund. This is an important addition to our diverse range of sound investment solutions. The fund effectively covers all of the high growth segments within the promising healthcare industry on a global scale." The BB Adamant Healthcare Team continuously screens about 600 of the 3,000 listed companies in the healthcare sector based on 8 criteria. Four quantitative and four qualitative parameters are applied. The qualitative parameters measure the quality and track record of a company's management team, product pipeline and operating risks as well as country-related risks while the quantitative parameters provide information on stock valuations. There are four regions, Western Europe, North America, Japan/Australia and Emerging Markets, and the index is composed of the ten best stocks from each region. The region with the highest overall score, usually North America, can have a maximum index weighting of 35% when the index is rebalanced, so this index puts more emphasis on emerging markets. Companies with high valuations and low growth rates are rarely in the index. Historical index data shows that mid-cap stocks have typically represented 60% to 80% of the index and the Asia region has accounted for about one-third of the index. Furthermore, conventional pharma stocks are clearly underweighted compared to their weighting on the MSCI World Health Care Index, the standard sector benchmark.

Huber will acquire an interest in Bellevue Group Bellevue Group intends to acquire 100% of StarCapital, an independent asset manager based in Oberursel, near Frankfurt/Main. This acquisition is subject to approval by the Swiss and German regulatory authorities FINMA and BaFin as well as to additional terms and conditions customary for such transactions. The acquisition encompasses the firm`s entire range of investment funds with total client assets of approximately CHF 2.5 bn as of December 31, 2015 and all of its 16 employees.Through this acquisition Bellevue Group is deliberately diversifying into new asset classes and expanding its offering of non-healthcare investment solutions. Bellevue Group`s investment competence was previously focused on sector and regional strategies while StarCapital`s investment solutions consisted of bond, equity and wealth management funds as well as ETF strategies. There is no overlap between the two product ranges; they are ideally complementary. StarCapital will continue to operate as an independent company and retain its brand name as well as its current employees. It is expected to profit from a stronger operating position after the transaction closes.Peter E. Huber, StarCapital AG Partner and Fund Manager: "With Bellevue Group we have found a competent partner with a renowned international profile who can lead StarCapital to future success in a changing market environment. Bellevue Asset Management`s business model creates attractive growth opportunities for StarCapital in Switzerland and beyond." The StarCapital funds will continue to be managed by their current managers using their time-tested investment process. Peter E. Huber will continue to manage the equity, bond and wealth management funds and Markus Kaiser will be responsible for the ETF strategies. Capital market research, an important tool of the fund management company, will remain the responsibility of Norbert Keimling.André Rüegg, CEO of Bellevue Group: "StarCapital represents an ideal expansion of our investment expertise and market presence. With StarCapital`s wealth management funds, we can offer our clients first-class multi-asset and flexible equity and fixed-income solutions. Peter E. Huber, who has played a pivotal role in shaping and growing StarCapital, is recognized as one of Germany`s most experienced asset managers. This acquisition enhances our presence in Germany and our access to this key European market. Expansion into new asset classes and the enlargement of our investment product range beyond the healthcare sector will further diversify Bellevue Asset Management`s income base and boost recurring income."The purchase agreement includes a symmetrical price adjustment mechanism based on StarCapital`s average net profit for the fiscal years 2016-2018. Bellevue Group is expecting the acquisition to be immediately value accretive for all shareholders. Bellevue Group`s dividend policy of payouts from operating cash flows will remain unchanged after the acquisition.Capital increase through rights offering plannedIn order to move ahead with the planned acquisition of StarCapital and to retain Bellevue Group`s strategic flexibility in the pursuit of its forward strategy, a capital increase via rights issue in the amount of CHF 30-40 mn is planned for the second quarter of 2016. The Board of Directors of Bellevue Group will submit a motion to increase authorized share capital at the Annual General Meeting on March 22, 2016.The founding shareholders support the proposed capital increase and have expressed their intention to exercise a substantial amount of their subscription rights. It is also planned that Peter E. Huber will purchase a stake in Bellevue Group AG. Details regarding the proposed motion of the Board of Directors will be included with the official invitation to the Annual General Meeting.Consolidated results for fiscal year 2015 will be published on February 29, 2016.Contact:Media Relations:Jürg Stähelin, IRF Communications,Telephone +41 43 244 81 51, juerg.staehelin@irfcom.chInvestor Relations: Daniel Koller, CFO Bellevue Group                                        Read MoreTelephone +41 44 267 67 00, ir@bellevue.chContact StarCapital:Holger H.
