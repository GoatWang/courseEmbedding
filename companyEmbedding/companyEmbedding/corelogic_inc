"I am proud to work at a company where I am able to move around and try new things."
Joann
Customer Service Representative
I have been able to take advantage of the CoreLogic Mentorship Program. Through the program, I have been able to evaluate a number of different types of jobs throughout the company. It has been invaluable to find out what types of other jobs are out there and if they might be a fit for me. I am proud to work at company where I am able to move around and try new things. Overall, I would say CoreLogic represents growth - in a matter of months I was given the opportunity to broaden my experience by working in another department. If I were to give advice for people considering working here I would say, "be yourself, come in with an open mind, ready to work hard with lots of determination and you will grow professionally. It's a fantastic opportunity."


"If you get the chance to work at CoreLogic, go for it! You will get the opportunity to use the best technology, as well as work with the smartest people in the universe."
Ann
VP Database Management
I came to CoreLogic ten years ago, because CoreLogic was one of the most cutting-edge companies and best places to work. And it still is today. My team works to deliver data at high speeds; we leverage data to make it useful for our customers. We make information meaningful. Our teams are always looking for the latest developments in the industry; we work collaboratively to share knowledge to stay in the lead. Each day, we ask "how?" How will we build the next great product using this repository of data? How are we going to continue to make it meaningful, in a world that's dynamic and ever-changing? We create the best technology, blending layers of data to create solutions every day. CoreLogic is successful because of the very strong talent base that makes up the company. We leverage people here; we are always looking for people that can think independently. People who work here are not only intelligent but also possess curiosity and a sense of wonder, and independent thinking to formulate that next innovative solution.


"I love knowing that my work is allowing people to rest easy because their property taxes are in safe hands."
Richard
Tax Researcher
I work in the Outsourcing department and am responsible for paying taxes for our client escrow loan holders, as well as researching missing or misapplied payments. My job keeps me on my toes; there are no two tasks alike. My job gives me a unique sense of satisfaction. I love knowing that my work is allowing people to rest easy because their property taxes are in safe hands. The best part about working at CoreLogic is the team spirit and camaraderie. It is well known that hard work pays off here. Achievement is not only acknowledged but also rewarded by programs such as the Kennedy Excellence Award.


"It is really exciting to see what the future will bring for this company."
Kevin
Director of Finance
I oversee the day to day finance operations for the Data & Analytics division. Our department plays a key role in the financial planning and analysis of the business unit we support. We pride ourselves in trying to find solutions to any challenges or obstacles the business may encounter. We have a diverse team with vast talent. We like to provide assistance in many areas even if it means working outside of our typical scope. CoreLogic has a diverse mix of legacy talents and intellectual property along with cutting edge technology and analytics. It is really exciting to see what the future will bring for this company.

History[edit]
CoreLogic dates back to September 1991, when TRW Real Estate Information Services entered into a partnership with three real estate information service units from Elsevier, the Dutch Publishing company now known as Reed Elsevier.[7] In September 1996, the group, by then known as TRW Information Systems & Services, was spun off and renamed Experian.[8]
In September 1997, majority ownership of Experian's real estate information business was acquired by The First American Corporation, in a partnership with Experian.[9] The partnership was called FARES LLC, and the new entity began operating under the name First American Real Estate Solutions (RES).[10]
Also in 1997, Kraig Clark and Steve Schroeder co-founded C&S Marketing in Sacramento, CA.[11] Created to provide fraud prevention and collateral risk management solutions to the mortgage banking industry, the company was later renamed as CoreLogic Systems.
In October 2003, First American RES acquired Transamerica's property information business, combining their real estate information and analytics businesses.[12]
In March 2007, First American Corporation merged its First American RES subsidiary with CoreLogic Systems, under the FARES LLC subsidiary.[13] The division began operating under the name First American CoreLogic.[14]
In June 2010, CoreLogic, Inc. was established as a standalone business when The First American Corporation split its businesses to create two separate legal entities, CoreLogic, Inc and First American Corporation which provides title and financial services.[15]
In January 2011, the company acquired Australia-RP Data, a provider of residential and commercial property information in Australia and New Zealand, for $194 million.[16]
In March 2011, CoreLogic acquired Dorado Network Systems Corp, a San Mateo-CA based cloud application and architecture development company servicing the financial services industry.[17]
In July 2011, the company sold its CoreLogic India operations to US IT company Cognizant, for $50 million. AS part of the transaction, the companies also announced five year, $324 million services agreement.[18]
In January 2013 CoreLogic bought Middletown, CT-based CDS Business mapping, a provider of geospatial hazard reports including distance to coast, flood zones, rating territories, proximity to brush, wind pool eligibility and earthquake information. CoreLogic reported it would integrate the business into its existing Spatial Solutions business.[19]
In April 2013, CoreLogic bought Case-Schiller, the producers of the Case-Shiller home price index, known as one of the most important measures of the health of the housing market.[20]
In December 2013, CoreLogic acquired catastrophic modeling firm Eqecat from Texas-based ABS Group.[21]
In March 2014, CoreLogic acquired Marshall & Swift/Boeckh, a Milwaukee, WI-based provider of building cost information, residential and commercial analytics and business management services, San Diego, CA-based DataQuick Information Systems, a property data and analytics information company, and the credit and flood services operations of DataQuick Lending Solutions. The three acquired units were part of TPG Capital's Decision Insight Information Group.[22]
In June 2014, CoreLogic expanded its hail, wind and lightning weather risk-management capabilities by acquiring Weather Fusion,[23] formerly known as livehailmap.com.[24]
In August 2015, the company purchased LandSafe Appraisal Services, an appraisal management company, from Bank of America for $122 million.[25]
In October 2015, CoreLogic acquired Australian construction data business Cordell from Europe media group RELX, formerly known as Reed Elsevier.[26]
In December 2015, the company acquired FNC, Inc., another provider of real estate appraisal services, for $475 million.[25]
In January 2016, CoreLogic announced it was paying $65M to acquire total ownership of RELS, LLC, a provider of property valuation and appraisal services it owned in partnership with Wells Fargo.[25]
In March 2017, CEO Nallathambi died shortly after taking medical leave from the company.[27] Shortly thereafter, the company announced Frank Martell as its new President and CEO.[28]
Business segments[edit]
CoreLogic's operations are divided into two segments: Data and Analytics, and Technology and Processing Solutions.[29]
Data and analytics[edit]
The D&A group acquires and links property, mortgage and financial data using models and algorithms to produce analytics for clients. Services include advisory services, automated valuations, location intelligence, multiple listing technology and platforms, mortgage fraud management, property information and analytics, and rental screening and analytics.[29]
Technology processing solutions[edit]
The TPS group provides mortgage-related data services for mortgage lenders and servicers. Services and technology include flood data services, property tax services, credit verification services, underbanked credit services, compliance and management services, mortgage origination technology, and business process outsourcing and cloud computing-based mortgage servicing solutions.[29]
Reports[edit]
CoreLogic releases reports to the real estate and mortgage industries:

Equity Report - a report showing the distribution of equity across all single-family homes in the US with a mortgage.[30] This report initially debuted as a "Negative Equity Report" highlighting how many homeowners were underwater on their mortgage.[31]
National Foreclosure Report - a monthly report showing the foreclosure inventory and the number of completed foreclosures, which is an indication of the total number of homes actually lost to foreclosure.[32]
The MarketPulse - a monthly report offering insight into the current and future health of the U.S. economic climate with particular focus on housing and mortgage metrics.[33]

Data sources[edit]
Data is the core of many of CoreLogic's products, analytics and services. The data includes real property information, mortgage information and consumer information. Data sources include public sources, data contributed by company clients, and data obtained from data aggregators.[1]
Public data sources include data and documents from federal, state and local governments. This information is augmented by data from other public and non-public sources, allowing the identification of physical property characteristics, boundaries and tax values, current and historical ownership, voluntary and involuntary liens, tax assessments and delinquencies, replacement cost, property risk including environmental, flood and hazard information, criminal data, building permits, local trends, summary statistics and household demographics.
Client contributed data includes loan performance information (from loan servicers, trustees, securitizers, issuers and others), mortgage, auto, property rental and under-banked loan applications from various loan originators, landlords and property owners.
Data acquired from aggregators includes property listing and tenant/landlord rental information from Boards of Realtors, real estate agents, brokers, landlords, and owners of multi-tenant properties. The company also collects appraisals and property valuations from appraisers, and licenses consumer credit history information from credit reporting agencies, lenders and auto dealers.

History[edit]
CoreLogic dates back to September 1991, when TRW Real Estate Information Services entered into a partnership with three real estate information service units from Elsevier, the Dutch Publishing company now known as Reed Elsevier.[7] In September 1996, the group, by then known as TRW Information Systems & Services, was spun off and renamed Experian.[8]
In September 1997, majority ownership of Experian's real estate information business was acquired by The First American Corporation, in a partnership with Experian.[9] The partnership was called FARES LLC, and the new entity began operating under the name First American Real Estate Solutions (RES).[10]
Also in 1997, Kraig Clark and Steve Schroeder co-founded C&S Marketing in Sacramento, CA.[11] Created to provide fraud prevention and collateral risk management solutions to the mortgage banking industry, the company was later renamed as CoreLogic Systems.
In October 2003, First American RES acquired Transamerica's property information business, combining their real estate information and analytics businesses.[12]
In March 2007, First American Corporation merged its First American RES subsidiary with CoreLogic Systems, under the FARES LLC subsidiary.[13] The division began operating under the name First American CoreLogic.[14]
In June 2010, CoreLogic, Inc. was established as a standalone business when The First American Corporation split its businesses to create two separate legal entities, CoreLogic, Inc and First American Corporation which provides title and financial services.[15]
In January 2011, the company acquired Australia-RP Data, a provider of residential and commercial property information in Australia and New Zealand, for $194 million.[16]
In March 2011, CoreLogic acquired Dorado Network Systems Corp, a San Mateo-CA based cloud application and architecture development company servicing the financial services industry.[17]
In July 2011, the company sold its CoreLogic India operations to US IT company Cognizant, for $50 million. AS part of the transaction, the companies also announced five year, $324 million services agreement.[18]
In January 2013 CoreLogic bought Middletown, CT-based CDS Business mapping, a provider of geospatial hazard reports including distance to coast, flood zones, rating territories, proximity to brush, wind pool eligibility and earthquake information. CoreLogic reported it would integrate the business into its existing Spatial Solutions business.[19]
In April 2013, CoreLogic bought Case-Schiller, the producers of the Case-Shiller home price index, known as one of the most important measures of the health of the housing market.[20]
In December 2013, CoreLogic acquired catastrophic modeling firm Eqecat from Texas-based ABS Group.[21]
In March 2014, CoreLogic acquired Marshall & Swift/Boeckh, a Milwaukee, WI-based provider of building cost information, residential and commercial analytics and business management services, San Diego, CA-based DataQuick Information Systems, a property data and analytics information company, and the credit and flood services operations of DataQuick Lending Solutions. The three acquired units were part of TPG Capital's Decision Insight Information Group.[22]
In June 2014, CoreLogic expanded its hail, wind and lightning weather risk-management capabilities by acquiring Weather Fusion,[23] formerly known as livehailmap.com.[24]
In August 2015, the company purchased LandSafe Appraisal Services, an appraisal management company, from Bank of America for $122 million.[25]
In October 2015, CoreLogic acquired Australian construction data business Cordell from Europe media group RELX, formerly known as Reed Elsevier.[26]
In December 2015, the company acquired FNC, Inc., another provider of real estate appraisal services, for $475 million.[25]
In January 2016, CoreLogic announced it was paying $65M to acquire total ownership of RELS, LLC, a provider of property valuation and appraisal services it owned in partnership with Wells Fargo.[25]
In March 2017, CEO Nallathambi died shortly after taking medical leave from the company.[27] Shortly thereafter, the company announced Frank Martell as its new President and CEO.[28]
Business segments[edit]
CoreLogic's operations are divided into two segments: Data and Analytics, and Technology and Processing Solutions.[29]
Data and analytics[edit]
The D&A group acquires and links property, mortgage and financial data using models and algorithms to produce analytics for clients. Services include advisory services, automated valuations, location intelligence, multiple listing technology and platforms, mortgage fraud management, property information and analytics, and rental screening and analytics.[29]
Technology processing solutions[edit]
The TPS group provides mortgage-related data services for mortgage lenders and servicers. Services and technology include flood data services, property tax services, credit verification services, underbanked credit services, compliance and management services, mortgage origination technology, and business process outsourcing and cloud computing-based mortgage servicing solutions.[29]
Reports[edit]
CoreLogic releases reports to the real estate and mortgage industries:

Equity Report - a report showing the distribution of equity across all single-family homes in the US with a mortgage.[30] This report initially debuted as a "Negative Equity Report" highlighting how many homeowners were underwater on their mortgage.[31]
National Foreclosure Report - a monthly report showing the foreclosure inventory and the number of completed foreclosures, which is an indication of the total number of homes actually lost to foreclosure.[32]
The MarketPulse - a monthly report offering insight into the current and future health of the U.S. economic climate with particular focus on housing and mortgage metrics.[33]

Data sources[edit]
Data is the core of many of CoreLogic's products, analytics and services. The data includes real property information, mortgage information and consumer information. Data sources include public sources, data contributed by company clients, and data obtained from data aggregators.[1]
Public data sources include data and documents from federal, state and local governments. This information is augmented by data from other public and non-public sources, allowing the identification of physical property characteristics, boundaries and tax values, current and historical ownership, voluntary and involuntary liens, tax assessments and delinquencies, replacement cost, property risk including environmental, flood and hazard information, criminal data, building permits, local trends, summary statistics and household demographics.
Client contributed data includes loan performance information (from loan servicers, trustees, securitizers, issuers and others), mortgage, auto, property rental and under-banked loan applications from various loan originators, landlords and property owners.
Data acquired from aggregators includes property listing and tenant/landlord rental information from Boards of Realtors, real estate agents, brokers, landlords, and owners of multi-tenant properties. The company also collects appraisals and property valuations from appraisers, and licenses consumer credit history information from credit reporting agencies, lenders and auto dealers.

Data is the core of many of CoreLogic's products, analytics and services. The data includes real property information, mortgage information and consumer information. Data sources include public sources, data contributed by company clients, and data obtained from data aggregators.[1]
Public data sources include data and documents from federal, state and local governments. This information is augmented by data from other public and non-public sources, allowing the identification of physical property characteristics, boundaries and tax values, current and historical ownership, voluntary and involuntary liens, tax assessments and delinquencies, replacement cost, property risk including environmental, flood and hazard information, criminal data, building permits, local trends, summary statistics and household demographics.
Client contributed data includes loan performance information (from loan servicers, trustees, securitizers, issuers and others), mortgage, auto, property rental and under-banked loan applications from various loan originators, landlords and property owners.
Data acquired from aggregators includes property listing and tenant/landlord rental information from Boards of Realtors, real estate agents, brokers, landlords, and owners of multi-tenant properties. The company also collects appraisals and property valuations from appraisers, and licenses consumer credit history information from credit reporting agencies, lenders and auto dealers.

History[edit]
CoreLogic dates back to September 1991, when TRW Real Estate Information Services entered into a partnership with three real estate information service units from Elsevier, the Dutch Publishing company now known as Reed Elsevier.[7] In September 1996, the group, by then known as TRW Information Systems & Services, was spun off and renamed Experian.[8]
In September 1997, majority ownership of Experian's real estate information business was acquired by The First American Corporation, in a partnership with Experian.[9] The partnership was called FARES LLC, and the new entity began operating under the name First American Real Estate Solutions (RES).[10]
Also in 1997, Kraig Clark and Steve Schroeder co-founded C&S Marketing in Sacramento, CA.[11] Created to provide fraud prevention and collateral risk management solutions to the mortgage banking industry, the company was later renamed as CoreLogic Systems.
In October 2003, First American RES acquired Transamerica's property information business, combining their real estate information and analytics businesses.[12]
In March 2007, First American Corporation merged its First American RES subsidiary with CoreLogic Systems, under the FARES LLC subsidiary.[13] The division began operating under the name First American CoreLogic.[14]
In June 2010, CoreLogic, Inc. was established as a standalone business when The First American Corporation split its businesses to create two separate legal entities, CoreLogic, Inc and First American Corporation which provides title and financial services.[15]
In January 2011, the company acquired Australia-RP Data, a provider of residential and commercial property information in Australia and New Zealand, for $194 million.[16]
In March 2011, CoreLogic acquired Dorado Network Systems Corp, a San Mateo-CA based cloud application and architecture development company servicing the financial services industry.[17]
In July 2011, the company sold its CoreLogic India operations to US IT company Cognizant, for $50 million. AS part of the transaction, the companies also announced five year, $324 million services agreement.[18]
In January 2013 CoreLogic bought Middletown, CT-based CDS Business mapping, a provider of geospatial hazard reports including distance to coast, flood zones, rating territories, proximity to brush, wind pool eligibility and earthquake information. CoreLogic reported it would integrate the business into its existing Spatial Solutions business.[19]
In April 2013, CoreLogic bought Case-Schiller, the producers of the Case-Shiller home price index, known as one of the most important measures of the health of the housing market.[20]
In December 2013, CoreLogic acquired catastrophic modeling firm Eqecat from Texas-based ABS Group.[21]
In March 2014, CoreLogic acquired Marshall & Swift/Boeckh, a Milwaukee, WI-based provider of building cost information, residential and commercial analytics and business management services, San Diego, CA-based DataQuick Information Systems, a property data and analytics information company, and the credit and flood services operations of DataQuick Lending Solutions. The three acquired units were part of TPG Capital's Decision Insight Information Group.[22]
In June 2014, CoreLogic expanded its hail, wind and lightning weather risk-management capabilities by acquiring Weather Fusion,[23] formerly known as livehailmap.com.[24]
In August 2015, the company purchased LandSafe Appraisal Services, an appraisal management company, from Bank of America for $122 million.[25]
In October 2015, CoreLogic acquired Australian construction data business Cordell from Europe media group RELX, formerly known as Reed Elsevier.[26]
In December 2015, the company acquired FNC, Inc., another provider of real estate appraisal services, for $475 million.[25]
In January 2016, CoreLogic announced it was paying $65M to acquire total ownership of RELS, LLC, a provider of property valuation and appraisal services it owned in partnership with Wells Fargo.[25]
In March 2017, CEO Nallathambi died shortly after taking medical leave from the company.[27] Shortly thereafter, the company announced Frank Martell as its new President and CEO.[28]
Business segments[edit]
CoreLogic's operations are divided into two segments: Data and Analytics, and Technology and Processing Solutions.[29]
Data and analytics[edit]
The D&A group acquires and links property, mortgage and financial data using models and algorithms to produce analytics for clients. Services include advisory services, automated valuations, location intelligence, multiple listing technology and platforms, mortgage fraud management, property information and analytics, and rental screening and analytics.[29]
Technology processing solutions[edit]
The TPS group provides mortgage-related data services for mortgage lenders and servicers. Services and technology include flood data services, property tax services, credit verification services, underbanked credit services, compliance and management services, mortgage origination technology, and business process outsourcing and cloud computing-based mortgage servicing solutions.[29]
Reports[edit]
CoreLogic releases reports to the real estate and mortgage industries:

Equity Report - a report showing the distribution of equity across all single-family homes in the US with a mortgage.[30] This report initially debuted as a "Negative Equity Report" highlighting how many homeowners were underwater on their mortgage.[31]
National Foreclosure Report - a monthly report showing the foreclosure inventory and the number of completed foreclosures, which is an indication of the total number of homes actually lost to foreclosure.[32]
The MarketPulse - a monthly report offering insight into the current and future health of the U.S. economic climate with particular focus on housing and mortgage metrics.[33]

Data sources[edit]
Data is the core of many of CoreLogic's products, analytics and services. The data includes real property information, mortgage information and consumer information. Data sources include public sources, data contributed by company clients, and data obtained from data aggregators.[1]
Public data sources include data and documents from federal, state and local governments. This information is augmented by data from other public and non-public sources, allowing the identification of physical property characteristics, boundaries and tax values, current and historical ownership, voluntary and involuntary liens, tax assessments and delinquencies, replacement cost, property risk including environmental, flood and hazard information, criminal data, building permits, local trends, summary statistics and household demographics.
Client contributed data includes loan performance information (from loan servicers, trustees, securitizers, issuers and others), mortgage, auto, property rental and under-banked loan applications from various loan originators, landlords and property owners.
Data acquired from aggregators includes property listing and tenant/landlord rental information from Boards of Realtors, real estate agents, brokers, landlords, and owners of multi-tenant properties. The company also collects appraisals and property valuations from appraisers, and licenses consumer credit history information from credit reporting agencies, lenders and auto dealers.
