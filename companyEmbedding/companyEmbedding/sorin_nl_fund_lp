      disciplines of credit sensitive investing.”


“Sorin presents a unique opportunity to join a 
      real estate-focused hedge fund with the ability to invest across all 
      sectors, both public and private, at a time when a multifaceted team is 
      crucial in order to capitalize on opportunities in this evolving credit 
      cycle,” said Mr. DiDonato. “I 
      look forward to building on the firm’s 
      already impressive track record.”


      Before joining Sorin, Mr. DiDonato was President and Chief Investment 
      Officer of Capmark Investments, L.P., a global real estate fund manager 
      with over $10 billion of real estate debt and equity investments. Mr.
