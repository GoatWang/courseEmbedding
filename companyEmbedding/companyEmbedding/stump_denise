            Does this contain Potassium Nitrate?
        


Asked by: Will

            Yes, it is an oxidizer that causes the stump to decay over about a six week period.

            will it work on a scrub stump that has sprouted tiny leaves
        

            If it won't, what product will? My son will be removing it for me!
        
Asked by: Andi

            No. Kill the stump with concentrated Roundup, undiluted.

            Will it break down stumps that have new tree grown out of them?
        

            Tree was cut down almost 6 years ago but there has continuously been branch growth from the stump that gets very bushy and large each year. I trim it down all the time but keeps coming back. Can I use this product? And can it be done without actually burning the tree stump? We'd like to soften the wood before trying to use an axe on it. It seems very hard. BTW: It was a Norway Maple really big one.

Thanks.
        
Asked by: Dolly

            It should. It is an oxidizer that accelerates decay, but it will take about six weeks, and breaks down the stump slowly.

            How long after the tree is cut down do I wait before using the spectracide?
        

            How long after the tree is cut down do I wait before using the spectracide?
        
Asked by: Tree

            No need to wait at all. Just drill the holes on sides and top of stump, pour in the granules, douse with warm water for a couple of days. Then wait, may 6 to 12 weeks.

This product is a wast of time and money. I used it almost three months ago on a 6 inch stump and it has not done anything to the stump!!!  Would love to give it less than a one star rating.

Bottle is designed to ease the application of the product as directed. You must drill holes in the stumps for proper application. I applied this to two stumps @ 2-months ago and will re-apply it this weekend. So far, no dramatic visible effects on either of the stumps. Hopefully the re-application will move the process along a bit faster. So far I'm not overwhelmed with the effectiveness.

It's odd to see that the instructions on the label are a bit biased on the usage of the product. The proper way to remove a stump is to drill a 2" center hole into the stump. Intimately mix together 3 parts stump remover and 2 parts sugar, and pour into the hole.  This method produces volumes of smoke, however it does reduce the stump into a manageable task within an hour.

        TOO SLOW
I bought 10 units of this product. I have 30+ small stumps. I am a bit disappointed. After reading small print. It seems I'll be dead when the stumps are gone. (Im 55 yrs old) I then read a review from the past. Said "10 yrs and stump was gone." That puts me at 65 yrs old! Good grief Charlie Brown!!! I want something to destroy the stumps. I'm putting in a moble home. So the product purchased although I am using it. I'm going to have to get a stump grinder. Or some acid. And get it done RIGHT!!!

        This stuff works well just not quickly and understandably so.
I live on a forest floor. from time to time i have to take down a tree or two. Stumps will sprout and its a mess when they do. I have been using stump remover for about 20 years and have learned how to apply so that it is very effective. The stumps when treated like i am going to share will not sprout and will die...a slow death.

Immediately after I take the tree down(that day). I take a big drill with half inch spade bit and drill holes about inch close to the edge of the tree all around spaced about an inch and a half. Then I take a 1/8 spade bit and drill outside into each hole at a angle. Making a V. The holes allow water to exit but allow the powder to stay in contact long as possible as root system picks it up.

So I use my blower to clean all the wood chips out of the holes. Then add water to the stump. Then take the stump remover and fill the holes in the circle leave the outside holes alone. According to the weather ie if heavy rain is expected i will cover the top of the stump and remove cover when rain goes to light.

I mess with it for about 10 days. keeping the holes from getting drenched for that time allows the root system to absorb the stump remover. After that time the holes are ready to do the work on their own without you paying any more attention to it. It a done deal stumps are done for. I moved some leaves today and found a stump from 4 years ago it was like a shrunken head. It will be easy to pull out. Root system is dead too.
