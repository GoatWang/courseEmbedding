I have been adding pieces to my collection for over a year now...Love them! However, I would also like to request various size saucepans so I too can get rid of my ceramic ones and replace with Copper Chef. Wish you would have a waffle maker as well.

I saw these on TV and finally got them from Amazon and I couldn't believe I baked bacon in the crisper unbelievable taste and had eggs that were out of this world. I then bought the big pan today and told everyone I've talked to they must buy these pans. Just wish you had smaller sauce pan and I would throw away everything else I had. Amazing.

I love the Copper Chef products!!!  They really are amazing, I just wish there was a 2qt & 3qt sauce pans - I would buy them immediately!   If or when they are available please email me.   (Even a 1qt sauce pan would be useful as well).  I would purchase them all- these products are wonderful, cook evenly, clean up is a snap, look appealing, no oils needed just as advertised.

This pan is unbelievable!!! I work a lot, and the last thing I want to do is wash a lot of dishes. The clean up is so quick! Nothing sticks to it, so I don't have to soak it for a century!

Never expected to love this set as much as I do. I'm going to tell you I was VERY skeptical about this purchase, i mean, come on, it was an infomercial, yaddy yadda da! I use  this everyday, and it's the best set I have ever owned. I love how easy they are to clean and when they say you can wipe it right out, it's the truth. The induction cook top,is FANTASTIC, I haven't used my stove top since receiving them. I can wait for new products. They've got me hooked.

The new Crisper is a great Idea for a 2 person family, but larger ones, you would need 2 of them. I would love to hear you are coming out with a larger "Crisper".  A larger one would work better for my family. Copper chef is a great product. Love the stuff I have so far.
 Name: Bob Noel

I bought the Copper Chef pan and love it. It is everything it claims to be. But I am single senior and wanted a smaller which I could not find until I ran across a Red Chef skillet. 
Red Chef is a copy cat but without the quality. Food sticks in it and it is hard to clean. I'm afraid the scrub at it hard enough to get it clean for fear that the finish will come off. 
Copper Chef you need to become more competitive. This fraud Red Chef is deluging the stores like Bed Bath and Beyond with everything from skillets to muffin pans.

I found that when I wash this with a moist towel it air dries extremely fast,  this feature by itself makes this set wonderful.  Not to mention it made me a professional chef overnight.  I give it 10 out of 10 stars.

PURCHASED THE COPPER CHEF XL THAT CAME WITH ITS OWN ELECTRIC COOK TOP AND ALL THE EXTRAS WITH IT .....I HAVE HAD IT FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS NOW AND LOVE IT TO DEATH ..IT IS ALL THAT I COOK IN NOW ..IT DOES NOT STICK AND CLEANS UP AS EASY AS THEY SAY... IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BURN FOOD IN AND LARGE ENOUGH TO COOK FOR A LARGE GROUP YET IT TAKES VERY LITTLE OIL TO COOK WITH ...I AM ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO CARRYING IT CAMPING YET ...WAS MONEY WILL SPENT ....LOVE IT ......

Limited Lifetime Warranty Details:

		    
		    
		    The manufacturer warrants that your Copper Chef™ is free of defects in materials and workmanship. The Copper Chef™ non-stick ceramic coating is warranted not to peel, chip, or blister with normal home use for the lifetime of the original purchaser, and all other parts and components are warranted for 60 days from the date of the purchaser’s receipt of the product. This warranty is valid only in accordance with the conditions set forth below:

		    
		    
		    1. Except for the ceramic coating, normal wear and tear are not covered by this warranty. This warranty applies to consumer use only, and is void when the product is used in a commercial or institutional setting.
		    
		    
		    
		    2. The warranty extends only to the original consumer purchaser and is not transferable. In addition, proof of purchase must be demonstrated. This warranty is void if the product has been subject to accident, misuse, abuse, improper maintenance or repair, or unauthorized modification.
		    
		    
		    
		    3. This limited warranty is the only written or express warranty given by the manufacturer. Any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose on this product is limited in duration to the duration of this warranty. Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
		    
		    
		    
		    4. Repair or replacement of the product (or, if repair or replacement is not feasible, a refund of the purchase price less any shipping, handling or processing fees that you paid) is the exclusive remedy of the consumer under this warranty. Under this warranty or in any claim for breach of this warranty, the manufacturer shall not be liable for any incidental or consequential damages for breach of this warranty or any implied warranty on this product. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
		    
		    
		    
		    5. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.
		    
		    

Procedure for Exercise of Limited Lifetime Warranty Rights(In use after expiration of 60 day Money Back Guarantee):

		  	
		  	
		  	If warranty service is necessary, the original purchaser must pack the affected product securely and send it postage paid with a description of the problem and date of receipt, proof of purchase, the purchaser’s name and mailing address, and a check or money order for $14.99 per pan to the following address: Tristar Products Inc., 500 Returns Road, Wallingford, CT 06495.
