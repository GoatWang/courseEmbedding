Honeywell's Resins Spinoff Isn't Enough to Move the Needle









Lou Whiteman




May 12, 2016 10:08 AM EDT













 




























































 Rebuffed in its efforts to do a mega-deal with United Technologies (UTX) , Honeywell International (HON) on Thursday moved on to plan B, announcing plans to spin its $1.3 billion-sales resins and chemicals business into an independent standalone. The company's share price has outperformed the S&P year to date, but has been listless of late and its next catalyst is unclear. The price was unchanged in pre-market trading this morning, and opened up 60 cents, or 0.53%.  Morris Plains, N.J.-based Honeywell said that shares of the unit, to be called AdvanSix, will be spun off to existing Honeywell holders in early 2017. The new company is a maker of compounds including Nylon 6, a polymer resin used in the production of plastics, fibers and films that go into automotive and electrical components and packaging. The business is also a maker of fertilizers and chemical intermediates. Post-spin AdvanSix will be run by Erin Kane, currently vice president and general manager of the Honeywell resins and chemicals business. She has been with Honeywell since 2002, holding numerous marketing, management and business director roles during her tenure. Honeywell, a maker of a range of aerospace, building controls, security and engineered products, has been itching to do a big deal for some time now. The company had engaged in on and off private talks with UTX prior to going public in February with a $90 billion offer, but that bid was rejected by United Technologies as undervalued and Honeywell backed off after markets seemed to agree with UTX's assertion that a transaction would have difficulty clearing antitrust scrutiny.
