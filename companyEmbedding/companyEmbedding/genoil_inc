Genoil Inc.

 

English | Español

 

Genoil is working with one of the largest global policy banks to create a new global consortium of people and companies to develop ten million barrels per day of oil production which will be profitable at today’s low oil prices. Founded in 1996, Genoil was a wholly owned subsidiary of Beau Canada, when Beau was acquired by Murphy Oil Corporation (MUR), Genoil was spun out as a separate company. We recently signed a $50 billion LOI to develop 3.5 million barrels per day of new oil production in Russia and Chechnya and to construct refineries and other energy infrastructure. This LOI was countersigned by Andrey Gusak (Андрей Гусак), the President of the Board of Directors of Grozneft, who was employed by Pavel Borodin in the administrative department of the Russian Federation. Pavel headed the Department of Presidential Affairs of The Russian Federation and ultimately hired Vladimir Putin.
We also recently furnished a Middle Eastern client with a $5 billion LOI from a leading policy bank who is much larger than The World Bank Group to fund the development of 3.5 million barrels per day of new oil production in that region. Genoil is spearheading this strategy and gained industry wide attention for securing these two significant LOI’s in the span of seven months. Genoil will implement our advanced hydroconversion fixed bed technology in both projects. Through strategic Chinese backing from partners like Beijing Petrochemical who have many years of operational experience, Genoil is also able to provide a full range of oil field services to clients from exploration through production, hydrocarbon recovery, and environmental services. By providing structured comprehensive complete solutions including the capability to arrange long term off-take agreements, Genoil can provide clients with more competitive business models than any other company, especially because of Genoil’s much lower overhead, and the importance of relationships and financing in today’s extremely challenging market environment. There are 900 billion barrels of sour, medium, and heavy or high carbon content oil reserves which pose dangerous environmental hazards due to their high levels of impurities. Upgrading and removing the impurities from crude oil streams is the world`s greatest environmental challenge and potential market opportunity estimated at over $45 trillion.

GHU Hydroconversion Upgrader (GHU), is a proven patented process that greatly enhances the performance of a fixed bed reactor, increasing the rates of hydrodesulfurization (HDS up to 95%), hydrodemetalization (HDM 98%), hydrodegnitrogenation (HDN 53%) and overall performance and lowering costs by up to 75% over standard fixed bed hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes. These results were proved during long pilot plant test runs for Conoco Canada Ltd, with their engineers present at Conoco’s bitumen oil fields in Kerrobert, Saskatchewan. Pilot tests proving the same results were also conducted at our 147 acre test site in Two Hills, Alberta for Lukoil and other noteworthy clients.   With a dramatically improved OPEX, customers can capture enormous profits giving them a huge advantage in the marketplace. The GHU can convert the 524 plus fraction by over 80% at the mild conditions of 745 F and 1600 psig and can reduce the acid number from 3.05 to .11.
Low Sulfur Fuel Oil – 0.1% and 0.5 % IMO LSFO : Utilizing the GHU technology around the world, Genoil can produce for the entire shipping industry consistent high quality ISO 8217:2010 compliant 0.1% & 0.5% LSFO (Fuel Oil) at a much lower cost, giving customers a huge competitive edge in the marketplace. Our goal is to meet worldwide demand and provide shipping companies with one standard product globally, that they are already familiar with. Our process is, environmentally friendly and implores latest fixed bed reactor technology. Since 1897, a variety of different hydro-processing technologies have been developed to enable refiners to meet the continuous tightening sulfur specifications imposed upon the industry. Genoil HDS achieves the best results in the world at greatly reduced costs.

About Us

Oil Reserve & Demand Analysis
 
Overview
Crude petroleum is the largest single source of energy in the world, accounting for approximately 35–40% of energy consumed in the world, and is the basic building block for a large number of chemical products consumed globally. In early 2010, global crude petroleum demand was slowly recovering after the first decline in growth since the early 1980’s. Demand growth in the US, Japan, and Western Europe will be slow as domestic economies start to improve. In regions such as South and Central America, Africa, Middle East, and Eastern Europe where domestic demand is slowly on the rise, growth will be more robust as markets give way to exports.  Asia continues to experience the greatest demand growth and a focus on domestic development. World oil demand is forecast to increase steadily 1-2% through 2011 and rise to 2% for 2012-2014.
“The easy oil is coming to an end,” says Alex Munton, a Middle East analyst for the Scottish energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
As of January 1, 2010, the estimated world proved reserves of crude petroleum were 1.2 billion barrels. OPEC currently accounts for 71% of total world oil reserves. Saudi Arabia holds the single largest share of the world’s petroleum reserves at 19% of the total. On a regional basis, the Middle East accounts for nearly 56% of the world’s reserves. North America is second with 15%, and Central and South America is third with 9%, following recent reserves identified in Brazil and Venezuela.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 70% of the world’s remaining oil reserves consist of heavy, high sulfur “sour” crude.  Oil companies must either seek new sources of lighter, easier to extract and refine, crude oil or find new methodologies to utilize the world’s existing heavy oil reserves.  Since the cost for exploration, production and processing continues to climb, the focus should be on the maximum utilization of known reserves by recovering more of the original oil-in-place (“OOIP”) and producing more usable consumer products during refining. The average sulfur content of U.S. Crude oil imports increased from 0.9% in 1985 to 1.4% in 2005, and the slate of imports is expected to continue to sour in coming years. Crude oils are also becoming heavier and more corrosive than they were in the past, largely because fields with higher quality varieties were the first to be developed, and refiners’ preference for quality crude oil has led to the depletion of those reserves over the past 100 years reducing the market share of light, sweet crude that remains.
Published reports indicated that at year-end 2007 there were 650 major refineries located around the world.  These refineries process a total of 85 million barrels of oil per day.  As the sources of premium light-sweet crude oil are depleted, OPEC and other global oil producers will be forced to use increasing amounts of existing heavy-sour crude oil to supply world demand.  Not only will additional refining capacity be required to process the increase supply of crude oil, but refineries will need to be designed to process heavier, lower quality crude oil in order to yield the same amount of transportation fuel. For example, premium crude oils yield almost 70% of their volume as light, high-value products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene), whereas heavier crude oils yield only about 50% of their volume as light products. So in order to produce the same amount of refined product from heavy, sour feedstock, a refinery has to have 1.4 times as much capacity (70 divided by 50). There would need to be 182 refineries built (52 more) in order to supply the world with the equivalent amount of transportation fuel in 2017.
As of January 1, 2010, the US had a reserve to production ratio of approximately ten years, while Russia had a reserve production ratio of seventeen years. Opec nations have a reserve ratio of 92 years while oil producing nations in the Middle East has an average of over 100 years. 
 
GHU® TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT HISTORY 
Starting in May 1998, Genoil (formerly CE3 Technologies Inc.: Canadian Environmental Equipment and Engineering Technologies Inc.) researched innovative processes for the upgrading of heavy crude oils. Because heavy oil reserves account for the majority of total world oil reserves (including non-conventional oils), Genoil had realized that highly efficient processes were required to economically upgrade these heavy oils to lighter products. 
To deliver the heavy oil to the market, heavy oil producers blend it with lighter oils, called condensates or diluents. This requires the implementation of an extensive infrastructure to produce the light oils and to deliver them to the heavy oil field locations. Further, this concentrated demand for light oils for blending could results in shortages and high prices. 
Our concept is to upgrade on-site heavy oils to lighter oils meeting pipeline specifications, eliminating the need for blending, increasing the value of the heavy oils, and having a process with economically viable capital and operating costs even for a small-scale field unit of 10,000 bpd. Of equal or greater importance was the development of a hydroconversion upgrader technology for refineries for raising the API gravity of crude oils to refinery specifications and for recovering the refinery’s heavy residuals. Reduction of sulphur, nitrogen and metals was also a similarly critical goal. 
Global consumption of fossil fuels is increasing every year and the demand for crude oil is expected to exceed 115 million barrels per day within the next fourteen years.  Meanwhile, no new refineries have been built in the United States since 1976 but the race to add refining capacity around the world has already started.  Although existing refineries can process most types of crude oil produced today, the yield of transportation fuel is reduced and waste byproducts increased due to the high sulfur and metal composition of the feedstock.  For example, it takes nearly three barrels of heavy crude oil to produce the same amount of transportation fuel that is refined from one barrel of light sweet crude.  By 2025, the amount of heavy oil produced could be as high as 60% of the total supply based on current trends in new oil discoveries (i.e., limited replacement of depleted oil reserves) and the OPEC basket “blend” of crude oils. 
According to USGS statistics, the supply of heavy crude oil to be produced from conventional reservoirs in the North America alone is estimated to be 35 billion barrels using a conservative recovery factor of only 13%.  Based on OOIP calculations, an additional 135 billion barrels of oil could be produced from existing US fields using enhanced oil recovery methods.  Comparable estimates are available for proven oil basins in South America and the Middle East.  The Upstream Optimization Process including advanced waterflood solutions offers oil producers an efficient, cost-effective approach to enhanced oil recovery.

The system was devised primarily for the bilge water treatment technology developed by Genoil recently. Its aim is to treat slop oil and sludge recovered from bilge water or collected directly from ships. However, the system has numerous other applications, where treatment of slop oil/sludge is to be attained in the most efficient fashion.
Refineries around the world produce nearly ten million barrels of unusable oil each year. Add to that the annual worldwide well production of “Tank Bottoms/Sludge” which is a by product of the oil fields. Tank bottoms may also accumulate in tanks used for storage of fuels such as gasoline, fuel oil or diesel and jet fuel. There is no tank in the world without bottoms. This environmental problems associated present a severe costly disposal and treatment problem. Traditional methods use costly chemicals to treat this problem. Most oil goes untreated and is disposed of in waste pits scattered around the world. Some of these waste pits are extremely large and can exceed 250,000 barrels. Waste pits are known to contaminate local groundwater and cause unwanted health problems if found to contain Arsenic, Barium, Cadium, Chromium, Lead, Selenium and Benzene. All attempts to treat these tank bottoms use either chemical or thermal treatments resulting in a more unwanted water solid mixture left behind. This “Dead Oil” presents an even more difficult challenge. Genoil’s environmental rehab actually pays for itself.






Genoil has the most profitable and sophisticated s...
                    


Genoil has the most profitable and sophisticated self supporting slop oil treatment process in the world. Treating slop oil solves dangerous pollution and storage problems. All slop oils can be upgraded and mixed with crude oil to be processed in the refinery. Currently slop is an enormous burden to oil companies local communities and governments. Genoil’s R & D team has come up with a proprietary process which utilizes many new technologies working in conjunction with the Crystal Separator. Our process ensures efficient slop oil treatment and can upgrade many different types slop oil from oil fields, tanks, ponds, refineries and industry into valuable, marketable product. Genoil guarantees an immediate payback. Slop oils have tremendous variation in composition both chemical and physically. A common thread is that they contain both water and solid impurities, large and small. Often the oil and water form a very tight emulsion. Our process produces drinkable water and clean oil.
The first requirement of a profitable slop oil recovery system is the speed and efficiently that it can separate the three phases. The second is that it is works well enough to sever the closely bound emulsion and separate the smallest particles. The main characteristic trait of slop oil is that oil and water form an emulsion stabilized by ultrafine solids, extremely difficult to separate. Slop-oil or waste oil must go through purification in order to be used as fuel in waste oil fired boilers or incinerators, or be sold to refineries. Purification is carried out in several steps involving the removal of solids and water.
With reference to the block diagram, contaminated hydrocarbons of low value undergo treatment in truly innovative ways for obtaining a valuable product that can be sold as fuel or converted into naphta, lube oil and fuel oil in refineries.
 

The system features a preliminary step capable of separating oil, water and solids from slop oil or emulsified sludge. For example, sludge having the following content:






Preliminary three-phase separation is followed by ...
                    


Preliminary three-phase separation is followed by further treatment of the resulting phases in order to enhance product quality, purify the water and safely dispose of solid impurities. 
Thus, filtration occurs in two stages devised to reduce solids to 25 and 10 microns, respectively with specially designed filters. Periodic filter media replacement is eliminated with obvious advantages in terms of costs, downtime and maintenance. 
When superior oil dryness is required, the system also includes an optional stage that dehydrates hydrocarbons to 500 mg/l water content. Furthermore, this stage is capable of reducing the particle count to ISO 14/12/9 cleanliness levels without utilizing any filters.
Water exiting the first stage contains about 2% oil, which is then completely removed in two separation steps. They employ Genoil’s Crystal and Crystalline units, respectively, technologies developed by Genoil after sustained efforts and research. As recent certifications attest, Crystal oily-water separator is capable of exceeding US Coast Coast/IMO MEPC 107 (49) requirements without filters, a unique feature of this technology. In order to reduce the oil content to 0 mg/l in the most exacting conditions the system comprises a polishing unit that also operates without filters. This arrangement is the only one capable of such outstanding performance in oil-water separation worldwide. 
After complete oil elimination, water is processed in another stage for removing heavy metals, typically contained by sludge. An additional benefit of this step is the destruction of pathogens. As a result, the effluent exiting the water treatment plant is remarkably clean and can be disposed of without restrictions. 
Solid residues resulted from three-stage separation are dehydrated and rendered chemically inert for cost-effective disposal.
Unique energy-saving solutions have been devised throughout the process in order to obtain the final product at the lowest price possible. 
As a result of this combination of innovative solutions, performance and cost effectiveness, Genoil’s technology is unparalleled. 

For ease of transportation and installation a standard plant of up to 7 m3/h capacity is accommodated in an acclimatized container. The system can be custom built to meet specific customer requirements. Further information can be made available upon request.

Oil Reserve & Demand Analysis
 
Overview
Crude petroleum is the largest single source of energy in the world, accounting for approximately 35–40% of energy consumed in the world, and is the basic building block for a large number of chemical products consumed globally. In early 2010, global crude petroleum demand was slowly recovering after the first decline in growth since the early 1980’s. Demand growth in the US, Japan, and Western Europe will be slow as domestic economies start to improve. In regions such as South and Central America, Africa, Middle East, and Eastern Europe where domestic demand is slowly on the rise, growth will be more robust as markets give way to exports.  Asia continues to experience the greatest demand growth and a focus on domestic development. World oil demand is forecast to increase steadily 1-2% through 2011 and rise to 2% for 2012-2014.
“The easy oil is coming to an end,” says Alex Munton, a Middle East analyst for the Scottish energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
As of January 1, 2010, the estimated world proved reserves of crude petroleum were 1.2 billion barrels. OPEC currently accounts for 71% of total world oil reserves. Saudi Arabia holds the single largest share of the world’s petroleum reserves at 19% of the total. On a regional basis, the Middle East accounts for nearly 56% of the world’s reserves. North America is second with 15%, and Central and South America is third with 9%, following recent reserves identified in Brazil and Venezuela.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 70% of the world’s remaining oil reserves consist of heavy, high sulfur “sour” crude.  Oil companies must either seek new sources of lighter, easier to extract and refine, crude oil or find new methodologies to utilize the world’s existing heavy oil reserves.  Since the cost for exploration, production and processing continues to climb, the focus should be on the maximum utilization of known reserves by recovering more of the original oil-in-place (“OOIP”) and producing more usable consumer products during refining. The average sulfur content of U.S. Crude oil imports increased from 0.9% in 1985 to 1.4% in 2005, and the slate of imports is expected to continue to sour in coming years. Crude oils are also becoming heavier and more corrosive than they were in the past, largely because fields with higher quality varieties were the first to be developed, and refiners’ preference for quality crude oil has led to the depletion of those reserves over the past 100 years reducing the market share of light, sweet crude that remains.
Published reports indicated that at year-end 2007 there were 650 major refineries located around the world.  These refineries process a total of 85 million barrels of oil per day.  As the sources of premium light-sweet crude oil are depleted, OPEC and other global oil producers will be forced to use increasing amounts of existing heavy-sour crude oil to supply world demand.  Not only will additional refining capacity be required to process the increase supply of crude oil, but refineries will need to be designed to process heavier, lower quality crude oil in order to yield the same amount of transportation fuel. For example, premium crude oils yield almost 70% of their volume as light, high-value products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene), whereas heavier crude oils yield only about 50% of their volume as light products. So in order to produce the same amount of refined product from heavy, sour feedstock, a refinery has to have 1.4 times as much capacity (70 divided by 50). There would need to be 182 refineries built (52 more) in order to supply the world with the equivalent amount of transportation fuel in 2017.
As of January 1, 2010, the US had a reserve to production ratio of approximately ten years, while Russia had a reserve production ratio of seventeen years. Opec nations have a reserve ratio of 92 years while oil producing nations in the Middle East has an average of over 100 years. 
 
GHU® TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT HISTORY 
Starting in May 1998, Genoil (formerly CE3 Technologies Inc.: Canadian Environmental Equipment and Engineering Technologies Inc.) researched innovative processes for the upgrading of heavy crude oils. Because heavy oil reserves account for the majority of total world oil reserves (including non-conventional oils), Genoil had realized that highly efficient processes were required to economically upgrade these heavy oils to lighter products. 
To deliver the heavy oil to the market, heavy oil producers blend it with lighter oils, called condensates or diluents. This requires the implementation of an extensive infrastructure to produce the light oils and to deliver them to the heavy oil field locations. Further, this concentrated demand for light oils for blending could results in shortages and high prices. 
Our concept is to upgrade on-site heavy oils to lighter oils meeting pipeline specifications, eliminating the need for blending, increasing the value of the heavy oils, and having a process with economically viable capital and operating costs even for a small-scale field unit of 10,000 bpd. Of equal or greater importance was the development of a hydroconversion upgrader technology for refineries for raising the API gravity of crude oils to refinery specifications and for recovering the refinery’s heavy residuals. Reduction of sulphur, nitrogen and metals was also a similarly critical goal. 
Global consumption of fossil fuels is increasing every year and the demand for crude oil is expected to exceed 115 million barrels per day within the next fourteen years.  Meanwhile, no new refineries have been built in the United States since 1976 but the race to add refining capacity around the world has already started.  Although existing refineries can process most types of crude oil produced today, the yield of transportation fuel is reduced and waste byproducts increased due to the high sulfur and metal composition of the feedstock.  For example, it takes nearly three barrels of heavy crude oil to produce the same amount of transportation fuel that is refined from one barrel of light sweet crude.  By 2025, the amount of heavy oil produced could be as high as 60% of the total supply based on current trends in new oil discoveries (i.e., limited replacement of depleted oil reserves) and the OPEC basket “blend” of crude oils. 
According to USGS statistics, the supply of heavy crude oil to be produced from conventional reservoirs in the North America alone is estimated to be 35 billion barrels using a conservative recovery factor of only 13%.  Based on OOIP calculations, an additional 135 billion barrels of oil could be produced from existing US fields using enhanced oil recovery methods.  Comparable estimates are available for proven oil basins in South America and the Middle East.  The Upstream Optimization Process including advanced waterflood solutions offers oil producers an efficient, cost-effective approach to enhanced oil recovery.
