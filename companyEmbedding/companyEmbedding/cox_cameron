Meet Cameron Cox
            















                CAMERON COX has been an avid birder for nineteen years. Now a product specialist for Leica Sport Optics, he spent his late teens and twenties traveling as a "bird bum" to all corners of North America, from southern Mexico to the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. Birds led him repeatedly to Cape May, New Jersey, and it was while counting hawks and waterbirds at Cape May that he realized that identifying distant waterbirds on the wing was fun and challenging, leading to the inspriation for this book.
