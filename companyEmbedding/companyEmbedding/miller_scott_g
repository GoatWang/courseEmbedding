About the Author


G. Tyler Miller has written 62 textbooks for introductory courses in environmental science, basic ecology, energy, and environmental chemistry. Since 1975, Miller's books have been the most widely used textbooks for environmental science in the United States and throughout the world. They have been used by almost three million students and have been translated into eight languages.  Miller has a professional background in chemistry, physics, and ecology. He has a PhD from the University of Virginia and has received two honorary doctoral degrees for his contributions to environmental education. He taught college for 20 years, developed one of the nation's first environmental studies programs, and developed an innovative interdisciplinary undergraduate science program before deciding to write environmental science textbooks full time in 1975. Currently, he is the president of Earth Education and Research, which is devoted to improving environmental education.Scott Spoolman is a writer with more than 30 years of experience in educational publishing. He has worked with Tyler Miller since 2003 as a coauthor on editions of LIVING IN THE ENVIRONMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE, and SUSTAINING THE EARTH. With Norman Myers, he also coauthored ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS: A MODULAR APPROACH. Spoolman holds a master's degree in science journalism from the University of Minnesota. He has authored numerous books and articles in the fields of environmental science, geology and natural history, politics, and business. He worked as an acquisitions editor on a series of college forestry textbooks. He has also worked as a consulting editor in the development of over 70 college and high school textbooks in fields of the natural and social sciences. In his free time, he enjoys exploring the forests and waters of his native Wisconsin along with his family-- his wife, environmental educator Gail Martinelli, and his son Will and daughter Katie.

Miller R/C Products also has many miscellaneous inserts and products that have been developed through the years. 
If what you need is not available from Miller R/C Products, chances are we can custom-make it for you. See your favorite hobby dealer or contact Hap and Nancy Miller direct.
