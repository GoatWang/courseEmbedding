RXi Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a US biotechnology company focused on the field of siRNA. The company is using its siRNA platform to develop a pipeline of dermatology and ophthalmology therapeutics. The company has developed self-delivering RNAi compounds for the treatment of dermal and retinal scarring and is also working on a proprietary topical formulation of diphenylcyclopropenone for the treatment of warts, alopecia areata and cutaneous metastases of melanoma.
Background[edit]
RXi Pharmaceuticals in its first incarnation was founded in late 2006 by the Los Angeles-based drug development company CytRx and four scientific founders including Craig Mello, who had recently received the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his co-discovery of RNAi.[1] The company was taken public in March 2008 when RXi Pharmaceuticals was spun out of CytRx as a separate company.[2] In 2011 RXi Pharmaceuticals acquired Apthera, developer of a peptide vaccine called NeuVax, and changed its name to Galena Biopharma to reflect its change of focus. Galena Biopharma made the decision to spin out the siRNA programs into a separate company, again to be called RXi Pharmaceuticals.[3] This second incarnation of RXi Pharmaceuticals was completed in 2012 when its stock started trading publicly.
RXi Pharmaceuticals stock is traded on Nasdaq under the code RXII. The stock initially traded OTC on 10 May 2012 after the spin-out from Galena Biopharma. It upgraded to OTCQX on 19 June 2013[4] and to Nasdaq on 11 February 2014.[5] The firm is headquartered in Marlborough, Ma. in Middlesex County. The firm's Chairman is Robert Bitterman, previously an executive at Aventis. Its CEO is Dr Geert Cauwenbergh, previously a Johnson & Johnson executive who was named CEO in May 2012.[6] Craig Mello remains involved with RXi as Chairman of its Scientific Advisory Board.
Products[edit]
RXi's technology platform allows the development of 'self-delivering’ RNAi compounds, or 'sd-rxRNA' for short, in which drug-like properties were built into the RNAi compound itself, rather than relying on liposomal delivery to improve circulation time and cellular uptake. This platform was developed through systematic medicinal chemistry screening. RXi scientists have shown the utility of their platform in three papers:[7] [8] [9]
RXi's SD-rxRNA compounds are constructed using a single-stranded phosphorothioate region, a short duplex region, and a variety of nuclease-stabilizing and lipophilic chemical modifications. The result is spontaneous uptake in multiple cell types in vitro and in vivo.
Samcyprone is RXi's proprietary topical formulation of diphenylcyclopropenone. The product, an immunomodulator that works by initiating a T-cell response, entered Phase II for the treatment of cutaneous warts in December 2015.[10] In March 2015 it was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of malignant melanoma stage IIb to IV.[11]
RXi's first sd-rxRNA candidate, RXI‑109, is designed to reduce the expression of connective tissue growth factor, a critical regulator of biological pathways involved in fibrosis, including scar formation in the skin. The product has been in several clinical studies, including: Abdominoplasty Phase I study, .,[12] initiated in June 2012,[13] looked at the ability of RXI 109 to reduce scarring in women undergoing elective abdominoplasty; and Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration Phase 1/2 study.[14] initiated in November 2015.

					Full Description



RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation, incorporated on October 8, 2011, is a clinical-stage ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference (RNAi) company developing therapeutics in dermatology and ophthalmology that address unmet medical needs. The Company's development programs are based on its self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA) platform and Samcyprone, a topical immunomodulator. Its clinical development programs include RXI-109, an sd-rxRNA, for the treatment of dermal and ocular scarring, and Samcyprone for the treatment of such disorders as warts, alopecia areata, non-malignant skin tumors and cutaneous metastases of melanoma. In addition to these clinical programs, it has a pipeline of discovery and preclinical product candidates in its therapeutic areas, as well as in other areas of interest. Its pipeline is focused on approximately three areas, including dermatology, ophthalmology and cosmetic product development. Its RNAi therapies are designed to silence, or down-regulate, the expression of a specific gene that may be over-expressed in a disease condition and its immunotherapy agent treats diseases by inducing, enhancing or suppressing an immune response.Dermatology FranchiseThe Company's RNAi clinical product candidate, RXI-109, a sd-rxRNA, is designed to reduce the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a critical regulator of several biological pathways involved in fibrosis, including scar formation in the skin. RXI-109 is being evaluated in connection with the management of hypertrophic scars. RXI-109 is being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials to prevent or reduce dermal scarring following surgery or trauma. The Company has conducted over two Phase I clinical trials evaluating RXI-109 in a surgical setting. Its Samcyprone is a topical formulation of diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), an immunomodulator that works by initiating a T-cell response. The use of Samcyprone allows sensitization using much lower concentrations of DPCP than are used with existing compounded DPCP solutions, avoiding hyper-sensitization to subsequent challenge doses. Samcyprone is being developed for the treatment of skin disorders, such as warts, alopecia areata, non-malignant skin tumors and cutaneous metastases of melanoma. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to the Company for Samcyprone for the treatment of malignant melanoma stage IIb to IV. The Company has initiated its first Phase II clinical trial with Samcyprone, Study 1502, for the treatment of cutaneous warts.In addition to its dermal scarring and wart programs, it continues to advance its preclinical and discovery programs with its sd-rxRNA technology. The Company has selected collagenase (MMP1) and tyrosinase (TYR) as gene targets for its self-delivering platform. MMP1 is a matrix metalloproteinase involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix. Reduction of MMP1 may be beneficial in the treatment of skin aging disorders, arthritis, acne scarring, blistering skin disorders, corneal erosions, endometriosis and possible cancer metastasis. TYR is a key enzyme in the synthesis of melanin. In addition to its cosmetic program, the Company is evaluating similar sd-rxRNA compounds that target MMP1 and TYR for possible therapeutic development.Ophthalmology FranchiseAs in dermal scarring, CTGF is known to play a role in retinal scarring. RXI-109 can also be used to target CTGF in the eye, where it is known to be involved in retinal scarring. Building on the work in its dermal clinical program, the Company has filed a new investigational drug application (IND) for RXI-109 as a therapeutic for the scarring component of retinal diseases in the eye, such as wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It has initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of RXI-109 in reducing the progression of retinal scarring. In advanced neo-vascular or wet-AMD, its first area of study, retinal scarring can result in continued vision loss even if the patient is being treated with an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. RXI-109 has the potential to fill this unmet medical need by reducing this continuing damage to the retina and in doing so help preserve these patients' vision for a longer period of time. In addition to the clinical trial for the use of RXI-109 as a therapeutic for retinal scarring, it is advancing other early-stage ophthalmology programs. The Company is involved in a number of collaborations to develop a topical delivery for disorders of the cornea. The Company also continues its exploratory efforts to identify potential sd-rxRNA lead compounds and targets from the RNAi-related assets acquired from OPKO Health Inc. (OPKO).Cosmetic FranchiseRXi's cosmetic development program is based on its sd-rxRNA technology. RXI-185, an sd-rxRNA compound targeting MMP1, and RXI-231, an sd-rxRNA compound targeting TYR, are being developed as cosmetic ingredients that may improve skin appearance. The Company's next steps include plans to complete functional and safety testing for both compounds, as well as to develop a method for skin penetration that would be compatible with its compounds.The Company competes with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Benitec Limited, Silence Therapeutics plc, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arbutus Biopharma, Arrowhead Research Corporation, Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sylentis, S.A. and Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen A/S.

Research Programs


Building on the pioneering work of RXi's Scientific Advisory Board Chairman and Nobel Laureate Dr. Craig Mello, scientists at RXi have developed a unique self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA) platform that allows for rapid identification of lead compounds for multiple targets in different therapeutic areas.  Once a target gene of interest with a known sequence is identified, scientists at RXi are able to develop, synthesize and screen sd-rxRNAs in vitro and file intellectual property. RXi's sd-rxRNA platform provides a distinct advantage for the rapid identification of potent compounds as well as the inherent specificity and reduced off target effects when compared to small molecule drugs.

Warts







Common Warts
Samcyprone™ is being studied for the treatment of cutaneous warts, benign epidermal tumors caused by human papillomaviruses (HPVs). They are extremely common, being experienced by most people at some time during their lives. Although most warts will spontaneously disappear without treatment, treatment of these lesions is sought to prevent recurrence. There are many different treatment modalities for warts including physical destruction (cryotherapy, surgical removal, carbon dioxide laser), chemical destruction (salicylic acid, glutaraldehyde, podophyllin, cantharidin, bleomycin) and immunomodulation (interferons, retinoids, contact immunotherapy). However, treatment of warts is complicated by low success rates, prolonged duration of therapy, and the potential for recurrence. It is well established that cell-mediated immune response plays a major role in controlling HPV infections. Therefore, treatment techniques such as immunotherapy have been used to activate the immunologic response to HPV.

Retinal Fibrosis


Diseases of the eye are well suited to therapeutic intervention using sd-rxRNA compounds. Local administration to the eye is an accepted method of administration and generally avoids systemic exposure. The use of sd-rxRNAs may change the landscape of ocular oligonucleotide-based therapeutics, enabling rapid discovery and validation of a wide range of novel therapeutic targets and creating the potential for next generation therapeutics for the treatment of serious ocular disorders. RXi’s sd-rxRNA technology is particularly well-suited this therapeutic area, having improved cellular uptake compared to ‘standard’ siRNAs and potent silencing activity. A clinical trial is ongoing to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of RXI-109 to prevent the progression of retinal scarring, a harmful component of numerous retinal diseases.

RXI-109







RXI-109
RXi Pharmaceuticals’ first clinical candidate, RXI-109, is a self-delivering RNAi compound (sd-rxRNA) being developed to reduce dermal scarring following planned surgeries.  RXI-109 is designed to reduce the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a critical regulator of several biological pathways involved in fibrosis, including scar formation in the skin. 
After the successful filing of an IND,  single- and multiple dose, dose escalation Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating RXI-109 in a surgical setting were initiated in 2012 in healthy volunteers (RXI-109-1201 and RXI-109-1202, respectively).  These two trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of RXI-109, and also provided the first evidence of clinical activity in a surgical setting.  
In early November 2013, we initiated our Phase 2 program with RXI-109.  In the first Phase 2 study (RXI-109-1301), subjects with a long hypertrophic scar in the lower abdominal received scar revision surgery and subsequent treatment with RXI-109 over the first month after surgery.  Subjects received RXI-109 or placebo on a blinded basis at the distal ends of their revised scar, leaving a central untreated section of the scar.  Each subjects’ revised scar area provides the opportunity to compare the appearance of the revised areas after treatment with RXI-109 or placebo or when left untreated, allowing for the within-subject comparison of the three revised scar segments.  Enrollment and dosing in this trial is complete.  
In addition, a second Phase 2 trial was initiated in 2014 in which subject’s with two similar keloids were enrolled (RXI-109-1401).  After the two keloids were surgically removed, one keloid was treated with RXI-109 and one was treated with placebo, again allowing for the within subject comparison of the treatments.  Enrollment and dosing in this trial is complete.
Preliminary data from the first Phase 2 hypertrophic scar trial were used to help design a third Phase 2 trial, RXI-109-1402.  Study 1402 is being conducted in subjects in which one long or two shorter hypertrophic scars are surgically revised.  Treatment of the revised areas with RXI-109 is being compared directly to revised areas that are left untreated on the same subject.  Preliminary data from the initial two cohorts of Study 1402 demonstrated that scars were less visible after six doses of RXI-109 over the course of three months.  Based in part on this new information, two more cohorts were added to this trial in November 2015.  Two extended dosing regimens are currently being evaluated to determine if clinical results are improved if dosing is continued further into the extended proliferation phase of wound healing that leads to hypertrophic scarring. 
Lastly, RXI-109 is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 trial for its safety, tolerability and potential activity in the eye.  RXI-109-1501 is a dose escalation trial in which subjects with late stage, wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with the risk of subretinal fibrosis will be treated with RXI-109.  As in dermal scarring, CTGF is known to play a role in retinal scarring.  Reduction of CTGF in the eye by RXI-109 treatment may reduce the formation of retinal fibrosis that often accompanies late stage AMD and contributes to vision loss.  The main goals of this study are to establish safety and tolerability of RXI-109 in the eye, and to gain a preliminary indication of whether RXI-109 interrupts the scarring process common to these late stage AMD subjects.
