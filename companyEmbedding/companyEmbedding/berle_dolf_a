PHOENIX (September 23, 2015) – Make-A-Wish® America welcomes Dolf Berle, President and COO of Dave & Buster’s Inc.; Derrick Hall, President and CEO of the Arizona Diamondbacks; and Joaquin Hidalgo, President and General Manager of Nike North America, to the National Board of Directors. The newest board members – effective as of July 24, 2015 – have decades of combined experience in corporate executive leadership and will bring strategic guidance and valuable insight to the National Board. Their noteworthy skillsets will help Make-A-Wish continue to grant more and better wishes for children with life-threatening medical conditions. 
Dolf Berle has been the President and COO of Dave & Buster’s since February 2011. The company, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is known for innovatively blending restaurant and entertainment to create an unparalleled guest experience. Since 2012, Dave & Buster’s has served as a corporate sponsor of Make-A-Wish, generating more than $1 million in 2015 alone through its in-store fundraising program. Dolf’s prior experience comes from executive roles at ClubCorp, Lucky Strike Entertainment, Inc. and House of Blues, among others. His primary areas of expertise involve brand management, fundraising activation, retail expansion and operational effectiveness. 
Derrick Hall has led the Arizona Diamondbacks organization as its President and CEO for nine years. In that time, the Diamondbacks have set the sports industry standard for community involvement, corporate culture and fan experience; regularly winning awards and attaining national recognition. Prior to joining the National Board, Derrick served as the Chairman for the Make-A-Wish Arizona Board of Directors, guiding the chapter to historic levels of achievement. The National Board will benefit from Derrick’s outstanding track record when it comes to developing talent and garnering community support.
Joaquin Hidalgo has worked in regional, national and international roles at NIKE, Inc. for the past 25 years and currently serves as the President and General Manager of Nike North America. Joaquin oversees all categories and functions for Nike in North America, driving innovation and inspiration for athletes at every level across sales, marketing, direct-to-consumer (retail) and merchandising. His prior titles at Nike include VP of Emerging Markets, VP of Global Marketing, VP of US Brand Marketing, VP & Global Director of Football and more. Joaquin’s remarkable breadth of executive experience at a Fortune 500 company will serve Make-A-Wish well, most notably in the areas of branding and product marketing.  
“Make-A-Wish could not have found a more dignified, impressive group of business leaders to join our National Board,” said David Williams, President and CEO of Make-A-Wish America. “In addition to their incredible professional achievements, Dolf, Derrick and Joaquin have also demonstrated a commendable passion for philanthropy, and we are excited to have them lend their time and talents toward achieving our mission.” 
With the additions of Dolf, Derrick and Joaquin, the Make-A-Wish America National Board reaches 25 members representing the best and brightest in the areas of human resources, finance, fundraising, management, marketing and operations.

Peter A. A. Berle, Lawmaker and Conservationist, Dies at 69

Peter A. A. Berle, who spent decades fighting for open space and clean water as a New York State assemblyman, commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation and president of the National Audubon Society, died on Thursday in Pittsfield, Mass. He was 69.Graham L. Cox, a longtime friend and former colleague at the conservation department and at Audubon, said Mr. Berle died of injuries that he suffered two months ago in an accident on the farm in  Stockbridge, Mass., where Mr. Berle (pronounced Burly) raised Angus cattle. An outbuilding on the property, Sky Farm, collapsed on him as he was working to dismantle it.Mr. Berle’s passion for the outdoors coincided with the rise of the environmental movement in the early 1970s. A lawyer, he founded Berle, Butzel & Kass, one of the first firms in the country devoted to the new field of environmental law. Later, as a member of the State Assembly from a silk-stocking district on the Upper East Side, he played an important role in the passage of some of New York’s earliest environmental laws.When Gov. Hugh L. Carey named him commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation in 1976, Mr. Berle had the chance to ensure that those environmental laws were rigorously carried out. He took a department that had been focused on stocking lakes with trout for fishing and transformed it into a watchdog on behalf of the state’s air and water quality.

He was involved in the first regulatory actions at the Love Canal chemical dump at Niagara Falls, and he took a stand against General Electric for polluting the Hudson River with dangerous chemicals known as PCBs. Continue reading the main story

Mr. Berle took a particular interest in expanding state lands in the Adirondack Park, which encompasses about six million acres. In 1977, he oversaw the state’s purchase of more than 9,000 acres in the park, including 11 of the highest peaks in the Adirondacks.

“He would joke that he didn’t buy mountains in ones and twos, he bought them by the dozen,” Mr. Cox said.But some of the positions that Mr. Berle took as commissioner ran afoul of Mr. Carey. In particular, Mr. Berle advocated a slow, careful approach to the Westway project, an initiative to build a highway on the West Side of Manhattan that Mr. Carey strongly supported. In late 1979, Mr. Carey replaced Mr. Berle with a commissioner he felt would be more likely to grant the environmental approvals that the project needed to move forward. It was eventually canceled.After leaving state government, Mr. Berle returned to his Manhattan law practice. In 1985, he became president of the National Audubon Society. In his 10 years there, he attempted to update the organization’s image.

In 1989, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo named Mr. Berle as chairman of the Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century, a multiyear effort that resulted in several important recommendations for the Adirondack Park. Mr. Berle also became a director of the New York Independent System Operator, which runs the state’s electricity transmission system.Peter Adolf Augustus Berle was born in New York on Dec. 8, 1937. As a boy, he regularly went camping with his father, Adolf A. Berle Jr., a law professor at Columbia University. The elder Mr. Berle became part of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “brain trust” during his first presidential campaign, and later served as assistant secretary of state and as ambassador to Brazil.After graduating from Harvard, Mr. Berle joined the United States Air Force and was trained as a parachutist and intelligence officer. In 1960, while he was still in the service, he married Lila Sloane Wilde, a teacher from Lenox, Mass. He was discharged with the rank of first lieutenant and then attended Harvard Law School.Mr. Berle is survived by his wife; four children, Dolf Berle of Pasadena, Calif., Mary Berle of Stockbridge, Beatrice Berle of Hoosic, N.Y., and Robert Berle of Charleston, S.C.; and 13 grandchildren.
