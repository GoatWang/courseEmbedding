THE SERVICE ENVELOPE

Wealth affords a different vantage point.  With more choices than a person can humanly navigate and a compelling desire to do the right thing, you slam on the brakes.  Proactive Planning comes to a screeching halt, Reactive Planning becomes the norm.ARE YOU AMONG THE MANY THAT BOUGHT A BOOK BASED ON IT'S COVER?From large institutions to small private firms, every facet of the industry claims to offer complete objectivity. Yet if we analyze their business structures, we find disconnects in the story.  There are product manufacturers and product distributors. The distributors greet the consumer face-to-face. They plant their illusionary flag of objectivity. And then the house's product finds its way to the top of the solution list.  We have invested substantial brain power into building an operational infrastructure that supports our belief in a culture of client service. Operating as a business rather than a collection of individuals, we have solid systems and processes for ensuring quality results in operations, service, design and management of your plan and your assets.





We offer the human interaction you would expect from a small private firm alongside the predictability of a large firm.





BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHEROnce we have designed and documented your Values Filter, we work to bring your full team of advisors into alignment. When contemplating an idea or strategy on your behalf, ALL of your advice team are asked to first peer through your Values Filter. We offer top notch solutions in all facets of financial planning, portfolio management, total balance sheet planning , risk management and estate planning, either through our internal team or our external strategic partners.
