 Open Frame 

      Digital Power's Open-Frame products are the   industry's smallest open frame  AC/DC switchersdelivering up to 800 W of   continuous power from one to four  outputs. These power supplies   incorporate active power factor correction and  85–264VAC universal   input, making them ideal for use worldwide. The Open Frame  products are   built in a 3” x 5” or a 4” x 7” 1U configuration, making them the    highest density open frame power supplies available on the market today.
 Optional DC Input models are especially configured for the telecom market.  Built-in “O-Ring” diodes for N+N and N+1
      redundancy configurations are included  in our standard product which provides for redundancy and hot swap
      applications.  Very high efficiency and power density result from the use of advanced component  and circuit
      technologies, such as synchronous rectification, low profile  transformer and SMT components.
  
      These Open Frame series provides design engineers with a power platform with the  flexibility to 
      meet virtually any design requirement. In addition to standard  products, custom power supplies
      that offer almost any voltage and current  combinations are available upon request. Digital
      Power also offers Open Frame  power platform solutions that include any or all of the
      following features:
* Hot-swap/redundant configuration
      * Enclosure
      
      * Fans
      
      * Power supply encapsulation
      
      * I/O connectors
      
      * Back plane
      
      * Wiring assemblies (harnesses and cabling)
      
      * Ruggedized configuration (conformal coating)

 Power Quick Search






Power Quick Search™ Help
  close



Power Quick Search was designed to that you can enter a few parameters and return valid devices that meet the criteria from the following families:
DC/DC Converters (Integrated Switch)
DC/DC Controllers (External Switch)
PWM Power Supply Controllers
Linear Regulators
Inductorless DC/DC Regulators (Charge Charge)
PMIC Solutions
Plug-in Power Modules

Valid Input Format:
Inputs must be numeric data  only. Measurements such as V for volts or A for amps are not required. Leading zeroes are not required. Valid input  values: 2.3, 5, 0.2, -2.
 
Input
Either nominal Vin or Vin min and max are required for  executing a search. Input voltage  required for the design should be entered in volts. Enter voltage requirements in volts and  numeric data only. Alpha characters are  not accepted.
 
Nominal Vin
Nominal input voltage required  for the design without tolerances.Valid examples for Vin  (nom): 5 or 20
 
Min Vin
Minimum input voltage  required for the design.Valid examples for Vin  (min): 1 or 5
 
Max Vin
Maximum input voltage  required for the design.Valid examples for Vin (max): 5 or 20
 
Output 1
Output voltage and current  required for designs with one output.  Enter voltage requirements in volts and numeric data only. Alpha characters are not accepted.
 
Vout
Output voltage required for  the design. An output voltage range is  not accepted.       Valid examples for  Vout: 1 or -2
 
Iout
Maximum output current  required for the design.     Valid examples for Iout: .5 or 2
 
Output 2
Output voltage and current  required for designs with two outputs required.  Enter voltage requirements in volts and numeric data only. Alpha characters are not accepted.
 
Vout2
Second output voltage  required for the design. An output  voltage range is not accepted.        Valid examples for  Vout: 1 or -2
 
Iout2
Second output current  required for the design.      Valid examples for  Iout: .5 or 2
 
Search for devices with more than two outputs
If devices with more than  two outputs are needed, select this option.  Input voltage is still required for this search, but no output data is  needed.
 
Search for isolated solutions
If isolated power products  are needed, select this option. Input  voltage is still required for this search, and output data can be entered.

FREMONT, Calif., May  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital Power Corporation (NYSE MKT:DPW), ("Digital Power" or the "Company"), a developer and manufacturer of power supply solutions for the most demanding applications in the telecom, medical, industrial and military markets, announced that it has signed a distribution agreement with VOX Power Ltd. (VOX), a provider of state-of-the-art AC/DC modular configurable power supplies to global industrial, medical and defense markets. Photos accompanying this announcement are available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b50b73e0-d2e3-4c09-8d75-46665fe47a31 http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3cbab155-0307-40a8-94f5-c9e4d6c1bcfd Under the terms of the agreement, the Digital Power NEVO and VCCM conduction cooled series power supply solutions will incorporate VOX chassis and modules that are designed for information technology, medically approved products and defense applications. The VCCM series devices include small form-factor, high density, modular and configurable power supplies with power densities that exceed 25W/in3. Designed with highest reliability and versatility in mind, both the NEVO and VCCM series devices are suitable for applications that range from the most controlled environments to the harshest conditions. Standard features include fully adjustable output voltage, externally controllable voltage and current, and series or parallel outputs. Each device can accommodate up to four isolated DC output modules and each module uses SMT components to ensure reliability. Devices can be configured as conduction, convection or forced air cooled. This versatility allows units to be seamlessly integrated across a vast range of applications and makes the devices ideal for standardizing power platforms. To support customers who often require fast fulfillment of orders for prototypes, pre-production devices and small quantities, Digital Power will offer quick turn-around times for the final assembly, voltage adjustment, testing, packaging and delivery of these configured miniature power supplies. For evaluation units and small quantities, devices typically can be delivered in one to three days. The lead time for production volumes is typically 12 weeks. For complete NEVO and VCCM series specifications, installation and user documentation, CAD drawings, safety certificates, and EMC and HALT reports, visit http://www.digipwr.com. Commenting on the agreement with VOX, Digital Power Corporation President and CEO Amos Kohn said, “We are committed to bringing to market the most advanced and power dense solutions available. The NEVO and VCCM series devices with VOX chassis and modules provide options for our customers who have a variety of low to medium volume applications that require multiple or single output power solutions. With these devices, customers can configure their solutions from inventory as needed and prepare multiple output solutions up to 600 watts and single output solutions in the Kilowatt range within one day.” About Digital Power CorporationHeadquartered in Fremont, California, Digital Power Corporation designs, manufactures and sells high- grade, customized and off-the-shelf power system solutions.
