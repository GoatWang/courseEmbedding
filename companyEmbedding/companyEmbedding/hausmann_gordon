A significant number of our clients are foreign based, and we regularly act for a number of listed companies in USA, Israel and elsewhere. In some cases we sit on the boards of these companies.

We are and have remained out of choice a relatively small firm with a compliment of 8-10 lawyers at any one time, together with supporting administrative, secretarial and paralegal staff. This enables us to remain flexible, efficient and cost effective.

Move through the slider to read about the services we offer.



Business Law We frequently deal with most aspects of corporate law, and are experienced with mergers and acquisitions, conducting/managing international transactions and working with teams of foreign lawyers,
               as well as carrying out corporate due diligence both in England and abroad. We deal with all aspects of commercial law, from the establishment and administration of companies, whether English, foreign, on-shore or off-shore, drafting of company Articles, shareholders agreements and trading agreements, to dealing with litigation and disputes, debt recovery, and insolvency. 



Civil and Commercial Litigation We have extensive experience in all forms of litigation, from debt recovery, employment disputes, commercial disputes, intellectual property matters, and landlord and tenant disputes to complex and heavy international cross border disputes, whether in the High Court, County Court or Tribunal.
We also deal with all forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution, including domestic or international arbitration and mediation. 



Tax and Trust Law We deal with residents and domicile and non-domicile issues, for foreigners being in, or which have left England. We often deal with trusts, off-shore companies and tax related matters. We deal with the establishment of trusts, which would typically be under the laws of Jersey, or the laws of other former British protectorates, in view of the well-developed laws of trusts in those jurisdictions.  We usually use trustees who are based in Switzerland so that the trust is resident there, but there are many other possibilities.   



International Trade We deal with all aspects of International Trade, Incoterms, Shipping Law, the drafting of Warehousing and Distribution Agreements, and International Trade disputes, arbitrations and litigation.  



Intellectual Property Law We deal with all intellectual property law issues including breach of copyright, passing off, and cases of trade mark and patent infringement, as well as registration of trademarks. 



Charity Law We have established many charities, for some of which we act as trustee, and are often involved in their administration, including advising trustees of their duties, advising on the filing of the required returns, together with dealing with litigious matters, such as enquiries by the Charity Commission. 



Commercial Property and Residential ConveyancingWe handle a wide range of property matters, both commercial and residential. We have acted for many years on all aspects of property work including the handling of property investment portfolios, developments, the sale and acquisition of commercial and residential properties, commercial leases, licences, property disputes, landlord and tenant matters, and leasehold enfranchisement. We have wide experience in all aspects of finance and mortgages of property transactions. 



Employment LawWe work with our clients on a range of employment law matters including drafting contracts of employment and handbooks, advising as to disciplinary and grievance procedures, TUPE transfers, redundancies and terminations, preparing settlement agreements and Tribunal litigation. We act for employers across a broad range of sectors and also advise individuals in respect of various employment law matters.



Immigration LawWe  handle immigration and work permit issues and deal with immigration and nationality law, ranging from applying for work permits,  international transfers of personnel or applying for an individualâs leave to enter the UK for the purpose of starting his/her own business. 



Wills and ProbateWe handle private client matters, drafting wills and planning of estates, dealing with the estates and grants of probate, often where matters are complex or involve multi-jurisdictional elements.

"We provide a personal and professional service tailored specifically for the client's needs, and have a creative, sophisticated and unconventional approach to any challenge we are faced with. We are often referred to as 'trouble shooters'
         and specialise in achieving amicable settlements in complex and delicate cases without the need for court proceedings and litigation, as we are well aware of the costs implications of any litigation, and with our experience strongly believe that 'a bad settlement can sometimes be better than a good litigation'. However, if necessary, we are fighters all the way." GORDON HAUSMANN LL.B.PARTNER

I was not expecting the cost of shipping. I am very unsatisfied that a $230 product is charged an additional $100 in shipping. Due to the cost of shipping, I most likely will not recommend this website to a friend. With other online retailers marketing their larger products with free shipping (such as wayfair.com or overstock.com) it's tough to encourage others to shop from this vendor and then expect to pay a large shipping bill. All in all, great products, poor shipping model.

I have no idea when to expect my products until 24 hours after I have purchased them. If it takes 4-6 weeks vs 2, I may have gone with a different company.  It would be nice to have a timeline/idea, but otherwise a good experience!
