Careers at Raymond James







People and their financial well-being. That’s our business. Even though we work in major financial markets and multiple disciplines from offices across the globe, it all comes down to people. Which is why it starts there, too – with people like you.
 When you bring your skill and experience to Raymond James, you’ll become part of something bigger than a financial planning and investment services firm. You’ll become a part of helping a couple feel more confident about retiring, of helping a family plan for the next generation, of helping entrepreneurs introduce game-changing ideas and of helping communities continue to thrive.

Commitment to New York 
New York Investment, a commitment to excellence and leadership.
Raymond James Tax Credit Funds’ (RJTCF) is committed to being a leader in affordable housing in New York and providing our developer partners and investors with the highest level of expertise and execution. Our team members are valued added partners, experts on New York State and City housing programs, and focus on ease and efficiency of execution.
Demand for high-quality affordable housing far outpaces supply in New York, especially in the areas of supportive housing for populations in need (veterans, formerly homeless, physically and mentally impaired, and others).  Over the past five years, RJTCF has invested over $750 million in properties in the State of New York representing thousands of units of affordable housing.
RJTCF is investing in affordable housing in New York through a variety of proprietary funds with single investors, as well as an RJTCF-managed multi-investor fund focused on metropolitan New York City which is bringing competitive equity to projects in the greater metro New York area. Already a regional leader, RJTCF is committed to further expanding our presence and increasing our investments in the State in the years to come.
Highlights of RJTCF's recent LIHTC properties in New York and activity in the industry 
Upstate New York Projects
New York State is facing an unprecedented crisis in housing across the state. Three communities, Historic Pastures in Albany, Burton Towers in Newburgh and Watkins Glen are seeing the revitalization of their neighborhoods with affordable housing syndicated by Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. View this link from Citi Group to learn more about the projects.
Historic Pastures consisted of the rehabilitation of an existing scattered-site rental property located in Albany, NY. RJTCF invested $13.5 million of LIHTC equity for 246 residential units and 2,150 square feet of street-level retail space.
Burton Towers is located in Newburgh, NY. RJTCF invested $4.7 million of LIHTC equity for the rehabilitation of an existing 126-unit multifamily housing complex for seniors.
Watkins Glen consisted of the adaptive reuse of a middle school in Watkins Glen, NY which was converted into 51 units of housing for seniors.  RJTCF invested $9.6 million of LIHTC equity in this 1930s building which is eligible for the National Registry of Historic Places. 

Draper Hall Apartments 
Draper Hall Apartments is located on First Avenue in Manhattan between 97th Street and 99th Street across the street from the Metropolitan Hospital.  RJTCF invested $39 million in LIHTC equity for the project which consists of the gut rehabilitation and expansion of former dormitory housing for hospital staff.  Once complete, the project will contain 203 units of affordable housing.  The project is being developed by SKA Marin and was financed with tax exempt bonds as well as subsidy from the New York City Housing Development Corporation.
 

El Barrio’s Artspace PS109

El Barrio’s Artspace PS109 consists of the historic rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of New York City’s public school 109 in East Harlem. RJTCF invested $37 million in LIHTC, and federal and state historic tax credits for the project. The school was originally built in the late 1800’s and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The project will create 90 units of affordable live/work space for artists, as well as space for community organizations. 

Morris Court Apartments
 Morris Court Apartments is located in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx. RJTCF invested $21 million of LIHTC equity in this mixed-income, mixed-use project consisting of the new construction of 201 residential units, approximately 30,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space and approximately 37,000 square feet of underground parking. Project financing consisted of tax-exempt bonds, funds from HPD’s Low-Income Affordable Marketplace Program, and other soft financing.
 

Fairport Apartments wins Project of the Year (Upstate Region) 
 Fairport Apartments, which was developed by Fairport Baptist Church and a for-profit developer and consisted of $9 million in LIHTC equity invested by RJTCF, was recognized at the NYSAFAH Awards for Excellence Reception on November 28, 2012. The project was named Upstate Project of the Year for its extensive renovation of a 1970’s Mitchell-Lama housing development consisting of thirteen two-story buildings, containing 140 units for the elderly, and a community center.
 

Orenstein Building
 The Orenstein Building is located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan just south of the Williamsburg Bridge. RJTCF invested $12 million in LIHTC equity for the rehabilitation of this 12-story building containing 128 units for seniors. The project, financed with tax-exempt bonds, is adjacent to the Bialystoker Synagogue and was owned by an affiliate of the Synagogue and the United Jewish Council (UJC) of the East Side. The UJC is a NFP that was formed in 1972 by the Jewish organizations on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Its mission is to deliver quality services to the poor, the homeless, and the hungry in the neighborhood. The UJC collaborated with a local for profit developer to refinance and rehabilitate the building, which provided the UJC with funds to establish a large long term endowment from which to finance their social services program.




East 99th Street
 East 99th Street is located in Manhattan between First Avenue and Second Avenue across the street from the Metropolitan Hospital. RJTCF invested $21 million in LIHTC equity for the construction of this 176-unit project which will offer independent housing to former patients of the Coler-Goldwater Hospital, a long term care facility located on Roosevelt Island that is slated to close in late 2013. The project, which is being developed by SKA Marin, was financed with tax-exempt bonds, funds from HPD’s Division of Special Needs Housing and funds from New York State’s Medicaid Redesign Team (“MRT”). East 99th Street was the first affordable housing project in the City to utilize funds from the MRT which was established by Governor Cuomo in January 2011.
 

Teller Avenue 
 Teller Avenue is located in the Concourse/Mount Eden neighborhood of the Bronx. RJTCF invested $4 million of LIHTC equity in the new construction of this 43-unit project designed for tenants living with severe and persistent mental illness. Tenants are referred from the New York State Office of Mental Health with 33% of the units being reserved for individuals utilizing New York/New York III Supportive Housing and the remaining units being reserved for high service needs clients. The project, financed with tax-exempt bonds and multiple sources of soft financing, is developed by Postgraduate Center for Mental Health, a non-profit organization that is a major provider of community-based mental health services, housing, job training and placement, and case management services in the New York City Region.




Cornerstone Elderly
 Cornerstone Elderly is located in the Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. RJTCF invested $9 million of LIHTC equity in the rehabilitation of this 151-unit property for seniors.
