GAS CYLINDERS



Luxfer Gas Cylinders is the world's largest manufacturer of aluminium and composite high-pressure gas cylinders for gas storage. 
From manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, France, United States, Canada, China and India, Luxfer supplies high-performance products to customers in more than 50 countries.
A legacy of gas-containment innovation
Aluminium gas cylinders were invented in 1941 in France by Luxfer France (then known as Société Métallurgique de Gerzat). Luxfer invented the cold-extruded, seamless aluminium cylinder in the mid-1950s and began manufacturing its first cylinders in the United Kingdom. It began producing aluminium cylinders in the United States in 1972. In 1976, Luxfer added fibre-glass-reinforced, hoopwrapped cylinders to its growing product range, followed by full-wrapped models ten years later. In 1997, the company introduced ultra-lightweight composite cylinders fully wrapped with aerospace-grade carbon fibre. These technological advancements helped make Luxfer the world’s leading supplier of life-support cylinders for firefighters and other emergency personnel. Medical cylinders are another important market, for which Luxfer manufactures a wide range of aluminium and composite models.
Luxfer manufactures products for a wide variety of other applications, including cylinders for industrial and speciality gases; beverage cylinders; and fire extinguisher cylinders.
Over the years, Luxfer Gas Cylinders has introduced many major innovations in gas containment, including its patented higher-strength L7X® aluminium alloy and its advanced composite technologies.
Composite product growth
In recent years, Luxfer innovations in lightweight composite products have changed way that oxygen therapy is provided in Europe. Another major growth product is large carbon composite cylinders for storage of compressed natural gas used in alternative fuel (AF) vehicles, including trucks, buses and automobiles. From its state-of-the-art facility in Riverside, California, Luxfer supplies an expanding range of AF cylinders to customers around the world. Luxfer also operates an exclusive European centre in Italy that supplies both cylinders and complete AF systems.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

About Luxfer Holdings PLC (adapted from Luxfer Holdings PLC prospectus): Luxfer Holdings is a global materials technology company specializing in the design, manufacture and supply of high-performance materials, components and gas cylinders to customers in a broad range of growing end-markets. Their key end-markets are environmental technologies, healthcare technologies, protection and specialty technologies. Customers include both end-users and manufacturers that incorporate Luxfer products into their finished goods. Products include specialty chemicals used as catalysts in automobile engines to remove noxious gases; corrosion, flame and heat-resistant magnesium alloys used in safety-critical, aerospace, automotive and defense applications; photo-sensitive plates used for embossing and gold-foiling in the luxury packaging and greetings card industries; high-pressure aluminum and composite gas cylinders used by patients with breathing difficulties for mobile oxygen therapy, by firefighters in breathing apparatus equipment and by manufacturers of vehicles which run on compressed natural gas; and metal panels that can be "superformed" into complicated shapes to provide additional design freedom for a wide variety of industries, including aerospace, high-end automotive and rail transportation.

Area of expertise covers the chemical and metallurgical properties of aluminum, magnesium, zirconium, rare earths and certain other materials. Luxfer has pioneered the application of these materials in certain high-technology industries. For example, Luxfer was the first to develop and patent a rare-earth containing magnesium alloy (EZ33A) for use in high-temperature aerospace applications such as helicopter gearboxes; they were the first to manufacture a high-pressure gas cylinder out of a single piece of aluminum using cold impact extrusion; and they developed and patented the superforming process and the first superplastic aluminum alloy (AA2004) and were the first to offer superformed aluminum panelwork commercially. 

Luxfer claims, "We believe that we have leading positions, technically and by market share, in key product areas, including magnesium aerospace alloys, photo-engraving plates, zirconium chemicals for automotive catalytic converters and aluminum and composite cylinders for breathing applications."

Some of Luxfer's key new development projects has them working within the Seat Committee of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and several aircraft seat manufacturers to introduce lightweight seats composed of magnesium into civil aircrafts; with the benefit of funding from the U.S. Army Research Labs, developing a magnesium alloy for use as lightweight armor plates on personnel carriers, which funding will also support Luxfer's internal development of commercial production capabilities for the alloy; the Intelligent Oxygen System, or IOS, developed in consultation with BOC Linde to deliver medical oxygen; a bio-absorbable magnesium alloy developed for a biotechnology customer for use in cardiovascular applications; and catalytic material developed jointly with Rhodia to meet the anticipated needs of automotive manufacturers for more effective diesel catalysis to satisfy new environmental regulations as they come into effect in Europe and the United States.


Luxfer, as it is today, began back to the 1982 merger of The British Aluminium Company Limited and Alcan Aluminium U.K. Limited, which created British Alcan. The original Luxfer Group Limited was formed in 1996 in connection with a transaction that resulted in the Management Buy-In of certain downstream assets of British Alcan. All of the share capital of Luxfer Group Limited was later acquired by Luxfer Holdings PLC in 1999, which became the parent holding company of their operating subsidiaries around the world.This description is adapted from Luxfer Holdings prospectus.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
