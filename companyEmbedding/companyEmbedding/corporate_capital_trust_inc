Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  0.00 (03/04/16)      EPS (TTM)  $1.18      Market Cap $29,043     Shares Outstanding N/A     Public Float N/A     Yield CPTC has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

            Risk Factors | Corporate Capital Trust
        



































  



















 


                                            NAV: $9.001   DRP Price: $9.072





                                        Risk Factors
                                    

Risk Factors Relating to the Offering of our Securities


                                        An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and may be considered speculative. You should carefully consider the information found in the Risk Factors within our filings  before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. Risks involved in an investment in us include (among others) the following:
                                    

We are a relatively new company and are subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any business with a relatively short operating history, including the risk that we will not achieve our investment objective and that the value of our common stock could decline substantially.
                                        
You should not expect to be able to sell your shares regardless of how we perform.
                                            
If you are able to sell your shares of common stock, you will likely receive less than your purchase price and the current net asset value per share. Because you will be unable to sell your shares, you will be unable to reduce your exposure on any market downturn.
                                                
We do not intend to list our common stock on any securities exchange during or for what may be a significant time after the offering period, and we do not expect a secondary market in the shares to develop.
                                                
We have implemented a share repurchase program, but only a limited number of shares of common stock are eligible for repurchase by us. In addition, any such repurchases will be at a price less than the current offering price in effect on the date that we initiate each quarterly repurchase offer.
                                                
You should consider that you may not have access to the money you invest for an indefinite period of time. 
                                                
An investment in our shares of common stock is not suitable for you if you need access to the money you invest.
                                                
Our distributions in our initial year of investment operations were not based on our investment performance, but were supported by our Advisor in the form of operating expense support payments. Now we are obligated to repay our Advisors and these repayments will reduce the current and future distributions that you should otherwise receive from your investment.
                                                


Our portfolio companies may request our assistance in the management of their affairs, however we may not have director or shareholder controls over the business affairs of the companies to which we loan capital. In addition, our investments in portfolio companies will be structured to be held until maturity and may not provide us with favorable terms for short term liquidity of the capital that we invest in them.
                                        
 We have not established any limit on the extent to which we may use borrowings or offering proceeds to fund distributions to shareholders, which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to sustain distributions at any particular level. Our distributions may exceed our earnings, particularly during the period before we have substantially invested our net offering proceeds, which may result in commensurate reductions in net asset value per share.
                                        
This is a “best efforts” offering and, if we are unable to raise substantial funds we will be more limited in the number and type of investments we may make. As a result, our ability to diversify will be constrained.
                                        
Our investments may include original issue discount instruments. To the extent original issue discount constitutes a portion of our income, we will be exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of the cash representing such income.
                                        
You should not rely on your own broker-dealer to make an independent review and investigation of the terms of this offering. Because you should not rely on your broker-dealer, you will not have the benefit of any independent review and evaluation of the terms of this offering by our Managing Dealer. In addition, we do not, and do not expect to, have research analysts reviewing our performance or our securities on an ongoing basis. Therefore, you will not have an independent review of our performance and the value of our common stock relative to other publicly traded companies.

                                    Brought to you by private investment management firm CNL and global alternative asset manager KKR, Corporate Capital Trust II intends to provide shareholders with monthly income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation.3 Alternative investments, including non-traded BDCs, may provide diversification in portfolios comprised of traditional assets and may potentially mitigate the impact of rising interest rates.

1 The public offering price is as of July 27, 2017. The public offering price of the common stock of Corporate Capital Trust II is referred to as Class T shares.
                    

2 The distribution rate shown does not represent the total return of Corporate Capital Trust II. Distributions are not guaranteed in frequency or amount. Annualized distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the quarterly distribution amount on March 31, 2017 and dividing by the most recently published public offering price as of the same date. Distributions are declared for weekly record dates and monthly payment dates. Distributions represent the annualized distribution rate as of the date indicated. Since inception, distributions have been supported by the advisors in the form of fee waivers and operating expense support waivers, and are not estimated to be a return of capital or supported by borrowed funds. Distributions exceed earnings and are not based on the investment performance; there can be no assurance that distributions will be sustained at current levels or at all. Near-term distributions will be paid from fee waivers or deferrals, expense support waivers, offering proceeds, borrowings and cash from operations. Corporate Capital Trust II is typically obligated to repay the advisors over several years, reducing future distributions and potentially diluting value for shareholders entering the fund at a later date.

2 The Distribution Reinvestment Price is determined by the Company’s board of directors, or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, and is (i) not less than the net asset value per share determined in good faith by the board of directors or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, immediately prior to the payment of the distribution (the “Net Asset Value (NAV) Per Share”) and (ii) not more than 2.5 percent greater than the NAV Per Share as of such date.
                                

3 Distributions are declared and paid monthly. Distributions represent the annualized distribution rate as of the date indicated. Future distributions may include a return of principal or borrowed funds which may lower overall returns and may not be sustainable. There can be no assurance that distributions will continue at historical or current levels or at all.
