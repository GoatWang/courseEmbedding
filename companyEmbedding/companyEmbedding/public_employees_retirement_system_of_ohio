Ready to Retire
Learn, Plan, Act
If you’re eligible for retirement within the next four years, we understand the announcement of major changes to the OPERS retiree health care program may have prompted you to consider, or even re-evaluate, your retirement plans.
Effective Jan. 1, 2015, eligibility for health care coverage changed. OPERS offers health care coverage to retirees 60 or older with at least 20 years of qualifying service, and to all retirees with 30-32 years of qualifying service depending on their group.


Learn More: Pension and Health Care Eligibility


Effective Jan. 1, 2015, a participant’s monthly premium allowance will be based on their years of service at retirement and their age at enrollment in the OPERS health care plan.
With these changes in mind, OPERS has created this “Learn, Plan, Act” website section to help you identify the most ideal time frame for retirement and make an informed decision regarding your retiree health care coverage. These pages offer detailed information on the steps you need to take as you move toward retirement. They also provide answers to questions we frequently hear from members.
In addition, the Plan page features a link to the OPERS Retirement Planner, an innovative tool created to allow you to estimate both pension and health care costs at different retirement dates. This is the first time we have offered members a tool that blends both pension income and health care costs to provide members a “big picture” view of their retirement options. 


Learn
Knowing all the facts about saving for retirement, your OPERS retirement benefit and retiree health care coverage will allow you to take a more complete approach to maximizing your retirement. This section will provide information that may make a lasting difference in how you spend your retirement years. Explore this section to gain the knowledge necessary to make insightful decisions about your next steps to retirement.

Learn about your retirement and health care options


Plan
As you draw closer to making a decision about retirement, it is critical that you spend time looking at the details. How much income will you need? Where will you obtain health care coverage? This section will help you answer those questions. Explore this section to understand your options and start formulating your ideal retirement  plan.

Plan out your retirement and health care options


Act
It is finally here. It’s time to take action. You have worked for many years and now it’s time to reap the benefits of all your work and planning. Enjoy the moment as you journey through the final stages to retirement. Explore this section to learn the ins and outs of the retirement application process including timing, forms, documents and who to contact for more information.

Ohio Public Employees Retirement System


The Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS) was established to provide a secure retirement for Ohio’s public employees and their families. Even with state-mandated retirement plans, it is important to consider the options in making decisions that are right for you. The Office of Human Resources is pleased to provide this overview, and you are encouraged to learn more at opers.org.
Upon hire, you have two options for selecting a retirement plan:

Enroll in OPERS, or
Elect the Alternative Retirement Plan (ARP), if eligible

If you select the ARP, an election form for the ARP must be received by the Office of Human Resources no later than 120 days from, and including, the effective date of your eligible appointment. If an ARP election form is not received, you will automatically be placed into OPERS.
If you remain in OPERS, you have 180 days from your hire date to select a plan within OPERS.
Both you and the university contribute to your retirement account. Your contributions are made on a pre-tax basis; federal and state taxes are deferred until benefits are paid. Benefits are exempt from local and municipal taxes within Ohio, except school district income tax. Any investment return on your account is also tax-deferred.
OPERS offers three plans:

Traditional Plan – Defined Benefit (DB)
Member Directed- Defined Contribution (DC)
Combined

To view a side-by-side comparison of the three plan choices within OPERS, see Comparison of Retirement Plan Options for Staff.
Employees of Ohio public colleges and universities do not participate in the federal Social Security system, other than contributions to Medicare. If you are eligible for a Social Security benefit from other employment in addition to your OPERS benefit, there may be a reduction in your Social Security benefit. Learn more about the Windfall Provision.
Note: The following is a summary and subject to change at any time. For the most current and detailed information, please visit the OPERS website or call OPERS at (800) 222-7377.


Plan Options





Traditional Pension Plan - Defined Benefit (DB)❯×

The OPERS Traditional Pension Plan is a defined benefit plan.
The benefit is determined by a formula that uses your age, years of service, and eligible final average salary1 at the time of your retirement. You and Ohio State make contributions to this plan to fund retirement benefits. The investment of contributions in this plan type are managed by OPERS; therefore, you do not bear any investment risk. Your benefits grow with your years of service and final average salary.
Vesting
The employee contributions are vested immediately. A portion of the university contributions are vested after 5 and 10 years. In addition, after 1.5 years of service credit, you are vested for survivor benefits. After 5 years of service credit, you may be vested for disability benefits and an age and service retirement benefit.2
How Your Benefit Grows
Your benefit amount grows by adding years of service credit (earned or purchased) and with increases to your eligible compensation.
Access to Funds at Termination or Retirement
You may choose from a number of options:

Receive a retirement pension benefit based on the plan formula
Leave your account on deposit for future benefits
Roll your vested account funds into another qualified plan or IRA
Receive a lump sum refund of your contributions; you also may be eligible for a portion of the employer contributions plus interest

Additional Benefits
When enrolled in the OPERS Traditional Plan, you may be eligible for access to health care coverage and disability and survivor benefits. Specific eligibility criteria must be met.

1 Subject to terms and conditions of the plan and applicable law.
2 Subject to terms and conditions of the plan and applicable law.




Member-Directed Plan - Defined Contribution (DC)❯×

The OPERS Member-Directed Plan is a defined contribution plan. This is a 401(a) account. The member directs how contributions are invested (within certain limitations) and bears sole responsibility for the investment risk. Retirement benefits are based on the amount contributed and also affected by expenses and account gains and losses in the OPERS investment options the member selects, as well as annuity factors, such as retirement age.
A portion of the university’s contribution is credited to a Retiree Medical Account (RMA). You can use the RMA for the payment of qualified health care expenses after separation from service.
When participating in a defined contribution plan, Ohio law requires that a portion of the employer contribution be reduced and applied towards the defined benefit plan’s unfunded liability, known as the mitigating rate. This amount may be adjusted up or down on a periodic basis. For information on the current mitigating rate, visit opers.org.
Vesting
The employee contributions are vested immediately. The university contributions are vested based on years of participation. See the OPERS vesting schedule for the Retiree Medical Account.
How Your Benefit Grows
Your account consists of contributions made by you and the university, as well as with any investment gains or losses you may have on those contributions.
Access to Funds at Termination or Retirement
You may choose from a number of options:

Leave your account on deposit for future benefits
Roll the vested portion of your account into another qualified plan or IRA
Receive a lump sum refund of your contributions; you also may be eligible for a portion of the employer contributions plus interest
Receive fixed-period payments over a set number of years
Receive systematic withdrawals
Receive single or joint life monthly annuity from the vested portion of your account with continuing survivor protection

Additional Benefits
You will have access to your RMA if disabled while employed.




Combined Plan❯×

The OPERS Combined Plan is a combination of the other two OPERS plans – the Traditional Pension Plan (Defined Benefit) and the Member-Directed Plan (Defined Contribution)

Under the defined benefit portion of the Combined Plan, the university’s contributions fund the Traditional Pension Plan portion, and your retirement benefit is determined by a reduced formula (similar to the formula for the Traditional Pension Plan). OPERS investment professionals manage these funds.
The member’s contributions are deposited into the member’s individual account within the plan and invested as directed by the member into one or more of the OPERS investment options. The member’s retirement benefit under this portion of the Combined Plan is based on the amount contributed, expenses and account gains and losses in the OPERS investment options selected, as well as annuity factors, such as age of retirement.

Vesting
The employee contributions are vested immediately. A portion of the university’s contributions are vested after 5 and 10 years. In addition, after 1.5 years of service credit, you are vested for survivor benefits.  After 5 years of service credit, you may be vested for disability benefits and an age and service retirement benefit.
How Your Benefit Grows
The defined contribution account consists of your contributions, as well as with any investment gains or losses you may have on those contributions. The benefit amount from the defined benefit portion grows by adding years of service credit (earned or purchased) and with increases to your eligible compensation.
Access to Funds at Termination/Retirement
For the defined contribution portion, choose from a number of options:

Leave your account on deposit for future benefits.
Roll the vested portion of your account balance into another qualified plan or IRA.
Receive a lump sum refund of your contributions; you also may be eligible for a portion of the employer contributions plus interest.
Receive fixed-period payments from the vested portion of your account balance over a set number of years.
Receive systematic withdrawals.
Receive single or joint life monthly annuity with continuing survivor protection.

For the defined benefit portion, choose from a number of options:

Leave your account on deposit for future benefits.
Roll your vested account funds into another qualified plan or IRA.
Receive a lump sum refund of your contribution; you may be eligible for a portion of the employer contributions plus interest.
Receive a retirement pension benefit based on the plan formula.

Additional Benefits
You may be eligible for access to health care coverage, disability and survivor benefits. (See Benefit information)

Retirement


The Ohio State University supports the efforts of faculty and staff to plan a fulfilling, financially secure retirement. As part of its total rewards package, the university offers an array of retirement options to help you meet your financial goals. Retirement program eligibility is based on your appointment type (faculty, staff or student) and your full-time equivalency (FTE).

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.
