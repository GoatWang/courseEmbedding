Sofinnova

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search


Sofinnova is the name shared by two venture capital firms, Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners. The name Sofinnova is believed to be a contraction of the French, "Société de Financement de l’Innovation" or, Innovation Venture Capital Company. Both firms trace their roots back to Sofinnova SA, an investment institution founded in Paris in 1972. The two firms have raised ~$4B since inception, and shared a similar investment strategy of investing in the life science and technology sectors. The two sister firms distinguish themselves on the basis of their target geographies, and have been fully independent since 1997.

Sofinnova Ventures has offices in Menlo Park, CA and San Diego, CA and focuses largely on US biotech investments, with ~20% allocation for Europe.
Sofinnova Partners is based in Paris and focuses primarily on European biotech and cleantech investments, with a similar reciprocal allocation for the US.

Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners have had historically some of the same Limited Partners, and have co-invested together in selected companies, including: Flamel, Cerep, Genset, Actelion, Preglem, Movetis, Ascendis, Obseva, Auris and Nucana. Both firms work together in a collegial way to exchange information and due diligence in each other's respective geographies. The firms do not have an obligation to show each other deals or to co-invest, but historically have co-invested together in ~10% of their collective investments.

1970s: The Founding of Sofinnova[edit]

1972 - Sofinnova was founded with the backing of several French financial institutions (most notably Crédit National) and was notable at the time for creating the first "American style" venture capital firm in France. Peter Brooke, the founder of TA Associates, was a board member of Sofinnova SA in its early years. Sofinnova SA quickly established a presence in the European market through the formation of Sofinnova Partners in Paris. Sofinnova SA owned this firm from 1972 until 1997.
1974 - Sofinnova became the first European venture company to enter the US market launching its US affiliate, Sofinnova, Inc (Sofinnova Ventures). Sofinnova co-founder, Jean Deleage, who would later co-found US venture firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co., was appointed the head of the US operation. Sofinnova's US business gained attention for its role as an early backer of Tandem Computers and Genentech in the early 1980s.
1976 - Sofinnova co-founder Jean Deleage established the American subsidiary of Sofinnova, called Sofinnova, Inc., in San Francisco, which eventually became Sofinnova Ventures. Deleage departed Sofinnova in 1979 to co-found another venture capital firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co.. In 1981, working with Deleage, Sofinnova developed a partnership with Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co. and ultimately other US firms. Jean-Bernard Schmidt, who would later serve as Chairman of Sofinnova, was named the head of US operations of Sofinnova, Inc.

1980s: The Early Growth of Sofinnova[edit]

1985 - Sofinnova completed an initial public offering with a listing on the Paris Stock Exchange.
1987 - Alain Azan moved to San Francisco to take over management of Sofinnova Ventures, replacing Jean-Bernard Schmidt. Schmidt would be named Chairman of Sofinnova, retaining that position through 2007. Sofinnova Ventures completed fundraising for SVP I, which was an private equity fund originally intended to invest in European companies expanding in the US. Ultimately, Sofinnova Venture Partners would shift its focus toward investments in domestic US companies.
1989 - Sofinnova Partners completed fundraising for Sofinnova Capital, its first private equity fund in France, with €38M of investor commitments. Sofinnova's investments in this fund include Genset Corporation as well as Cerep, Egide and Flamel.

1990s: The Reorganization of Sofinnova into Sofinnova Partners and Sofinnova Ventures[edit]

1993 - Sofinnova delisted itself from the Paris exchange to raise capital privately through traditional private equity funds. Prior to the 1997 reorganization, Sofinnova Ventures raised three venture funds totaling $57M, and Sofinnova Partners raised funds with €85M in commitments.
1997 - The global Sofinnova organization restructured, formally creating two separate management companies, one for Sofinnova Ventures, and one for Sofinnova Partners. The reorganization was done on the basis of geography, creating Sofinnova Ventures in the US and Sofinnova Partners in Europe. Following a management buyout, each of the management companies was solely owned by its respective management teams.

2000s: The Move to Life Science for Sofinnova[edit]

2000 - Sofinnova Ventures hires Jim Healy, MD, PhD and together he and Mike Powell, PhD rebuilt the Sofinnova Ventures LS brand, with focus on clinical stage drug development companies.
2003 - Sofinnova Ventures started its EIR/Executive Partner program in Life Sciences, with its first EIR Barry Selick. Following this, several other EIRs/Executive Partners joined Sofinnova Ventures from then until 2015, including: Jeff Stein, David Kabakoff, Bill Ringo (Strategic Advisor), Goro Takeda, Jay Shepard, George Horner, Lars Ekman and Dan Welch.
2006 - Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners first sponsored the Sofinnova Biopharm Partnering Conference in Japan, headed up by Sofinnova's Goro Takeda. In 2014, the conference teamed up with Biotechnology Industry Organization, making this the largest biopartnering meeting in Japan.
2007 - SVP VII was raised, which was Sofinnova Ventures' first fund that was overwhelmingly focused on Life Science (80%+), with emphasis on drug development. Their next fund, SVP VIII in 2011 was exclusively (100%) Life Science. At the same time, Sofinnova Partners in Paris moved from a balanced IT/LS venture firm, to one that was predominantly focused on Life Science.
2008 - Sofinnova Ventures made its last IT investment (Enovix). The remaining IT team was active for several years after this to monitor and monetize the final IT investments.

2010s: New Growth Initiatives at Sofinnova[edit]

2010 - Sofinnova Partners started their Green Seed Fund and hired Joško Bobanović to manage this new initiative. In 2012, this seed fund initiative was announced in conjunction with the Sofinnova Capital VII announcement.
2013 - Sofinnova Ventures worked with General Partner Garheng Kong to spin out a new fund, called HealthQuest Capital. HQC's mandate is to provide growth capital to companies transforming healthcare, with a focus on companies other than drug development. HQC raised their second fund, at $225M, in 2016, and transitioned to further independence from the parent Sofinnova Ventures organization.
2017 - Sofinnova Partners announced the first closing of Sofinnova Industrial Biotech I, at €106 million. The fund, dedicated to renewable chemistry, follows a series of 9 investments in the sector since 2009. It will leverage an experienced and dedicated team, initially composed of Denis Lucquin, Managing Partner, Joško Bobanović, Partner, Michael Krel, Principal and Guillaume Baxter, Senior Associate.

Founded in 1974, Sofinnova is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical venture capital firm with approximately $2.2B under management. We are a passionate and committed team of MDs and PhDs that deploy human and financial capital to improve the lives of patients through science. Our mission is to provide industry leading venture returns by delivering transformative medicines to patients. We live our mission to deliver outstanding results for those we serve – patients, entrepreneurs, and the people and organizations that entrust us with their capital.
Sofinnova specializes in clinical and late preclinical investments in biopharmaceutical products. We actively partner with entrepreneurs across all stages of company formation including securing initial funding, building successful management teams, forming impactful corporate alliances, and navigating the M&A acquisition or IPOs' process. We seek to build world class companies that aspire to dramatically improve the current state of medical care today and ultimately, the lives of patients.

The History of Sofinnova Ventures
Sofinnova represents decades of active venture investing in Silicon Valley.  Our original French parent firm, Sofinnova SA, was founded in Paris in 1972, and has the distinction of being one of the earliest venture capital firms in Europe. Sofinnova moved into the US in 1974, to build a Trans-Atlantic US-EU connection.  Jean Deleage was the first President and Founder of the US arm of Sofinnova.  Sofinnova SA had great success in the US, being an early investor in stellar companies such as Tandem Computers and Genentech.
 Sofinnova SA initiated a new family of US venture funds in 1984, aptly described as Sofinnova Venture Partners I, II, III and more. Sofinnova invested the first three of these funds in primarily information technology, and was known as a ‘boutique French VC firm’ until the late 90s.  Each of these US Sofinnova funds were raised, invested and managed independently from the funds managed and invested by Sofinnova in Paris, and both partnerships continued to be owned by Sofinnova SA until the late 90s.
 In 1997 Sofinnova restructured into two independent management firms, Sofinnova Partners in Paris, and Sofinnova Ventures in San Francisco. Each firm became an independent venture capital firm with independent funds, investment strategies and partnerships. It was the vision of the partners in 1997 that each of the firms should be owned by the partners doing the investing, allowing the carried interest profits to remain with the investing professionals, aligning their interests with the Limited Partners who invest in the funds.  That said, the sister firms share deal flow, expertise and due diligence information, as well as invest together selectively on a case-by-case basis.
 Since 2007, Sofinnova Ventures has been almost exclusively life science focused, and its two most recent funds, SVP VIII and SVP IX, are exclusively life science.   Their biotech focus is on drug development, mostly later stage, with an emphasis on specialty pharma, orphan drugs and rare diseases.  Key therapeutic areas include: oncology, respiratory, neuro, dermatology, and areas where a primary sales force is not needed. Sofinnova Ventures has a long track record of working closely with entrepreneurs to build leading biotech companies.

Sofinnova Ventures Surpasses Target, Raises $440M Health Fund
October 17, 2011 - Dow Jones VentureWire Lifescience
by Brian Gormley
Sofinnova Ventures has surged past the hard cap set for its eighth fund to gather $440 million for what will be its first partnership devoted entirely to health care.
Sofinnova set out in mid February with a $325 million target for Sofinnova Venture Partners VIII LP and secured more than $250 million in a first closing in late June, said General Partner James I. Healy. Seeing strong interest, the firm asked limited partners for permission to exceed the $400 million hard cap of the fund, which closed on Friday, Healy said.
The firm's success bucks a negative trend in venture capital fund-raising. In a sign that the industry is going through a shakeout, venture-investment totals have outpaced fund-raising tallies since 2008, according to VentureSource, which is owned by Dow Jones & Co., publisher of VentureWire.
With the venture industry failing to deliver good returns in recent years, many institutional investors are losing interest in the asset class. As a result, a number of venture investors have struggled to raise new funds, including some well-established firms. Recently, health-care investor Prospect Venture Partners released limited partners from their commitments to its fourth fund after concluding that it wouldn't be able to raise enough capital to execute its strategy, for example.
Sofinnova, with its good track record and deep well of previous investors, quickly built momentum during its fund-raising. The firm, drawing mostly on return investors, boosted the fund size to broaden its investor base. Even so, it had more demand than it could accommodate, according to Healy. A number of LPs committed more this time than they did to the firm's $375 million seventh fund, he said. Healy declined to discuss the new fund's terms.
Return investors include California State Teachers' Retirement System, Oregon State Treasury, San Francisco Employees' Retirement System and University of Texas Investment Management Co. New backers include Teachers' Retirement System of the State of Illinois. 
Sofinnova's decision to raise a health care-only fund isn't a dramatic shift. It invested about 80% of fund seven in medical companies, Healy said. Over the years, however, it's become increasingly important to have deep expertise in specific industries, which led the partners to conclude that specialized funds work best, he said.
The firm, whose technology portfolio includes Crocus Technology, a developer of magnetic random access memory technology for the semiconductor and electronics-systems industries, expects to raise a tech fund at some point, Healy said.
Sofinnova's health-care strategy calls largely for backing drug companies whose products are already in human studies. The first of the 20 to 22 investments the firm expects to make from the new fund is in SARcode Bioscience Inc., which will use a $44 million round that Sofinnova led in July to run Phase III trials of a dry-eye disease drug, for example. 
The firm, which plans to sink 70% to 75% of the fund into mid- to late-stage health-care products, sees strong opportunity to spin companies with these types of products out of larger players, Healy said. As drug manufacturers reassess their priorities, they're increasingly willing to part with non-core products, a trend that enables venture firms to build on the investment that's already gone into these programs.
"We've seen an increase in the number of spinout opportunities," Healy said. "We're seeing better deal-flow, higher-quality opportunities that have much more clinical data."
One of Sofinnova's recent exits came from Shire PLC's 2010 purchase of Movetis NV, a Belgian company formed around products and technologies licensed from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc. Sofinnova participated in Movetis's Series A round, disclosed in January 2007.
Other recent successes include Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Trius Therapeutics Inc., which went public last year, PregLem Holding SA, acquired by Gedeon Richter PLC late last year, and Vicept Therapeutics Inc., sold to Allergan Inc. in July.
In addition to later-stage drug companies, Sofinnova will consider other types of health-care products that fit the firm's criteria of manageable risk and the potential to make good returns in two to four years, Healy said. Though most of Sofinnova's investments will be in the U.S., the firm also considers companies in Europe and other international markets, he said.
In addition to Healy, the Sofinnova health-care team includes General Partners Garheng Kong and Michael Powell; Partner Anand Mehra; and Executive Partners Lars Ekman and David Kabakoff. The technology team includes General Partner Eric Buatois and Partner Brian Wilcove.

Sofinnova

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search


Sofinnova is the name shared by two venture capital firms, Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners. The name Sofinnova is believed to be a contraction of the French, "Société de Financement de l’Innovation" or, Innovation Venture Capital Company. Both firms trace their roots back to Sofinnova SA, an investment institution founded in Paris in 1972. The two firms have raised ~$4B since inception, and shared a similar investment strategy of investing in the life science and technology sectors. The two sister firms distinguish themselves on the basis of their target geographies, and have been fully independent since 1997.

Sofinnova Ventures has offices in Menlo Park, CA and San Diego, CA and focuses largely on US biotech investments, with ~20% allocation for Europe.
Sofinnova Partners is based in Paris and focuses primarily on European biotech and cleantech investments, with a similar reciprocal allocation for the US.

Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners have had historically some of the same Limited Partners, and have co-invested together in selected companies, including: Flamel, Cerep, Genset, Actelion, Preglem, Movetis, Ascendis, Obseva, Auris and Nucana. Both firms work together in a collegial way to exchange information and due diligence in each other's respective geographies. The firms do not have an obligation to show each other deals or to co-invest, but historically have co-invested together in ~10% of their collective investments.

1970s: The Founding of Sofinnova[edit]

1972 - Sofinnova was founded with the backing of several French financial institutions (most notably Crédit National) and was notable at the time for creating the first "American style" venture capital firm in France. Peter Brooke, the founder of TA Associates, was a board member of Sofinnova SA in its early years. Sofinnova SA quickly established a presence in the European market through the formation of Sofinnova Partners in Paris. Sofinnova SA owned this firm from 1972 until 1997.
1974 - Sofinnova became the first European venture company to enter the US market launching its US affiliate, Sofinnova, Inc (Sofinnova Ventures). Sofinnova co-founder, Jean Deleage, who would later co-found US venture firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co., was appointed the head of the US operation. Sofinnova's US business gained attention for its role as an early backer of Tandem Computers and Genentech in the early 1980s.
1976 - Sofinnova co-founder Jean Deleage established the American subsidiary of Sofinnova, called Sofinnova, Inc., in San Francisco, which eventually became Sofinnova Ventures. Deleage departed Sofinnova in 1979 to co-found another venture capital firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co.. In 1981, working with Deleage, Sofinnova developed a partnership with Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co. and ultimately other US firms. Jean-Bernard Schmidt, who would later serve as Chairman of Sofinnova, was named the head of US operations of Sofinnova, Inc.

1980s: The Early Growth of Sofinnova[edit]

1985 - Sofinnova completed an initial public offering with a listing on the Paris Stock Exchange.
1987 - Alain Azan moved to San Francisco to take over management of Sofinnova Ventures, replacing Jean-Bernard Schmidt. Schmidt would be named Chairman of Sofinnova, retaining that position through 2007. Sofinnova Ventures completed fundraising for SVP I, which was an private equity fund originally intended to invest in European companies expanding in the US. Ultimately, Sofinnova Venture Partners would shift its focus toward investments in domestic US companies.
1989 - Sofinnova Partners completed fundraising for Sofinnova Capital, its first private equity fund in France, with €38M of investor commitments. Sofinnova's investments in this fund include Genset Corporation as well as Cerep, Egide and Flamel.

1990s: The Reorganization of Sofinnova into Sofinnova Partners and Sofinnova Ventures[edit]

1993 - Sofinnova delisted itself from the Paris exchange to raise capital privately through traditional private equity funds. Prior to the 1997 reorganization, Sofinnova Ventures raised three venture funds totaling $57M, and Sofinnova Partners raised funds with €85M in commitments.
1997 - The global Sofinnova organization restructured, formally creating two separate management companies, one for Sofinnova Ventures, and one for Sofinnova Partners. The reorganization was done on the basis of geography, creating Sofinnova Ventures in the US and Sofinnova Partners in Europe. Following a management buyout, each of the management companies was solely owned by its respective management teams.

2000s: The Move to Life Science for Sofinnova[edit]

2000 - Sofinnova Ventures hires Jim Healy, MD, PhD and together he and Mike Powell, PhD rebuilt the Sofinnova Ventures LS brand, with focus on clinical stage drug development companies.
2003 - Sofinnova Ventures started its EIR/Executive Partner program in Life Sciences, with its first EIR Barry Selick. Following this, several other EIRs/Executive Partners joined Sofinnova Ventures from then until 2015, including: Jeff Stein, David Kabakoff, Bill Ringo (Strategic Advisor), Goro Takeda, Jay Shepard, George Horner, Lars Ekman and Dan Welch.
2006 - Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners first sponsored the Sofinnova Biopharm Partnering Conference in Japan, headed up by Sofinnova's Goro Takeda. In 2014, the conference teamed up with Biotechnology Industry Organization, making this the largest biopartnering meeting in Japan.
2007 - SVP VII was raised, which was Sofinnova Ventures' first fund that was overwhelmingly focused on Life Science (80%+), with emphasis on drug development. Their next fund, SVP VIII in 2011 was exclusively (100%) Life Science. At the same time, Sofinnova Partners in Paris moved from a balanced IT/LS venture firm, to one that was predominantly focused on Life Science.
2008 - Sofinnova Ventures made its last IT investment (Enovix). The remaining IT team was active for several years after this to monitor and monetize the final IT investments.

2010s: New Growth Initiatives at Sofinnova[edit]

2010 - Sofinnova Partners started their Green Seed Fund and hired Joško Bobanović to manage this new initiative. In 2012, this seed fund initiative was announced in conjunction with the Sofinnova Capital VII announcement.
2013 - Sofinnova Ventures worked with General Partner Garheng Kong to spin out a new fund, called HealthQuest Capital. HQC's mandate is to provide growth capital to companies transforming healthcare, with a focus on companies other than drug development. HQC raised their second fund, at $225M, in 2016, and transitioned to further independence from the parent Sofinnova Ventures organization.
2017 - Sofinnova Partners announced the first closing of Sofinnova Industrial Biotech I, at €106 million. The fund, dedicated to renewable chemistry, follows a series of 9 investments in the sector since 2009. It will leverage an experienced and dedicated team, initially composed of Denis Lucquin, Managing Partner, Joško Bobanović, Partner, Michael Krel, Principal and Guillaume Baxter, Senior Associate.

1970s: The Founding of Sofinnova[edit]

1972 - Sofinnova was founded with the backing of several French financial institutions (most notably Crédit National) and was notable at the time for creating the first "American style" venture capital firm in France. Peter Brooke, the founder of TA Associates, was a board member of Sofinnova SA in its early years. Sofinnova SA quickly established a presence in the European market through the formation of Sofinnova Partners in Paris. Sofinnova SA owned this firm from 1972 until 1997.
1974 - Sofinnova became the first European venture company to enter the US market launching its US affiliate, Sofinnova, Inc (Sofinnova Ventures). Sofinnova co-founder, Jean Deleage, who would later co-found US venture firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co., was appointed the head of the US operation. Sofinnova's US business gained attention for its role as an early backer of Tandem Computers and Genentech in the early 1980s.
1976 - Sofinnova co-founder Jean Deleage established the American subsidiary of Sofinnova, called Sofinnova, Inc., in San Francisco, which eventually became Sofinnova Ventures. Deleage departed Sofinnova in 1979 to co-found another venture capital firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co.. In 1981, working with Deleage, Sofinnova developed a partnership with Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co. and ultimately other US firms. Jean-Bernard Schmidt, who would later serve as Chairman of Sofinnova, was named the head of US operations of Sofinnova, Inc.

1980s: The Early Growth of Sofinnova[edit]

1985 - Sofinnova completed an initial public offering with a listing on the Paris Stock Exchange.
1987 - Alain Azan moved to San Francisco to take over management of Sofinnova Ventures, replacing Jean-Bernard Schmidt. Schmidt would be named Chairman of Sofinnova, retaining that position through 2007. Sofinnova Ventures completed fundraising for SVP I, which was an private equity fund originally intended to invest in European companies expanding in the US. Ultimately, Sofinnova Venture Partners would shift its focus toward investments in domestic US companies.
1989 - Sofinnova Partners completed fundraising for Sofinnova Capital, its first private equity fund in France, with €38M of investor commitments. Sofinnova's investments in this fund include Genset Corporation as well as Cerep, Egide and Flamel.

1990s: The Reorganization of Sofinnova into Sofinnova Partners and Sofinnova Ventures[edit]

1993 - Sofinnova delisted itself from the Paris exchange to raise capital privately through traditional private equity funds. Prior to the 1997 reorganization, Sofinnova Ventures raised three venture funds totaling $57M, and Sofinnova Partners raised funds with €85M in commitments.
1997 - The global Sofinnova organization restructured, formally creating two separate management companies, one for Sofinnova Ventures, and one for Sofinnova Partners. The reorganization was done on the basis of geography, creating Sofinnova Ventures in the US and Sofinnova Partners in Europe. Following a management buyout, each of the management companies was solely owned by its respective management teams.

2000s: The Move to Life Science for Sofinnova[edit]

2000 - Sofinnova Ventures hires Jim Healy, MD, PhD and together he and Mike Powell, PhD rebuilt the Sofinnova Ventures LS brand, with focus on clinical stage drug development companies.
2003 - Sofinnova Ventures started its EIR/Executive Partner program in Life Sciences, with its first EIR Barry Selick. Following this, several other EIRs/Executive Partners joined Sofinnova Ventures from then until 2015, including: Jeff Stein, David Kabakoff, Bill Ringo (Strategic Advisor), Goro Takeda, Jay Shepard, George Horner, Lars Ekman and Dan Welch.
2006 - Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners first sponsored the Sofinnova Biopharm Partnering Conference in Japan, headed up by Sofinnova's Goro Takeda. In 2014, the conference teamed up with Biotechnology Industry Organization, making this the largest biopartnering meeting in Japan.
2007 - SVP VII was raised, which was Sofinnova Ventures' first fund that was overwhelmingly focused on Life Science (80%+), with emphasis on drug development. Their next fund, SVP VIII in 2011 was exclusively (100%) Life Science. At the same time, Sofinnova Partners in Paris moved from a balanced IT/LS venture firm, to one that was predominantly focused on Life Science.
2008 - Sofinnova Ventures made its last IT investment (Enovix). The remaining IT team was active for several years after this to monitor and monetize the final IT investments.

2010s: New Growth Initiatives at Sofinnova[edit]

2010 - Sofinnova Partners started their Green Seed Fund and hired Joško Bobanović to manage this new initiative. In 2012, this seed fund initiative was announced in conjunction with the Sofinnova Capital VII announcement.
2013 - Sofinnova Ventures worked with General Partner Garheng Kong to spin out a new fund, called HealthQuest Capital. HQC's mandate is to provide growth capital to companies transforming healthcare, with a focus on companies other than drug development. HQC raised their second fund, at $225M, in 2016, and transitioned to further independence from the parent Sofinnova Ventures organization.
2017 - Sofinnova Partners announced the first closing of Sofinnova Industrial Biotech I, at €106 million. The fund, dedicated to renewable chemistry, follows a series of 9 investments in the sector since 2009. It will leverage an experienced and dedicated team, initially composed of Denis Lucquin, Managing Partner, Joško Bobanović, Partner, Michael Krel, Principal and Guillaume Baxter, Senior Associate.

Sofinnova - Wikipedia





















 






Sofinnova

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search


Sofinnova is the name shared by two venture capital firms, Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners. The name Sofinnova is believed to be a contraction of the French, "Société de Financement de l’Innovation" or, Innovation Venture Capital Company. Both firms trace their roots back to Sofinnova SA, an investment institution founded in Paris in 1972. The two firms have raised ~$4B since inception, and shared a similar investment strategy of investing in the life science and technology sectors. The two sister firms distinguish themselves on the basis of their target geographies, and have been fully independent since 1997.

Sofinnova Ventures has offices in Menlo Park, CA and San Diego, CA and focuses largely on US biotech investments, with ~20% allocation for Europe.
Sofinnova Partners is based in Paris and focuses primarily on European biotech and cleantech investments, with a similar reciprocal allocation for the US.

Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners have had historically some of the same Limited Partners, and have co-invested together in selected companies, including: Flamel, Cerep, Genset, Actelion, Preglem, Movetis, Ascendis, Obseva, Auris and Nucana. Both firms work together in a collegial way to exchange information and due diligence in each other's respective geographies. The firms do not have an obligation to show each other deals or to co-invest, but historically have co-invested together in ~10% of their collective investments.
