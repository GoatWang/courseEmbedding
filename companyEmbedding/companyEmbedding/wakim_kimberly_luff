About


Experience


News





Clark Hill is deeply saddened at the passing of our friend and colleague, Kimberly Wakim, on April 28, 2017. We are grateful for her years of dedicated service to our firm, clients and community. We express our heartfelt condolences to Kim's family and to her many friends and colleagues. She will be dearly missed. 
 
Kimberly Luff Wakim focuses her practice in the areas of bankruptcy, creditors’ rights, workouts, and commercial finance and commercial litigation. Kimberly regularly represents creditors, including banks, commercial and consumer finance companies and public and closely held corporations.
She is a frequent lecturer in the areas of bankruptcy and creditors’ rights and related topics. In 2005, and 2008-2016, Kimberly was named a Pennsylvania Super Lawyer, an honor bestowed upon the top five percent of Pennsylvania lawyers.
Kimberly is a Certified Public Accountant. Prior to entering law school, she practiced with the public accounting firm of Main Hurdman, KMG (now KPMG Peat Marwick) and was the Assistant Controller for Petroleum Development Corporation (now PDC Energy), a publicly held oil and gas company. She currently serves as a Corporate Director for PDC Energy and is a member of its Audit Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and Chair of its Compensation Committee.
Immediately after graduating from law school, Kimberly served a two-year term as a law clerk to The Honorable L. Edward Friend II, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Northern District of West Virginia, now retired.
