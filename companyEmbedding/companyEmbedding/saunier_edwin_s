    Heat and hot water in 360°Have you ever given much thought to the heating technology provided by Saunier Duval? Maybe it’s time you did: our brand experience centre in Nantes will give you completely new perspectives as well as an all-round show and amazing insights into our products, going beyond the mere practicalities. You’ll never look at our brand the same way again!
Savoir vivre & savoir chauffer!France is not only the country of savoir vivre – it is also the home of savoir chauffer: the red logo has already been supplying our customers with heat and hot water for over 100 years. The name Saunier Duval is synonymous with long-lasting and convenient, easy-to-use heating technology in France and other European markets. Our brand is certified for its high-quality products: the company meets the ISO standard 9001 for quality, reliability and safety. It is no wonder that Saunier Duval has many loyal customers and is constantly gaining new ones. More than two million heaters bearing the red logo provide a sound service in France – Saunier Duval is the French market leader for condensing boilers and wall-hung gas-fired boilers. The factory in Nantes produces over 400,000 units per year. It goes without saying that the brand offers more than just condensing and gas-fired boilers. The portfolio caters for various customer needs. The plant in Nantes also produces Genia Air heat pumps and manufactures a new solar module for innovative HelioSet and HelioConcept solar systems every two minutes. The Genia Hybrid system is a real highlight, combining the advantages of heat pumps and condensing boilers.By the way: Saunier Duval products are not only loved by the brand’s millions of customers across Europe; installation technicians are also huge fans. The specialists appreciate the fact that Saunier Duval products are particularly easy to fit and can be integrated into existing systems. You have now gained an insight into our brand. How about a 360° view? Come along to the Saunier Duval Experience Centre in Nantes and experience our brand up close in 360 degrees!FacebookTwitterGoogle+
   Reliability, efficiency and comfort – now bundled up into one experience!Over a period spanning more than 100 years, Saunier Duval has become a firm fixture in the lives of the French. With the unique experience centre in Nantes, our brand is now set to win the hearts of our neighbours.360°Saunier Duval Show500 m²presentation area1brand experiencepreviousnext
    See heating technology from a whole new angle. Simply grab it with both hands.In the Nantes factory a great many things have been happening. Visitors stream into the business premises, take a look around and get to grips with the technology: a visit to the experience centre awakens a sense of excitement.
A central theme directs them to the central brandThe Louis-Fonteneau Stadium, belonging to the popular Football Club de Nantes, came up against competition at the start of 2014. A new crowd puller was working its magic just a couple of hundred metres away – although admittedly the crowds here are not quite as vast as those at the stadium. A new destination for weekend tripsEspecially at the weekends, intrigued visitors from the city of Nantes in western France and the surrounding region head over to the centre for a very special experience: they arrive all fired up to learn more about heating and hot water – in a 360° experience, spread over 500 m² and three floors.Everyone is talking about the experience centre, belonging to the traditional heating technology manufacturer Saunier Duval: the company has been a fixed part of daily life in France for more than 100 years. Products with the red logo supply every third home in France with heating and hot water. These products have become such a natural part of life that, apart from specialists, for a long time not many people were interested in what went on behind their white casing or how the technology was developed and manufactured.Heating technology? A hot topic!This has now changed thanks to the brand experience centre: originally created for specialists, more and more members of the general public are now stopping by. The centre takes an everyday object and makes it completely fascinating, staging it in ways you would never expect. Guests of all ages pick up on the central theme at the entrance, which quite literally leads them through the various areas. First stop is the 360° cinema. It is no coincidence that the spectators take a seat on swivel chairs: the 20-minute show is an all-round experience. The brand, products and services of today and times gone by – the narrator knows how to engage an audience, no matter what the topic, and the animations, visual effects and optical tricks are simply magnificent.Getting hands on with the displaysOn the next floor, the visitors have the chance to take a closer look at the Saunier Duval products: heat pumps, solar systems, condensing boilers and more are shown here from their best side. After looking at the products, it is time to get hands on with the various parts. Participants playfully repair prepared appliances, programme control panels, put systems into operation and experience how easy they are to use.This way, visitors can make their own surprising discoveries. They learn about the sophisticated technologies and development processes in detail, through simple, first-hand explanations – and are amazed to discover that their heaters do not just help protect resources and the environment while they are in use, but also during production, sales and when they are recycled. Even more reasons in favour of Saunier Duval.




   




The showroom of the Saunier Duval Experience Centre in Nantes displays the entire range of products offered by the French red brand. Digital datasheets give visitors technical details and explain the benefits of the appliances.








   




The 360° cinema is especially popular: in a thrilling all-round show, which even features a quiz, visitors of all ages find out everything there is to know about our brand, products and services. Audio-visual effects make the presentation an unforgettable experience.








   




In the Experience Room, all visitors have the chance to literally take hold of the technology: teams go head to head in a competition. Which team will be first to assemble spare parts, analyse errors, fit the control unit and start up the system?

Heats in winter, cools in summer   The Genia Air air-water heat pump supplies heat and hot water – and actively cools in summer. A modulating compressor constantly adjusts output. Genia Air is thus highly efficient and yet low-cost to run.
A small revolution in the use of solar energy   HelioSet uses the sun’s energy to generate hot water. The self-draining function is a remarkable advantage which lengthens the system’s lifetime and prevents leaks and malfunctioning. It is activated when the sun is shining but the hot water cylinder is already full to the brim.
A real performer: 109 per cent degree of efficiency   Thema AS Condens is an extremely efficient gas-fired condensing boiler, with a degree of efficiency of up to 109 per cent. The result: exceptionally low consumption levels with correspondingly low heating costs and emissions.
