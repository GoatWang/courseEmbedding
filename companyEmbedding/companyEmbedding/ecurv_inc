eCurv, Inc. Key Developments

eCurv Introduces Constellation's Efficiency Made Easy Program
Sep 29 15
eCurv reported that it will offer Constellation's Efficiency Made Easy (EME) program to commercial clients. The program provides customers the opportunity to fund the installation of eCurv's QPAC (Queued Power Access) software as part of their Constellation electricity supply agreement. Modeled after the digital queuing technology that has enabled the exponential growth in the service capacity of the Mobile Wireless and Information Technology sectors, eCurv's QPAC service automatically queues the access of electric loads, such as HVAC systems, electric pumps, motors, battery charging, heating and refrigeration equipment, thereby avoiding expensive peak demand events. As part of its Efficiency Made Easy program, Constellation commercial and industrial electricity supply customers are able to implement energy efficiency upgrades and other energy management solutions without up-front capital expenditures.
