Announcement




Naturally Wholesome Products LLC is voluntarily recalling gallon and pint containers of Half & Half labeled under the brand name Wholesome Country Creamery due to the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase found in samples during routine testing. Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has received no reports of illnesses related to the affected product and is removing the product from the market out of the abundance of caution.All gallon and pint containers involved in this recall have a batch code of 4052917 or 2060517. Distribution of the affected product was limited in scope. No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are affected by this recall.The company initiated this voluntary recall because, in routine testing, samples of the affected product were found to contain Alkaline Phosphatase, an enzyme naturally present in raw milk but not in milk that has been properly pasteurized. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, during a follow-up investigation of the plant, identified 2 batches of Half & Half that were not pasteurized per the requirements of the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.The recall involves 244 units of the affected product which was distributed only in North Carolina. The company is actively notifying customers and is in the process of retrieving the affected product.How to Identify The Recalled ProductThis recall includes only gallon and pint containers of Half & Half that carry the Wholesome Country Creamery brand name. The containers have a small white sticker reading: 4052917 or 2060517.No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are included in this recall.Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product container to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the company at (336) 468-1520.Because the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase in milk suggests the milk may not have been pasteurized sufficiently, it is possible that pathogens present in the raw milk to begin with, including Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, and/or E. coli, have survived and, if ingested, could cause gastrointestinal infection and its potential ensuing complications.

I ordered a companion headstone for my great-great-grandparents who had been without a headstone for over 70 yrs. I called several companies here in in my area before ordering from you. I was a little hesitant to order over the net and even looked for reviews but found none.	   https://www.honorlife.com/testimonials/i-received-the-stone-at-the-time-promised-delivered-to-my-home-very-well-packaged-and-beautiful

 Your work and craftsmanship is perfect. I want to thank you so much for the footstone marker you made for my daughter's birthday. It was better than I could have imagined. My wife and I decided to get our daughter her footstone for her one year birthday, kind of as a birthday gift if you will. I made the mistake of not ordering it soon enough according to the details on your website. We were worried it wouldn't make it here in time. You made it happen though. Thank You so much, it arrived on her birthday! It was such a wonderful surprise. Our little Angel pasted the day of her birthday. She only got to live a few hours due to some complications during birth. It meant so much to us to be able to give that to her for her birthday. We can't thank you enough. We will be ordering the headstone soon I hope. God Bless	   https://www.honorlife.com/testimonials/i-was-speechless-when-i-first-saw-the-headstone-your-work-and-craftsmanship-is-perfect/

 To all the artisans and craftsmen of Honor Life, and to Jordin Hoden who was extremely understanding at a very grievous time; Outstanding! The angel carving was detailed, the engraved text was perfect, the photos were remarkably precise, the floral/butterfly borders were tasteful, graceful, and elegant, and the polish was the 'piece de resistance', a flawless glasslike finish. A very impressive example of your art. Your work will commemorate the type of relationship Julie and I shared, for centuries, perhaps..... forever. You have my sincere thanks, and hearty endorsement.	   https://www.honorlife.com/testimonials/stone-work-finest-quality/

 Thank you, and all of your staff so much for such a speedy production & delivery of our headstone!!!! It is absolutely beautiful! Headstones & Memorials really does 'Quality' work! Even the girl at the cemetery who assisted me during delivery said it was fantastic. She asked me why I didn't order through them, and I told her because no one could do the graphics that I wanted, and that was one reason I went with your company. And, another was price. She was very impressed with your work. You guys are a 5 star rating in my book !!!!! ★★★★★	   https://www.honorlife.com/testimonials/honor-life-really-does-quality-work/

 We were a bit hesitant about ordering online. Just wanted to drop you a note and tell you how thrilled my mom and I were with the headstone we ordered for my sister. It is absolutely beautiful -- sweet and simple -- and I am so grateful that we were able to afford such a lovely stone for her. Even the cemetery personnel were impressed with the quality of the headstone and asked where I had gotten it. I expect that they will be referring many other families to your site. We couldn't be more pleased and, with your reasonable pricing and incredible service, I hope to provide markers for other family members whose graves are still unmarked.

 I would like to thank you so very much for the beautiful job you did on my brother's marker. When people lose a loved one it's hard to go to the monument makers and visualize what you're ordering. By going online, I was able to see exactly what I was getting. It was so much easier and much less in cost, the wait wasn't even that long, once I placed the order. I'm sure the rest of the family will be as pleased as I am. Thank you again for a beautiful marker for our special brother. Sincerely Grateful.	   https://www.honorlife.com/testimonials/i-was-very-impressed-not-only-with-the-price-but-with-the-way-it-was-done/

 I appreciate the no tax and shipping charge, not to mention the reasonable prices. I just want to thank you and the company for the ease in selecting a gravestone for my grandfather. There was no headstone for him since 1930. Our family had moved away from Worland, Wyoming in 1943. It was recently that I found out there was no headstone after all these years. I ordered the headstone Sept. 4, and it was delivered on Sept. 20 to the mortuary that will do the setting. Also thanks for the tracking number updates. It was great to order from Los Angeles and have it shipped to Wyoming without worrying about it. Thanks again.	   https://www.honorlife.com/testimonials/your-web-site-is-very-easy-to-order-from-and-i-appreciate-the-no-tax-and-shipping-charge-not-to-mention-the-reasonable-prices/

The marker preparation and shipping was handled in a very timely manner, and the delivery man put it where I could easily handle it. I set the marker on Thursday, Sept 11, 2012 and it looks great (see picture) on the headstone concrete slab. Your organization can take pride in having prepared the recognition marker that will keep him in remembrance by his family for generations to come.	   https://www.honorlife.com/testimonials/just-wanted-send-note-thank-great-job-handling-memorial-marker-great-uncle-john/

If God is for us, who can ever be against us? Romans 8:31 (NLT)





Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. John 15:13 (NIV)





A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. Proverbs 17:17 (NIV)





Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. Psalm 34:8 (NIV)





One thing I ask of the LORD, this is what I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all
the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple. Psalm 27:4 (NIV)





"For I know the plans I have for you," says the Lord. "They are plans for good and not for
disaster, to give you a future and a hope." - Jeremiah 29:11 (NLT)





The name of the Lord is a strong fortress; the godly run to him and are safe. Proverbs 18:10 (NLT)





And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God
and are called according to his purpose for them. Romans 8:28 (NLT)





And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below—indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 8:38-39 (NLT)





But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as
eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. Isaiah 40:31 (KJV)

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
