This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Phillip D. Joseph Jr., a 1990 graduate of DePauw University, has been appointed chief financial officer of Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (SRC). In his new role, which he takes on April 20, Joseph will "oversee all aspects of finance, corporate reporting, tax and investor relations, and will focus, in particular, on Spirit's capital markets and key stakeholder engagement activities," notes an announcement from the real estate investment trust (REIT).

"Formerly, Mr. Joseph spent more than 13 years at Prologis, a leading owner, operator and developer of industrial real estate, most recently as managing director and global treasurer."
"We are extremely pleased that Phil has agreed to join us as CFO," says Thomas H. Nolan, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Spirit Realty Capital. "We will rely on Phil's extensive capital markets expertise and proven financial acumen as we enhance our position as one of the premier net-lease REITs in the industry."
An economics and management major at DePauw, Phil Joseph earned his M.B.A. from the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
