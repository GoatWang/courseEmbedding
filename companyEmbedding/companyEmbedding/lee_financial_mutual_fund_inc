Lee Financial Tactical Fund

For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar™ calculates as Morningstar Rating™ base on a Morninstar Risk-Adjusted Return™ measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a fund is delivered from a weighted  average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. Lee Financial Tactical Fund (LOVIX) was rated against the following U.S. domiciled Tactical Allocation funds over the following time periods: 284 funds in the last three years, 188 funds in the last five years. With respect to these Tactical Allocation funds, Lee Financial Tactical Fund (LOVIX) received a Morningstar Rating™ of 5 stars for the 3-year period and 4 stars for the 5-year period ended June 30, 2016. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Losses hurt more than equivalent gains help. ™
At Lee Financial Group Hawaii, we believe that many investors are seeking low volatility investments to help them manage risk. That’s why we created the Lee Financial Tactical Fund (LOVIX). The objective of LOVIX is to achieve long-term capital appreciation and preservation of capital while lowering volatility.
Low-volatility doesn’t necessarily mean low returns. There is ample evidence that low-volatility investing offers consistent relative growth and returns while sparing investors some of the headaches and worry of chasing volatile stocks in hopes of scoring a quick profit. Low volatility investing isn’t about the mindless pursuit of fast returns. It’s about attempting to minimize uncertainty while attempting to build a portfolio with less risk.
Investment Objective
The investment objective of the Lee Financial Tactical Fund is to achieve long-term capital appreciation and preservation of capital while lowering volatility.
(Click to read the LOVIX Fund Fact Sheet)
The LOVIX portfolio may invest in a range of asset classes from markets in the United States and throughout the world. LOVIX is managed by Terrence Lee, President and CEO of Lee Financial Group Hawaii, Inc.
Lee Financial Securities, Inc./Distributor
Before investing, read the prospectus carefully. Please carefully consider the Fund’s investment objective, risks, and charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund. Obtain a free prospectus here. 
Fund’s yield, share price and investment return fluctuate so that you may receive more or less than your original investment upon redemption. Low volatility investing does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a generally declining market. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The Lee Financial Tactical Fund is a series of Lee Financial Mutual Fund, Inc.
Mutual fund investing involves risks. Principal loss is possible. The Lee Financial Tactical Fund’s investments in structured notes may subject the Fund to greater interest rate, credit and counterparty risks and costs than traditional equity funds. The price of structured notes may be volatile and they may have a limited trading market, making it difficult to value or sell them. Structured notes are also subject to risks of debt instruments, including interest rate and call risks, but may have a greater risk of loss than a typical debt security of the same maturity and credit quality. In exchange for the issuer’s guarantee of full or partial payment of principal on maturity, the upside return the Fund could achieve on its investment may be capped or limited and the issuer’s guarantee is generally available only if the Fund holds the structured note to maturity. The Fund may also invest in options which may be more volatile and less liquid, increasing the risk of loss when compared to traditional securities. The Fund also invests in foreign securities which, especially in emerging markets, involve greater volatility and political, economic, regulatory and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund may invest in small, mid or large companies. Investment in smaller companies involves additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies. The Fund’s investments in other investment companies, including exchange traded funds, subjects the Fund to those risks affecting that investment company, including a possible decrease in the value of the underlying securities. The Fund will also incur brokerage costs when it purchases exchange traded funds and will incur its pro rata share of the underlying investment company’s expenses. This is not a complete list of risks that may affect the Fund. For additional information concerning the risks applicable to the Fund, please see the Fund’s prospectus.

November 20, 2006                                                               

Dear fellow shareholder,                                                        

      As we begin our 19th year of operations, we are pleased to provide you
with our Funds' 2006 Annual Report.                                             

      In these uncertain financial times, isn't it comforting to know that you
are invested in the Hawaii Municipal Fund and the Hawaii Intermediate Fund?  As 
shareholders of the Funds, you are earning tax-free income* and supporting      
local projects designed to enrich our community.  The money raised through      
municipal bonds is commonly used to build schools, hospitals, roads, airports,  
harbors, and water and electrical systems that serve to create jobs and improve 
the quality of life here in our islands.                                        

      On the following pages are line graphs comparing each Fund's performance
to the Lehman Muni Bond Index for the 10 years ended September 30, 2006, or the 
inception of the Fund if less than 10 years.  Each graph assumes a hypothetical 
$10,000 investment in the respective Fund.  The object of the graphs is to      
permit a comparison of the Funds with a benchmark and to provide perspective on 
market conditions and investment strategies and techniques that materially      
affected the performance of each Fund.                                          

    Interest rates are the most important of many factors which can affect
bond prices.  Over the course of the fiscal year, the treasury yield curve      
flattened with short-term interest rates rising by 1.50% and long-term interest 
rates slightly increasing.  This accounts for the Hawaii Municipal Fund's       
fiscal year price change of $0.06.  The Hawaii Municipal Fund Investor Class    
had a Net Asset Value ("NAV") of $11.10 on October 1, 2005 and a NAV of $11.04  
on September 30, 2006.  The Hawaii Municipal Fund Institutional Class had a NAV 
of $11.11 on October 1, 2005 and a NAV of $11.05 on September 30, 2006.  The    
rise in short term-rates resulted in the Hawaii Intermediate Fund's fiscal year 
price change of $0.03.  The Hawaii Intermediate Fund had a NAV of $5.18 of      
October 1, 2005 and a NAV of $5.15 on September 30, 2006.  The primary          
investment strategy of the Hawaii Municipal Fund is to purchase high quality    
long-term Hawaii municipal bonds.  The primary investment strategy of the       
Hawaii Intermediate Fund is to purchase high quality three to ten year Hawaii   
municipal bonds.  The past year's performance for these Funds, which is         
presented in this Annual Report, was primarily a result of the implementation   
of these strategies.  As of September 30, 2006, 87.27% of the Hawaii Municipal  
Bond Fund's portfolio was invested in bonds rated AAA by Standard & Poor's      
("S&P").  As of September 30, 2006, 76.58% of the Hawaii Intermediate Fund's    
portfolio was invested in bonds rated AAA by S&P.                               

       During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Federal Reserve Bank
increased the Federal Funds Rate from 3.75% to 5.25%.  Despite this increase in 
short term rates, the ten year treasury bond's yield rose by only .22%.  In our 
opinion, the market's relatively mild reaction suggests that these actions,     
among other market events, will keep inflation pressures under control for the  
foreseeable future.  The modest increase in rates at the long end of the yield  
curve can be interpreted as an indication that bond investors believe inflation 
will not greatly increase over the long-term.  Still, there continues to be     
risks to inflation and the bond market, among which are US fiscal policy,       
international conflicts/terrorism and global economic factors.

earned in 2006 were both state and federal tax-free.*   There are no capital    
gain distributions for the Hawaii Intermediate Fund for the 2006 calendar year. 
There will be a long-term capital gain distribution for the 2006 calendar year  
to shareholders of the Hawaii Municipal Fund.

performance of the Fund with the current market and to give perspective to      
market conditions and investment strategies and techniques pursued by the       
investment manager that materially affected the performance of the Fund.  The

Your Fund's Expenses                                                            
As a Fund shareholder, you can incur two types of costs:                        
* Transaction costs, including sales charges (loads) on Fund purchases and      
redemption fees; and                                                            
* Ongoing Fund costs, including management fees, distribution and service (12b- 
1) fees, and other Fund expenses.  All mutual funds have ongoing costs,         
sometimes referred to as operating expenses.                                    

The following table shows ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and can help   
you understand these costs and compare them with those of other mutual funds.   
The table assumes a $1,000 investment held for the six months indicated.        

Actual Fund Expenses                                                            
The first line (Actual) for each share class listed in the table below provides 
actual account values and expenses.  The "Ending Account Value" is derived from 
the Fund's actual return, which includes the effect of Fund expenses.           

You can estimate the expenses you paid during the period, by following these    
steps.  Of course, your account value and expenses will differ from those in    
this illustration:                                                              

1.  Divide your account value by $1,000.                                      
If an account had an $8,600 value, the $8,600 /$1,000 = 8.6.          

2.  Multiply the result by the number under the heading "Expenses Paid During 
Period."                                                              
If expenses Paid During Period were $7.50, then 8.6 x $7.50 = $64.50. 

In this illustration, the estimated expenses paid this period are $64.50.       

Hypothetical example for Comparison with Other Funds                            
Information in the second line (Hypothetical) for each class in the table can   
help you compare ongoing costs of investing in the Fund with those of other     
mutual funds.  This information may not be used to estimate the actual ending   
account balance or expenses you paid during the period.  The hypothetical       
"Ending Account Value" is based on the actual expense ratio for each class and  
an assumed 5% annual rate of return before expenses, which does not represent   
the Fund's actual return.  The figure under the heading "Expenses Paid During   
Period" shows the hypothetical expenses your account would have incurred under  
this scenario.  You can compare this figure with the 5% hypothetical examples   
that appear in shareholder reports of other funds.                              

Please note that expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight ongoing     
costs and do not reflect any transaction costs, such as sales charges or        
redemption fees.  Therefore, the second line for each class is useful in        
comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you compare total costs of      
owning different funds.  Please refer to the Fund prospectus for additional     
information on operating expenses.

Hypothetical                     $1,000.00      $1,022.05         $2.98         

Hawaii Intermediate Fund

*Expenses are equal to the annualized expense ratio for each class (.91%, .59%  
and .61%, respectively), multiplied by the average account value over the       
period, multiplied by 183/365 to reflect the one-half year period.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors                                      
First Pacific Mutual Fund, Inc.                                                 
Honolulu, Hawaii                                                                

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of Hawaii 
Municipal Fund and Hawaii Intermediate Fund (each a series of shares of First   
Pacific Mutual Fund, Inc. (the "Funds")), including the schedules of            
investments, as of September 30, 2006, and the related statements of operations 
for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of    
the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for the     
periods indicated thereon.  These financial statements and financial highlights 
are the responsibility of the Funds' management.  Our responsibility is to      
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based 
on our audits.                                                                  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company  
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).   Those standards require that we   
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the     
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material              
misstatement.   The Funds are not required to have, nor were we engaged to      
perform, an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.      
Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting  
as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the           
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the          
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.          
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.   An audit also includes examining, on 
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial  
statements.   Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of    
September 30, 2006, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by      
other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers were not       
received.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and  
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall     
financial statement presentation.   We believe that our audits provide a        
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly in all material respects, the financial position of Hawaii 
Municipal Fund and Hawaii Intermediate Fund as of September 30, 2006, the       
results of their operations for the year then ended, the changes in their net   
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial     
highlights for each of the periods indicated thereon, in conformity with        
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

HAWAII INTERMEDIATE FUND                                                        
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
September 30, 2006
(1)     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                              

Hawaii Municipal Fund and Hawaii Intermediate Fund ("Funds") are each a         
series of shares of First Pacific Mutual Fund, Inc. which is registered         
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as a non-diversified open-end         
management company.   Hawaii Municipal Fund is authorized to offer two          
Classes of Shares:   Investor Shares and Institutional Shares.   The Classes    
offer different distribution charges and shareholder servicing fees which       
may affect performance.                                                         

The investment objective of the Funds is to provide a high level of current     
income exempt from federal and Hawaii state income taxes, consistent with       
preservation of capital and prudent investment management.  The Funds seek      
to achieve their objective by investing primarily in municipal securities       
which pay interest that is exempt from federal and Hawaii income taxes.         

The Funds are subject to the risk of price fluctuation of the municipal         
securities held in their portfolios which is generally a function of the        
underlying credit rating of an issuer, the maturity length of the               
securities, the securities' yield, and general economic and interest rate       
conditions.                                                                     

Since the Funds invest primarily in obligations of issuers located in           
Hawaii, the marketability and market value of these obligations may be          
affected by certain Hawaiian constitutional provisions, legislative             
measures, executive orders, administrative regulations, voter initiatives,      
and other political and economic developments.   If any such problems arise,    
they could adversely affect the ability of various Hawaiian issuers to meet     
their financial obligation.                                                     

In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles      
generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes            
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and        
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported    
amounts of income and expenses during the reported period.   Actual results     
could differ from those estimates.                                              

(A)   SECURITY VALUATION                                                        
       Portfolio securities, which are fixed income securities, are valued by an
       independent pricing service using market quotations, prices provided by
     market-makers, or estimates of market values obtained from yield data
      relating to instruments or securities with similar characteristics, in
    accordance with procedures established in good faith by the Board of
        Directors.   Securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
        valued on the amortized cost basis as reflecting fair value.  Securities
       for which market quotations are not readily available will be valued at
        their "fair value" in good faith. For these purposes, "fair value" means
        the price that the Fund Accountant and the Investment Manager reasonably
       expect the Fund could receive from an arm's-length buyer upon the current
   sale of the securities within seven (7) days, after considering all
     appropriate factors and indications of value available to them.  Such
       value will be cost if the Investment Manager determines such valuation is
       appropriate after considering a multitude of factors in accordance with
established procedures.

(B)   FEDERAL INCOME TAXES                                                      
       It is the Funds' policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute their taxable income, if any, to their shareholders. 
      Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.   At September

   appreciation is attributable to market discount on debt securities.

        Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
     require that certain components of net assets be reclassified between
       financial and tax reporting.  These reclassifications have no effect on
     net assets or net asset value per share.  During the year, the Hawaii
 Municipal Fund's undistributed investment income was decreased by
     $3,134, undistributed capital gain was decreased by $154, and paid in
capital was increased by $3,288.

the Funds.  The Hawaii Municipal Fund Institutional Class will not incur any    
distribution costs.

Disclosure Regarding Approval of the Management Agreement       

At a meeting held on July 25, 2006, the Board of Directors First Pacific Mutual 
Fund, Inc. ("Fund") considered and approved the continuance of the Investment   
Management Agreement between the Fund and Lee Financial Group Inc. ("LFG") with 
respect to the Hawaii Municipal Fund and the Hawaii Intermediate Fund (each a   
"Portfolio" and collectively, the "Portfolios") for an additional one-year      
period ending September 30, 2007.                                               

Prior to the meeting, the Directors had received detailed information from LFG. 
This information together with other information provided by LFG and the        
information provided to the Directors throughout the course of year formed the  
primary (but not exclusive) basis for the Board's determinations as summarized  
below. The information, material factors and conclusions that formed the basis  
for the Board's subsequent approval of the Investment Management Agreement are  
described below.                                                                

1. Information Received                                                         

Materials reviewed - During the course of the year, the Directors received a    
wide variety of materials relating to the services provided by LFG, including   
reports on each Portfolio's investment results; portfolio composition;          
portfolio trading practices; and other information relating to the nature,      
extent and quality of services provided by LFG to the Fund.  In addition, the   
Board reviewed supplementary information that included materials regarding each 
Portfolio's investment results, management fee and expense comparisons,         
financial and profitability information regarding LFG, descriptions of various  
functions such as compliance monitoring and portfolio trading practices, and    
information about the personnel providing investment management and             
administrative services to each Portfolio.                                      

Review Process. The Board received assistance regarding legal and industry      
standards from independent counsel to the independent Directors. The Board      
discussed the renewal of the agreement with LFG representatives.  In deciding   
to recommend the renewal of the agreement, the Directors did not identify any   
single issue or particular information that, in isolation, was the controlling  
factor. This summary describes the most important, but not all, of the factors  
considered by the Board.                                                        

2. Nature, Extent and Quality of Services                                       

In the Board's review of LFG, its personnel and its resources, it considered    
the depth and quality of LFG's investment management process; the experience,   
capability and integrity of its senior management and other personnel; the      
turnover rates of its personnel; and the overall financial strength and         
stability of its organization.  Based on this review, the Board determined that 
LFG has the capabilities, resources and personnel necessary to manage the Fund  
and the Board is satisfied with the quality of services provided by LFG in      
advising the Portfolios.                                                        

3. Investment Performance                                                       

The Board considered each Portfolio's unique, balanced pursuit of its           
investment objectives and the investment results of each Portfolio in light of  
its objectives.  The Directors reviewed the short-term and long-term            
performance of each Portfolio on both an absolute basis and in comparison to    
benchmark indices. The Directors also reviewed the rankings for each of the     
Portfolios by an independent rating and ranking organization.  Based on that    
review, the Board concluded that the performance of each of the Portfolios is   
generally competitive with their benchmark index and other comparable mutual    
funds.

4. Management Fees and Total Operating Expenses                                 

The Board reviewed the management fees and total operating expenses of each     
Portfolio and compared such amounts with the industry average fees and expense  
levels of other comparable Funds.  The Board concluded that:  the management    
fees for each Portfolio, both before and after voluntary fee waivers and/or     
expense offsets, are generally competitive with fees paid by comparable funds   
and are reasonable as compared to LFG's other similarly managed clients; and    
the expense ratio of each Portfolio is generally competitive with the expenses  
paid by comparable funds.                                                       

5. Adviser, Costs, Level of Profits, Economies of Scale and Ancillary Benefits  

The Board reviewed information regarding LFG's costs of providing services to   
the Fund, as well as the resulting level of profits to LFG.  The Board further  
concluded that the profit to LFG for investment management services seems       
reasonable based on the services provided.  The Board noted that since the      
management fees do not contain breakpoints, there would be no economies of      
scale from reduction of the management fees as the Portfolios' assets grow. In  
assessing the benefits to LFG from its relationships with the Fund, the Board   
noted that there are no soft dollar arrangements.  The Board also took into     
account potential benefits to LFG as the Fund's administrator and the           
engagement of affiliates for distribution, shareholder servicing and transfer   
agency services and concluded that the management fee for each Portfolio was    
reasonable in relation to the benefits derived by LFG from these relationships. 

6. Conclusions                                                                  

No single factor was determinative of the Board's decision to re-approve the    
Investment Management Agreement, but rather the Directors based their           
determination on the total mix of information available to them. Based on their 
review, including their consideration of each of the factors referred to above, 
the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, concluded that the       
Investment Management Agreement, and the compensation is determined to be fair  
and reasonable in light of such services provided and expenses incurred under   
the Agreement.

Fund Objective:  The investment seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation and preservation of capital while lowering volatility.

Methodology:  The fund normally invests primarily in equity securities of U.S. companies. Under normal circumstances, it will allocate a portion of its total assets to structured notes, which are specially designed debt instruments, the terms of which are determined by the purchaser or issuer, and whose principal or interest payments may be linked to, and whose value would rise or fall in response to, the value of an index, a basket of securities, interest rate benchmark or other financial asset. The fund is non-diversified.

SHAREHOLDER SERVICES AGREEMENT        

  AGREEMENT dated March 16, 1994, amended, January 29, 1996, and
January 21, 1998, between First Pacific Recordkeeping, Inc. ("FPR"), a          
Hawaii Corporation and First Pacific Mutual Fund, Inc. (the "Corporation"),     
a Maryland Corporation.  First Hawaii Municipal Bond Fund series, First         
Hawaii Intermediate Municipal Fund series and First Idaho Tax-Free Fund         
series are series of the Corporation operated as open-end, non-diversified      
management investment companies.  All references to any series of the           
Corporation will be called the "Fund" unless expressly noted otherwise.         

WITNESSETH:     

WHEREAS, each Fund is a non-diversified, open-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,         
as amended (the "1940 Act");  and                                               

       WHEREAS, FPR serves as Transfer Agent to each Fund under a separate
Transfer Agent Agreement and each Fund desires to avail itself of certain       
administrative services provided by FPR with regard to personal services of     
shareholder accounts which are not covered by the Transfer Agent Agreement;     
and                                                                             

     WHEREAS, FPR is willing to furnish such services on the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth.                                               

      NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound,
hereby agree as follows:                                                        

      Section 1.     Each Fund hereby appoints FPR to administer certain
of the affairs of each Fund for the period and on the terms set forth in        
this Agreement.  FPR hereby accepts such appointment and agrees during such     
period to render the services herein described and to assume the obligations    
set forth herein, for the compensation herein provided.                         

      Section 2.     FPR shall provide personal servicing of shareholder
accounts, which may include telephone and written conversations, assistance     
in redemptions, exchanges, transfers and opening accounts as may be required    
from time to time.  FPR shall, in addition, provide such additional             
administrative management services as it and each Fund may from time to         
time agree.                                                                     

     Section 3.     First Pacific Management Corporation shall oversee
all relationships between the Fund and its Custodian, Transfer Agent and any    
accounting services agents, including the supervision of the performance of     
the Fund's agreements with such parties.                                        

Section 4.     The accounts and records maintained by FPR shall be the
property of each Fund and shall be made available to each Fund within a         
reasonable period of time, upon demand.  FPR shall assist each Fund's           
independent auditors, or upon approval of each Fund, or upon demand, any        
regulatory body, in any requested review of each Fund's accounts and records    
but shall be reimbursed for all expenses and employee time invested in any      
such review outside of routine and normal periodic reviews.  FPR shall          
supply the necessary data for each Fund's completion of any necessary tax       
returns, questionnaires, periodic reports to shareholders and such other        
reports and information requests as each Fund and FPR shall agree upon from     
time to time.                                                                   

 Section 5.     FPR may rely upon the advice of each Fund and counsel to
each Fund and upon statements of each Fund's accountants and other persons      
believed by it in good faith to be expert in matters upon which they are        
consulted, and FPR shall not be liable for any actions taken in good faith      
upon such statements.                                                           

   Section 6.     FPR shall not be liable for any action taken in good faith
reliance upon any authorized Oral Instructions, any Written Instructions and    
certified copy of any resolution of the Board of Directors of each Fund or      
any other document reasonably believed by FPR to be genuine and to have been    
executed or signed by the proper person or persons.                             

 Section 7.     Each Fund shall indemnify and hold FPR harmless from any
and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, liabilities, actions, demands and     
losses whatsoever arising out of or in connection with any error, omission,     
inaccuracy or other deficiency of any information provided to FPR by each       
Fund, or the failure of each Fund to provide any information needed by FPR      
knowledgeably to perform its functions hereunder.  Also, each Fund shall        
indemnify and hold harmless FPR from all claims and liabilities (including      
reasonable expenses for legal counsel) incurred by or assessed against FPR      
in connection with the performance of this Agreement, except such as may        
arise from FPR's own negligent action, omission or willful misconduct;          
provided, however, that before confessing any claim against it, FPR shall       
give the Fund reasonable opportunity to defend against such claim in the        
name of the Fund or FPR or both.                                                

Section 8.     As full compensation for the services performed by FPR,
First Hawaii Municipal Bond Fund shall pay FPR a fee at the annualized rate     
of .10 of one percent (.10%) of the average daily net assets of the Fund.       
This fee will be computed daily and be paid monthly within ten (10) business    
days after the last six (6) days of each month.  This fee shall be prorated     
for any fraction of a month at the commencement or termination of this          
Agreement.  First Hawaii Intermediate Municipal Fund and First Idaho            
Tax-Free Fund will not pay FPR any fees.                                        

Section 9.     Except as required by laws and regulations governing   
investment companies, nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to        
or shall require FPR, in any capacity hereunder, to perform any functions       
or duties on any holiday or other day of special observance on which FPR        
is closed.  Functions or duties normally scheduled to be performed on such      
days shall be performed on, and as of, the next business day on which both      
each Fund and FPR are open.                                                     

Section 10.    Either each Fund or FPR may give written notice to the 
other of the termination of this Agreement, such termination to take effect     
at the time specified in the notice, which time shall be not less than sixty    
(60) days from the giving of such notice.  Such termination shall be without    
penalty.                                                                        

    Section 11.    This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed to be an original, but such    
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.         

 Section 12.    This Agreement shall extend to and shall be binding upon
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;  provided,      
however, that this Agreement shall not be assignable by FPR without the         
approval of each Fund by a resolution of its Board of Directors.                

  Section 13.    This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Hawaii.                                                                      

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
signed by their duly authorized officers as of the day and year first above     
written.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
