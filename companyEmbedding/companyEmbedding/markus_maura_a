SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bank of the West today announced that Maura Markus has joined the bank 
      as President and Chief Operating Officer.
    


      Markus joins Bank of the West following a 22-year career at Citigroup, 
      where she served most recently as head of its International Retail Bank 
      and from 2000 to 2007 as president of Citibank North America, 
      responsible for a 1,000-branch retail network serving six million 
      consumers and 300,000 small business customers. In this position, she 
      also served as chairman of Citibank West, which included more than 370 
      branches in California.
    

      “Maura Markus is a leader in our industry with an outstanding record of 
      corporate accomplishments and civic involvement, which makes her a 
      tremendous addition to our leadership team,” Bank of the West Chairman 
      and CEO Michael Shepherd said.
    

      Markus will oversee Bank of the West’s revenue-generating business 
      groups: Commercial Banking, National Finance, Wealth Management and the 
      Regional Banking Group, comprised of nearly 700 branch and commercial 
      banking locations in the Western United States. She will also oversee 
      the bank’s marketing department.
    

      “Bank of the West is strong and poised for growth. It has a compelling 
      value proposition, setting itself apart through outstanding service and 
      financial strength,” Markus said. “Bank of the West’s solid core 
      businesses combined with the strength of its parent BNP Paribas position 
      it well for future success. It is an exciting time to be joining Bank of 
      the West.”
    

      Markus has served as an executive board member for Junior Achievement 
      New York since 2000 and as a board member of Catholic Charities of New 
      York since 2006. She has been recognized as one of the top women in 
      banking by US Banker magazine in four of the past seven years.
    

      Markus holds an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, and a B.A. in 
      Sociology from Boston College.
