Description

                    Susan Sontag (1933-2004) was one of America's first celebrity intellectuals. In the first biography to be published since her death, Daniel Schreiber portrays a glamorous woman full of contradictions and inner conflicts, whose life mirrored the cultural upheavals of her time. While known primarily as a cultural critic and novelist, Sontag was also a filmmaker, stage director, and dramatist. It was her status as a pop icon that was unusual for an American intellectual: she was filmed by Andy Warhol and Woody Allen, photographed by Annie Leibovitz and Diane Arbus, and her likeness adorned advertisements for Absolut vodka. Drawing on newly available sources, including interviews with Nadine Gordimer, Robert Wilson, and Sontag's son, David Rieff, as well as on myriad interviews given by Sontag and her extensive correspondence with her friend and publisher Roger Straus, Schreiber explores the roles that Sontag played in influencing American public cultural and political conversations.show more

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREEmil Nolde: The Grotesquesby Nolde, Emil (Art)/ Luckhardt, Ulrich (Edt)/ Ring, Christian (Edt)/ Dieterich, Caroline/ Schreiber, Daniel J.Emil Nolde (1867-1956) is famous for his dramatic ocean views and colorful flower gardens, but his love of the fantastical and grotesque has received less attention. Yet it is clear from his autobiography and his letters that they had a significant impact on his art. Alongside his first oil painting, "Bergriesen" ("Mountain Giants," 1895-96), his alpine postcards of this period, in which the Swiss mountains appear as bizarre human physiognomies, also convey his fascination with the fantastical. His rejection of realism in favor of a grotesque, alternative world can be seen throughout his oeuvre, from its beginnings to the Grotesken (1905) and watercolors from 1918-19, to the years under the Nazis when he was forbidden to practice his profession. This catalog, which includes works never before shown, is also the first to emphasize this fascinating side of the great painter and water-colorist.Collections, Catalogs, ExhibitionsCondition: NewHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
