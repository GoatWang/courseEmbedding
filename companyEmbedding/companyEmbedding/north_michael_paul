Our Story

Recognizing a shift in the marketplace, the decline of the American dollar, as well as the need to recycle; the Paul Michael Company began its’ biggest endeavor to date by manufacturing its’ own line of accessories and furniture that Paul designs. He felt that the only way the company would be able to separate itself from the market would be to create its’ own line of exclusive items that Paul feels will be the antiques of tomorrow. Today we refer to these original designs as Paul’s World ~reclaim, reuse, recycle, redecorate~ everything is 100% American made and the majority of items are constructed of architectural salvage and reclaimed wood that Paul has been collecting for years.  In Dermott, AR the Paul Michael Company now has a woodshop buzzing 7 days a week, developing, manufacturing and designing amazing pieces for your home.
We take pride in offering Paul Michael Company Exclusives, pieces designed by our founder and handcrafted at our Dermott, AR woodshop, to our customers looking for one-of-a-kind offerings to adorn their homes.

Not only are there multiple parties that can be held liable for your injuries, but there are also a variety of different types of product liability claims. When it comes to determining the specific type of product liability involved, there are three basic options:Strict Liability – It does not matter how careful you are, the mere fact that the product is defective holds the other party liable for your injuries.Negligence – One or more parties in the manufacturing chain was negligent and caused the product to be defective, which resulted in your injuries.Breach of Warranty – Either written or expressed verbally, in advertising or in person, a warranty tells you that the product should be safe for its intended use. If the product is defective, the warranty is breached and another party can be held liable for your injuries.In addition to all these various product liability factors, each state has different rules and regulations regarding the type of product liability claim you are able to file. However, all product liability claims must show that the product was defective for one reason or another. There are several different types of product defects:Design Defects – Before the product is even made, the design causes the product to be defective.Manufacturing Defects – defects occur while the product is being created.  Often times, this only causes a couple products to be defective, rather than every product created.Marketing Defect – A marketing defect is a defect in the directions or warnings of dangers or uses.  This can include a missing line in the instructions or even a typo.Due to the complexity of a product liability claim, it is important that you contact an experienced North Carolina product liability lawyer if you are filing a product liability claim.  A product liability lawyer will inform you of the rules and regulations regarding Product Liability in your area.Frequently Asked Product Liability Questions Defective Children’s ProductsContact the Law Offices of Michael A.
