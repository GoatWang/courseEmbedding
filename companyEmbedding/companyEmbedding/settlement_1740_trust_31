Milking It
Social media rumors about a class action settlement for people who bought milk are only partially accurate.














            2K        












  

CLAIM

    Anyone who bought milk after 2003 can be compensated under the terms of a class action lawsuit.    








MIXTURE




RATING


MIXTURE


WHAT'S TRUE

Individuals who bought milk after 2003 in 15 states and the District of Columbia may be entitled to receive compensation due to a class action settlement; the deadline to submit a claim passed on 31 January 2017.

WHAT'S FALSE

Residents of most states are not part of the class eligible to be compensated under this settlement.  
ORIGIN
In September 2016, social media users began circulating links to a web site (BoughtMilk.com) and asserting that anyone who had purchased milk after the year 2003 was eligible to participate in a class action lawsuit. As reported at the time, a settlement had been reached in an anti-trust class-action suit accusing dairy producers of artificially boosting milk prices:
Major United States dairy producers will pay $52 million to settle an antitrust class-action lawsuit accusing them of slaughtering more than 500,000 cows to reduce milk supply and inflate prices.
“This cow-killing program exploited both the animals and the consumers, and resulted in the early deaths of half a million cows,” attorney Cheryl Leahy told The Huffington Post in an email. Leahy is general counsel for Compassion Over Killing, an animal protection group that spearheaded the suit … Class action firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP filed the suit in 2011 on behalf of dairy consumers, against dairy lobbying group National Milk Producers Federation and industry cooperatives Dairy Farmers of America, Land O’ Lakes, DairyLea Cooperative and Agrimark.
In January 2017, news reports about the milk class action settlement appeared regularly because the deadline for affected consumers to request a share of that settlement was set at 31 January 2017. However, many social media users only saw headlines and brief descriptions which did not typically contain the specifics of the settlement or its restrictions.
BoughtMilk.com was the “official website for the Fresh Milk Products Price-Fixing Class Action Lawsuit,” and a hub for filing claims and obtaining more information. According to that site, settlement eligibility applies only to consumers in 15 states and the District of Columbia:
I was a resident of at least one of these states during at least part of 2003 to the present: Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, or Wisconsin.
A question-and-answer section additionally explained that eligible class members living in those states must have purchased milk products since 2003:
Individuals and entities who, as residents of Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, or Wisconsin, during the period of 2003 to the present, purchased milk or other fresh milk products (including cream, half & half, yogurt, cottage cheese, cream cheese, or sour cream) for their own use and not for resale. Governmental entities are excluded from the class.
To be a class member, you must not have purchased the milk or other fresh milk products directly from a defendant. Instead, you must have purchased the milk indirectly, for example, through a grocery store or other retailer.
According to BoughtMilk.com, eligible individuals could receive between $45 to $70 from a settlement pool of $52 million. The claim period began on 2 September 2016, and the final deadline for filing passed on 31 January 2017.

You or your company may have directly purchased Li-Ion Cells, Li-Ion Batteries and/or Li-Ion Products from January 1, 2000 through May 31, 2011. For purposes of these Settlements, a direct purchaser is a person or business who bought a Li-Ion Battery and/or Li-Ion Product directly from one or more of the Defendants, or any division, subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, or any alleged co-conspirator (as opposed to an intermediary, such as a retail store) in the United States.
You have the right to know about the litigation and about your legal rights and options before the Court decides whether to approve the Settlements.
The Notice explains the litigation, the Settlements, and your legal rights. 
The Court in charge of the case is the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and the case is called In re: Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 13-MD-02420-YGR. The people who sued are called "Plaintiffs", and the companies they sued are called "Defendants".
Back To Top

Who are the Defendant Companies?
The Defendant companies include the following LG Chem, Ltd.; LG Chem America, Inc.; Samsung SDI Co. Ltd.; Samsung SDI America, Inc.; Panasonic Corporation; Panasonic Corporation of North America; Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd.; Sanyo North America Corporation; Sony Corporation; Sony Energy Devices Corporation; Sony Electronics Inc.; Hitachi Maxell, Ltd.; Maxell Corporation of America; NEC Corporation; NEC Tokin Corporation; and Toshiba Corporation.
Back To Top

What is this lawsuit about?
The lawsuit alleges that Defendants and co-conspirators conspired to raise and fix the prices of Li-Ion Cells for over ten years, resulting in overcharges to direct purchasers of Li-Ion Batteries and Li-Ion Products. The Complaint describes how the Defendants and co-conspirators allegedly violated the U.S. antitrust laws by agreeing to fix prices and restrict output of Li-Ion Cells by, among other things, face-to-face meetings and other communications, customer allocation, and the use of trade associations. Defendants deny Plaintiffs’ allegations. The Court has not decided who is right.
Back To Top

Why are there Settlements, although the litigation is continuing?
 Plaintiffs have reached Settlements with Defendants Maxell, NEC, Toshiba and Panasonic. The Panasonic Settlement also resolves claims against SANYO. The Court has already approved a settlement with another group of Defendants—Sony Corporation, Sony Energy Devices Corporation and Sony Electronics Inc. (collectively, “Sony”). The case is continuing against the remaining non-released Defendants. Additional money may become available in the future as a result of a trial or future settlements, but there is no guarantee that this will happen.
Back To Top

What are Li-Ion Cells, Li-Ion Batteries, and Li-Ion Products?
For the purposes of the Settlements: 

“Lithium Ion Battery Cell(s)” or “Li-Ion Cells” means the main components of Lithium Ion Batteries. A cell includes the cathode, anode, and electrolyte.
“Lithium Ion Battery” or “Li-Ion Battery” means a cylindrical, prismatic or polymer battery that is rechargeable and uses lithium ion technology. 
“Lithium Ion Battery Products” or “Li-Ion Products” means products manufactured, marketed and/or sold by Defendants, their divisions, subsidiaries or Affiliates, or their alleged co-conspirators that contain one or more Lithium Ion Battery Cells manufactured by Defendants or their alleged co-conspirators. Lithium Ion Battery Products include, but are not limited to, notebook computers, cellular (mobile) phones, digital cameras, camcorders and power tools.

Back To Top

What is a Class Action?
In a class action, one or more people, called “class representatives,” sue on behalf of people who have similar claims. All these people are members of the class, except for those who exclude themselves from the class.
Back To Top

How do I know if I’m part of the Settlement Classes?
The Maxell, NEC and Toshiba Settlement Classes includes persons and entities who, from January 1, 2000 through May 31, 2011, bought a Li-Ion Cell, Li-Ion Battery and/or Li-Ion Product directly from one or more of the Defendants, or any division, subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, or any alleged co-conspirator (as opposed to an intermediary, such as a retail store) in the United States. The Panasonic Settlement Class includes persons and entities who made such purchases from May 1, 2002 through May 31, 2011.
Back To Top

What do the Settlements provide?
The Settlements provide for payments totaling $49,850,000.00 in cash, plus interest, as follows: Maxell--$3.45 million; NEC--$1 million; Panasonic--$42.5 million; Toshiba--$2.9 million. The Settlements also provide for continuing cooperation, including the production of witnesses. In addition, Settling Defendants’ sales remain in the case for the purpose of computing damages against the remaining Defendants. 
Back To Top

When can I get a payment?
No money will be distributed to any members of the Settlement Classes yet. The lawyers will pursue the lawsuit against the remaining Defendants to see if any future settlements or judgments can be obtained in the case and then be distributed together, to reduce expenses.
You will be notified in the future when and where to send a claim form. DO NOT SEND ANY CLAIMS NOW.
In the future, the Settlement Funds will be allocated on a pro rata basis based on the dollar value of each Class Member’s purchase(s) of Li-Ion Cells, Li-Ion Batteries and/or Li-Ion Products in proportion to the total claims filed. For purposes of determining the pro rata allocation of Settlement Funds, purchases of Li-Ion Batteries and/or Li-Ion Products will be valued according to the proportionate value of the Li-Ion Cells contained in the product. The resulting amounts will be multiplied by the Net Settlement Fund (total settlements minus all costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses) to determine each claimant’s pro rata share of the Settlement Fund.
Back To Top

What are my rights in the Settlement Classes?

Remain in the Settlement Class: If you wish to remain a member of the Settlement Classes, you do not need to take any action at this time.
Get out of the Settlement Class: If you wish to keep any of your rights to sue Maxell, NEC, Panasonic, SANYO and/or Toshiba about claims concerning the manufacture, supply, distribution, sale or pricing of Li-Ion Cells, other than indirect purchase claims, or claims for product liability, personal injury or breach of contract claims not related to the allegations in this case, you must exclude yourself from the Settlement Classes relating to the Defendant(s) you wish to retain your rights to sue. You will not get any money from the Settlements from which you exclude yourself.
To exclude yourself from one or more of the Settlement Classes, you must send a letter that includes the following:

Your name, address and telephone number (include trade or business names, address and telephone numbers);
A statement saying that you want to be excluded from In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 13-MD-02420-YGR, Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Settlements with Maxell, NEC, Panasonic and/or Toshiba; and
Your signature.

You must mail your exclusion request, postmarked no later than June 26, 2017, to:
In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litigation
Settlement Administrator
P.O. Box 4098
Portland, OR 97208-4098


Remain in the Settlement Class and Object: You can ask the Court to deny approval of one or more of the Settlements by filing an objection. You can’t ask the Court to order larger settlements; the Court can only approve or deny the Settlements. If the Court denies approval, no settlement payments will be sent out, and the lawsuit will continue. If that is what you want to happen, you must object.
You may object to the proposed Settlement in writing. You may also appear at the Fairness Hearing, either in person or through your own attorney. If you appear through your own attorney, you are responsible for paying that attorney. All written objections and supporting papers must (a) clearly identify the case name and number (In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 13-MD-02420-YGR); (b) be submitted to the Court either by mailing them to the Class Action Clerk, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, 1301 Clay Street, Oakland, CA 94612, or by filing them in person at any location of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California; and (c) be filed or postmarked on or before June 26, 2017.

Back To Top

What am I giving up to stay in the Settlement Classes?
Unless you exclude yourself from the Settlement Class(es), you can’t sue Maxell, NEC, Panasonic, SANYO or Toshiba, or be part of any other lawsuit against Maxell, NEC, Panasonic, SANYO or Toshiba, about the legal issues in this case. It also means that all of the decisions by the Court will bind you. The “Release of Claims” includes any causes of actions asserted or that could have been asserted in the lawsuit, as described more fully in the Settlement Agreements.
Back To Top

When and where will the Court decide whether to approve the Settlements?

At this hearing, the Court will consider whether the Settlements are fair, reasonable and adequate. If there are objections, the Court will consider them at that time. After the hearing, the Court will decide whether to approve the Settlements. We do not know how long these decisions will take.
Back To Top

Do I have to attend the Hearing?
No. Class Counsel will answer any questions the Court may have. But, you are welcome to come at your own expense. If you file or mail an objection, you don’t have to come to Court to talk about it.. As long as you filed or mailed your written objection on time, the Court will consider it. You may also pay another lawyer to attend, but it’s not required.
Back To Top

Do I have a lawyer in the case?
Yes. The Court has appointed the law firms of Saveri & Saveri, Inc.; Pearson, Simon & Warshaw, LLP; and Berman DeValerio to represent you as “Class Counsel.” You do not have to pay Class Counsel.

The New Hampshire Trust Advantage











As a part of its comprehensive wealth management services, Cambridge Trust works with clients who wish to take advantage of New Hampshire's robust trust laws and favorable tax climate. The benefits of New Hampshire’s laws are available to both residents and non-residents of New Hampshire.
New Hampshire is one of the leading states in which to administer and manage trusts. New Hampshire's laws enable a settlor (that is, the person who creates a trust) great flexibility in creating a trust that suits his or her particular goals and wishes. In addition, those laws often make New Hampshire an attractive state to move an existing trust. Some of the key aspects of New Hampshire's trust laws include:

Directed Trusts. New Hampshire law allows for investment and administrative responsibilities to be divided among trustees and third parties. For example, in a directed trust, an investment manager can have the exclusive duty to invest the trust’s assets while the trustee is only responsible for the other aspects of administering the trust.
Dynasty Trusts. New Hampshire law allows an individual to create a perpetual trust. Thus, an individual may create a multi-generational trust or a trust for a particular purpose and the trust need not terminate within some artificial time frame.
Wealth Preservation Trusts. New Hampshire law allows for the creation of wealth preservation trusts (also called asset protection trusts), which provide significant protections for trust assets against a settlor’s or beneficiary’s creditors.
Trust Protectors and Trust Advisors. New Hampshire law recognizes trust protectors and trust advisors who can oversee or advise the trustees or investment managers.
Decanting. New Hampshire law allows decanting, a process by which a trustee creates a new trust and transfers assets from the old trust to the new trust. Most typically, a trustee would exercise the power to decant for purposes of improving the administrative provisions governing the trust. For example, by today's standards, some older trusts have inflexible, restrictive, or ambiguous provisions governing investments, distributions, or trustee succession, which can make decanting an attractive option.
Efficient Administration. New Hampshire's laws facilitate the efficient administration of trusts. Through concepts like virtual representation (which allows certain beneficiaries to represent the interest of other beneficiaries), and non-judicial settlement agreements, trustees often can resolve administrative issues—such as the interpretation of ambiguous trust provisions or confirming the scope or propriety of the trustee's actions—without having to seek court involvement.
State Tax Advantages. New Hampshire does not impose any capital gains or other income tax on irrevocable trusts.

Cambridge Trust Company of New Hampshire, Inc., a New Hampshire non-depository trust company, can help you and your advisors determine whether a New Hampshire trust is right for you. Download our fact sheet for more information.

(collectively “PLDS”); (ii) Pioneer Corporation, Pioneer North America, Inc., Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc., and Pioneer High Fidelity Taiwan Co., Ltd. (collectively “Pioneer”); (iii) TEAC America, Inc.; TEAC Corporation (collectively “TEAC”) in antitrust class action lawsuits pending before Judge Richard Seeborg in federal court.The Court has ordered notice of settlements with these defendants to the class. The settlements would resolve the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs’ claims against these defendants. The litigation will continue against the remaining defendants.
This Notice is to inform you of the certification of the Class, the settlements and your rights in the litigation. This Notice is not an expression by the Court of any opinion as to the merits of any of the claims or defenses asserted by either side in this lawsuit.
Read on for more information on your options, including how to claim your cash payment.
Who is included in the settlements?
Individuals and businesses who, as residents of Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, or Wisconsin that, during the period of April 2003 to December 2008, purchased a new computer with an internal ODD, a stand-alone ODD designed for internal use in a computer, or an ODD designed to be attached externally to a computer for their own use and not for resale. ODD refers to a DVD-RW, DVD-ROM, or COMBO drive manufactured by one or more Defendants or their asserted conspirators. Purchases made directly from an ODD manufacturer and the purchases of Panasonic-branded computers are not included. A list of manufacturers may be found at www.OpticalDiskDriveAntitrust.com or by calling 1-877-368-9020.
What do the settlements provide?
The settlements provide for $55.5 million in recovery for the class. Specifically:

The PLDS settlement provides for a $40 million settlement fund.
The Pioneer settlement provides for a $10.5 million settlement fund.
The TEAC settlement provides for a $5 million settlement fund.

These settlements are in addition to $124.5 million already reached with four defendant families (Panasonic, NEC, Sony and HLDS) which have received final approval by the court. Class members are still able to make claims on the original $124.5 million in settlements.
You can submit a simple online claim form with no proof of purchase required. If final approval is granted to the settlement, Class members who have filed valid and timely claims will receive cash payments distributed electronically. If you are a Class Member with valid and timely claims and would prefer to receive a physical check, please submit a written request by August 1, 2017 to In re ODD Products Indirect Purchaser Litigation, P.O. Box 43424, Providence, RI 02940-3424. IPPs propose to compensate members of the state classes according to a plan of distribution which provides for a pro rata share of the settlement fund based on: (1) the number of ODDs purchased by the class member; and (2) the number of valid claims filed. Any remaining funds may be distributed in a second round to class members, or, depending on the funds remaining, be distributed to the California Attorney General for use in prosecuting consumer and antitrust claims. Under no circumstances will the money go back to the defendants.
Who are released?
The settlements release Koninklijke Philips N.V., Lite-On IT Corporation, Philips & Lite-On Digital Solutions Corporation, Philips & Lite-On Digital Solutions U.S.A., Inc., Pioneer Corporation, Pioneer North America, Inc., Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc., Pioneer High Fidelity Taiwan Co., Ltd., Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Company, TEAC America, Inc., and TEAC Corporation from claims made in this litigation.

BASIC INFORMATION


What are these lawsuits about?
This antitrust class action lawsuit was filed by plaintiffs alleging a conspiracy involving ODD suppliers to fix, maintain, or stabilize the prices of ODDs at artificially high levels in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. ODD refers to a DVD-RW, DVD-ROM, or COMBO drive manufactured by one or more Defendants or their asserted conspirators. The cases are known as In re Optical Disk Drive Products Antitrust Litigation, No. 3:10-MD-2143-RS (MDL 2143). This lawsuit is brought on behalf of individuals and businesses who purchased a new computer with an internal ODD, a stand-alone ODD designed for internal use in a computer, or an ODD designed to be attached externally to a computer as residents of Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, or Wisconsin between April 1, 2003 and December 31, 2008 for their own use and not for resale. Because the class here is end-users who did not resell their products, they are known as “indirect purchasers.” The defendants deny they did anything wrong.
 


Who brought these lawsuits?
A group of twenty-three class representatives sued on behalf of people who have similar claims. The class representatives are: Mike Bishop, Cindy Booze, Wanda Duryea, Matthew Ence, Benjamin Faber, Barney Gooman, Jr., Matthew Hosking, James Ito-Adler, Chris Johnson, Susie Lim, John McKee, Gail Murphy, Benjamin Murray, Angela Pritchard, Ben Porter, Mike Reilly, Sandra Steffen, Thomas Stenger, Kristina Tecce, Brian Tindall, Anbessa Tufa, and Kimberly Wood. In its order certifying the class, the District Court found that each of these representatives adequately represent the interests of class members. These class representatives have individually devoted significant amounts of time to this litigation, including reviewing pleadings and legal briefs filed in the action, responding to discovery requests from the defendants and being deposed by the defendants. Each of the class representatives supports the proposed settlements.
 


Who are the settling defendants?  

Plaintiffs have settled with three separate groups of defendants, which include the following companies: Koninklijke Philips N.V., Lite-On IT Corporation, Philips & Lite-On Digital Solutions Corporation, Philips & Lite-On Digital Solutions U.S.A., Inc. (collectively “PLDS”);
Pioneer Corporation, Pioneer North America, Inc., Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc., and Pioneer High Fidelity Taiwan Co., Ltd. (collectively “Pioneer”);
TEAC America, Inc.; TEAC Corporation (collectively “TEAC”).

 


Who are the remaining defendants?
A number of the defendants remain in this case, and the class has been certified to proceed against the remaining defendants. The remaining defendants include: BenQ Corporation, BenQ America Corp., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Toshiba Corp., Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology Corp., Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology Corp. Korea, and Quanta Storage Inc. The settlements with the PLDS, Pioneer and TEAC defendants do not release claims against these remaining defendants. The District Court has set a trial date of February 12, 2018, for the trial of the indirect purchaser plaintiffs against these remaining defendants.
 

 WHO IS INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENTS AND CERTIFIED CLASS?


How do I know if I am part of the settlements and certified class?
You are included in the settlements and certified class if:

You purchased a new computer with an internal ODD, a stand-alone ODD designed for internal use in a computer, or an ODD designed to be attached externally to a computer for your own use and not for resale;
You made this purchase while a resident of Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, or Wisconsin; and
You made this purchase between April 1, 2003 and December 31, 2008.

Panasonic-branded computers are excluded from the class. ODDs purchased directly from a defendant are also excluded from the class. You do not need to have a proof-of-purchase or retain the item to participate in the settlements.
 

THE SETTLEMENTS’ BENEFITS


What do the settlements provide?
The settlements provide for $55.5 million in recovery for class members. Specifically:

The PLDS settlement provides for a $40 million settlement fund.
The Pioneer settlement provides for a $10.5 million settlement fund.
The TEAC settlement provides for a $5 million settlement fund.

These settlements are in addition to $124.5 million already reached with four defendant families (Panasonic, NEC, Sony and HLDS) which have received final approval by the court. Class members are still able to make claims on the original $124.5 million in settlements. If final approval is granted to one, some or all of the settlements, class members who have filed valid and timely claims will receive an electronic payment.
 


How much will my payment be?
IPPs propose to compensate members of the state classes according to a plan of distribution which provides for a pro rata share of the settlement fund based on: (1) the number of ODDs purchased by the class member; and (2) the number of valid claims filed. The current estimated settlement amount is approximately $10/drive, which could increase or decrease.
 


What do I have to do to get my payment?
File a claim online or by mail by August 1, 2017. The simple online claim form only takes 3-5 minutes for most individuals. Claims may be submitted by mail to In re ODD Products Indirect Purchaser Litigation, P.O. Box 43424, Providence, RI 02940-3424. We highly recommend that you submit the claim online to receive expedited service on August 1, 2017 or soon thereafter. After August 1, 2017, an email will be sent to your account on file with instructions on how to electronically receive your payment via PayPal, Google Wallet, Amazon Balance, and others. Additionally, if you previously filed a claim on the initial settlements with Panasonic, NEC, Sony and HLDS, you do not need to file a new claim now and your previously filed claim will automatically be counted toward the new settlements with PLDS, Pioneer and TEAC, as well as any future settlements that may be reached with any of the remaining defendants in the case, unless you specifically exclude yourself from one or more of those new settlements. If you have yet to file a claim and you do so now, that claim will also be counted toward all of the settlements reached to date, as well as any future settlements that may be reached with the remaining defendants in the case, unless you specifically exclude yourself from any of those settlements. Plaintiffs have also collected direct contact information for class members and anticipate making reasonable attempts to distribute monies to class members where an address is available. This method is not guaranteed, however, and to ensure payment class members should submit a claims form.
 


How do I exclude myself from the settlements?
You can choose to exclude yourself from the PLDS, Pioneer, and TEAC Settlements and keep your right to sue the defendants on your own. If you exclude yourself, you cannot receive any benefits from the settlements. Your written Exclusion Form must set forth your name and a statement that you request exclusion from the class and do not wish to participate in the settlement. You must exclude yourself from each settlement individually (note that you request exclusion from all settlements or one settlement in particular). All requests for exclusion must be postmarked by July 14, 2017 and sent to In re ODD Products Indirect Purchaser Litigation, PO Box 43424, Providence, RI 02940-3424.
 


How do I exclude myself from this litigation?
You can choose to exclude yourself from this litigation altogether and keep your right to sue the defendants on your own. If you exclude yourself, you cannot receive any benefits from this litigation going forward. Your written Exclusion Form must set forth your name and a statement that you request exclusion from the litigation entirely. All requests for exclusion must be postmarked by July 14, 2017 and sent to In re ODD Products Indirect Purchaser Litigation, PO Box 43424, Providence, RI 02940-3424.
 


If I exclude myself, can I still get benefits from the settlements and the litigation?
No. If you exclude yourself from the settlements and the litigation, you will not receive any benefits.
 


If I exclude myself, can I sue the defendants separately?
If you exclude yourself from the settlements and/or the litigation, you may be able to sue the defendants about the issues related to this case. If you do not exclude yourself, you give up your right to sue the defendants about the issues related to this case.
 

OBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT


How do I object?
You can ask the Court to deny approval by filing an objection. Please note that you cannot ask the Court to order a larger settlement; the Court can only approve or deny the settlement. If the Court denies approval, no settlement payments will be sent out and the lawsuit will continue. If that is what you want to happen, you must object. Objections must be in writing and postmarked on or before July 14, 2017. All written objections and supporting papers must (a) clearly identify the case name and number (In Re Optical Disk Drive Products Antitrust Litigation, Indirect Purchaser Action, Case No. 3:10-MD-2143), (b) be submitted to the Court either by mailing them to the Class Action Clerk, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, 450 Golden Gate Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102, or by filing them in person at any location of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and (c) be filed or postmarked on or before July 14, 2017.
 


What is the difference between objecting and excluding myself?
Objecting is simply telling the Court that you do not like something about the settlements. You can object to the settlements only if you do not exclude yourself. Excluding yourself from the settlements is telling the Court that you do not want to be part of the settlements. If you exclude yourself from the settlements, you have no basis to object to the settlements because they no longer affect you.
 


When and where will the Court decide whether to approve the settlements?
The Court will hold a Final Approval Hearing on September 7, 2017, at 1:30 p.m. at the United States District Court, 450 Golden Gate Ave, San Francisco, CA, Courtroom 3 – 17th Floor, to consider whether to approve or deny the PLDS, Pioneer, and TEAC Settlements and a request for attorneys’ fees up to 25 percent of the Settlement Funds. You may appear at the Final Approval Hearing either in person or through your own attorney. The Hearing may be moved to a different date or time without additional notice, so please check www.OpticalDiskDriveAntitrust.com for any updates and additional information.
 


Do I have to come to the hearing?
No. The Court appointed Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP to represent the Settlement Class.
 


May I speak at the hearing?
Yes. You may appear at the hearing, or you may hire your own attorney, if you wish, at your own expense.
 


What happens if I do nothing at all?
If the Court gives final approval to the settlements, you might not receive your payment automatically. You should make a claim either by mail or online to ensure payment from these settlements.
 


How Do I Get More Information?
This website summarizes the proposed settlements. More details are in the settlement agreements, available here. Many of the important documents in the case are also available here, including the operative complaint, the District Court’s order certifying the class. Plaintiffs will add additional case documents to this website as the litigation proceeds. You may also contact class counsel at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro (odd@hbsslaw.com), or access the Court’s docket in this case through the Court’s Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system at https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov, or by visiting the office of the Clerk of the Court for the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, 450 Golden Gate Ave., San Francisco, CA 94102, between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding Court holidays. For questions about the settlement or the claims process, you may contact the Settlement Administrator at 877-368-9020. PLEASE DO NOT TELEPHONE THE COURT OR THE COURT CLERK’S OFFICE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THIS SETTLEMENT OR THE CLAIM PROCESS.
 


What happens to any funds remaining after distribution to the class?
Plaintiffs will make their best efforts to distribute funds received through the settlements to the class. Any remaining funds may be distributed in a second round to class members, or, depending on the funds remaining, be distributed to the California Attorney General for use in prosecuting consumer and antitrust claims. Under no circumstances will the money go back to the defendants.
 


Why is my state not included?
If your state is not listed, it may be because it does not provide standing for indirect purchasers of price-fixed goods, or has a state law that differs materially from the federal antitrust laws, whereby the Court declined to include residents of that state in the class.
 


How do I update my submission (email, name, or ODD quantity)?
There is a two-step process to updating your claim. First, please visit the claim removal page and delete your existing claim. You will need the email address and Claim Identification Number from your original request.  Once your claim is removed, you are able to make a new online claim with the updated information.
 


There is an issue with the claim form, how do I fix it?
Some OS/Browser combinations may not be supported. Please try to submit a claim on a different OS/Browser combination. If no combinations work, please describe the issue via our support page and we will address this matter promptly.
