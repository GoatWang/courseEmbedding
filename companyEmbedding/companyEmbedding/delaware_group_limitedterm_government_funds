Letter                                     Delaware Limited-Term Government Fund
TO SHAREHOLDERS                        January 10, 2003                 

Recap of Events                                                                 
The largest story of 2002 was the status of the economic recovery. According to 
government statistics, the most recent recession spanned the first three        
quarters of 2001. By the fourth quarter of that year, growth took hold and the  
question on investors' minds turned to the pace of the recovery.                

Over the last 12 months, the Commerce Department reported uninterrupted         
expansion of the economy. Yet that revival, as measured by gross domestic       
product (GDP), has been erratic. In the first quarter of 2002, GDP growth was a 
robust, inflation-adjusted +5.0%. By the final quarter of 2002, GDP grew a      
meager +0.7%.                                                                   

While the economic recovery moved forward with an uneven pace throughout the    
12-month period ended December 31, 2002, bond investors enjoyed a rather robust 
period in the fixed-income market. The driving force of the fixed-income market 
was the steady decline in interest rates. Prompted by a low inflation outlook,  
rates also moved lower due to the actions of the Federal Reserve and its        
monetary strategy of adding liquidity to maintain economic growth. In early     
November, the Fed lowered rates one half percent, just in time to give the      
economy an added measure of stimuli going into the holiday shopping season. Yet 
another positive for the bond market came with investors seeking bonds with the 
lowest levels of credit risk, hence the interest in securities issued by the    
U.S. government and its affiliated agencies. This "flight to quality" was       
largely based on geopolitical concerns, reaction to acts of corporate           
malfeasance, and a weak stock market.                                           

In fact, stocks underperformed bonds for a third straight year, the first time  
that event has occurred in over twenty years. Few areas of the stock market     
could avoid the selling pressures. For the period of this report, the Standard &
Poor's 500 Stock index fell roughly -22% and the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite    
Index declined approximately -31%. Despite a brief rally in late July, and      
another upsurge to span October and November, the selling pressure in stocks had
the greatest impact on performance and was caused largely by investor           
uncertainty regarding the pace of the recovery.                                 

Investors have vacillated in their opinion about the course of the economy.     
Ongoing concern has been focused on the lack of business spending throughout the
economic recovery. Also known as capital expenditure, corporations spent at an  
historically high level in the 1990s, leading to excess capacity. With the      
ensuing mismatch between production and demand, businesses substantially scaled 
back on their spending with the new decade. We believe this retrenchment helped 
spark the recession of 2001, as well as inhibited the economic ability to bounce
back, as with many prior post-recessionary environments, has contributing to the
less-than-expected rate of growth and inhibiting companies to ramp up new       
employee hiring.                                                                

Conversely, investors have been faced with many positives about the economy.    
Productivity, long-held in economic theory as the basis that determines a       
country's standard of living, continued to show strength. Recent data revealed  
that productivity is running at roughly five percent. Investors                 

Total Return

witnessed mounting signs that the stimulus-oriented strategies of the Federal   
Reserve, as with their 11 interest rate cuts of 2001, were appearing to take    
hold. Lower rates, for instance, prompted a wave of mortgage refinancing that   
totaled $1 billion in 2001 and 2002, freeing up added cash for families across  
the nation (Source: The Wall Street Journal). Lastly, investors monitored news  
reports in early January of the Bush administration's proposed massive spending 
and tax-cut package, designed to pump some $670 billion into the economy over   
the next decade. Though this measure must go before Congress, it nonetheless    
supports the supposition that growth is not only in place, but has the backing  
of very significant macroeconomic forces.                                       

Market Outlook                                                                  
We are guardedly optimistic about the status of the economic environment and    
financial markets as the new year moves along. We believe that inflation will   
remain largely in check and that the economy will continue to expand in 2003.   
Ongoing growth should likely bring with it higher interest rates. Likewise,     
Washington's stimulus policy could increase the supply of Treasuries, adding    
further pressure on rates.                                                      

We remind investors that rising rates contribute to the declining market prices 
of fixed-income securities, with shorter-term bonds offering the least decrease 
in value. For investors with a longer-term perspective, the benefit of such an  
environment is that the income stream from their bond funds may likely          
experience a modest increase. We also point out that bonds have consistently    
served to dampen volatility within diversified investor portfolios.             

Of course, diplomatic affairs between the U.S. and Iraq have taken center stage 
over the past several weeks. As no one knows precisely how this delicate matter 
will be played out in the coming weeks or months, we feel it may be best to take
advantage of the wait-and-see environment that has evolved of late for investors
to meet with their financial professionals. In doing so, longer-term investment 
goals can be updated, and the type and composition of funds to achieve those    
objectives may be properly evaluated.                                           

Thank you for your continued confidence in and commitment to Delaware           
Investments.

Portfolio                                  Delaware Limited-Term Government Fund
MANAGEMENT REVIEW                       January 10, 2003                  

Fund Managers                                                                   
Paul Grillo, Jr.                                                                
Senior Portfolio Manager                                                        

Stephen R. Cianci                                                               
Senior Portfolio Manager                                                        

The Fund's Results                                                              
Your Fund is managed with the attempt to generate a high level of income while  
reducing the effects of interest-rate changes. We do this by limiting duration  
strategy and keeping the average bond maturity below five years. As part of our 
program of risk controls, we closely monitor and strictly control risk factors  
attributed to prepayment and credit concerns. We also employ proprietary models 
to track relative performance versus our peer group.                            

In selecting securities for your Fund, we analyze macroeconomic factors to      
discover inefficiencies in the fixed-income market and identify the securities  
that we believe offer the best reward opportunities for the Fund. We believe our
combination of a quantitative screening process and stringent, qualitative,     
analysis provides us a robust management style with which to address the        
ever-changing environment of fixed-income investing.                            

For the 12-month period covered in this report, your Fund gained +7.08% (Class A
shares at net asset value with distributions reinvested). The Merrill Lynch 1-3 
Year Treasury Index, which serves as the Fund's benchmark, rose +5.76%. The     
Lipper Short-Intermediate Government Funds Average, which serves as the Fund's  
peer group, returned +7.84% for the period.                                     

Portfolio Highlights                                                            
Our general management style for your Fund has been to maintain a high premium  
on safety. The 12-month period just ended will long be remembered for four      
primary themes: declining interest rates, a low inflationary environment, acts  
of corporate irresponsibility, and geopolitical risks. The first two favored    
bond funds in general and your Fund in particular as we were able to function in
the very attractive short-to-intermediate sector of the government bond market. 
While the latter two themes added to investor concerns for the financial        
markets, the demand for highly-rated government securities allowed us to be     
somewhat defensive in managing the Fund.                                        

Accordingly, we began the fiscal year with just such a conservative posture,    
keeping down the maturity and duration (a measure of bond price sensitivity to  
changes in interest rates) of the bonds within the portfolio. The move proved   
advantageous as rates moved slightly upwards from February to March.            

Once the downward trend in interest rates reestablished itself, we chose to     
neutralize the Fund's duration relative to our benchmark index and peer funds.  
The decision to neutralize was a prudent one. Interest rates in this environment
dropped significantly, as with the 5-year Treasury bond yield, which declined   
approximately one half percentage point. From our action, we were able to       
produce returns competitive with our benchmark.                                 

As the Fund's fiscal year moved into its final quarter, we elected to return to 
a somewhat shorter maturity versus our peers. We believed prolonged expansion of
the economy could likely bring with it a generally upward bias in interest      
rates. Rates in fact did move slightly upwards from September until November.   
Such an upmove in rates can cause modest declines in bond values, and our       
decision to rein in portfolio maturity and duration was intended to help        
mitigate any price movements while ensuring a competitive flow of current       
income.                                                                         

For the fiscal year, we did not alter the aggregate credit quality of the       
portfolio. We did increase the Fund's exposure to Treasury securities given     
their attractive risk/return profiles. We increased our weighting in high       
quality government-oriented agency bonds. Where we reduced bond exposure was in 
premium mortgage-backed securities.

Outlook                                                                         
With a new year ahead of us, we believe that the expansion-oriented monetary and
fiscal stimulus programs that date to 2001 are beginning to be felt within the  
economy. Such powerful catalysts for growth should enable the economic expansion
to continue into 2003. The offset to the Federal Reserve's policies is that     
interest rates may eventually need to be moved higher, perhaps by one half      
percent.                                                                        

A move of this nature would not only redirect the Fed's policy on interest rates
since the recent recession, but would impact bonds by moving prices slightly    
lower. This process would tend to be felt most in longer-term bonds, since their
income payments move further out into the future, and thus are more susceptible 
to an erosion in purchasing power caused by rising inflation. Conversely,       
shorter-term bonds, such as those found within your portfolio, would tend to be 
less impacted by rising rates.                                                  

As no investor possesses a crystal ball as to the detailed future actions of    
interest rates or the financial markets, we believe it may be best for investors
to seek a broadly diversified portfolio. We also believe the Delaware           
Limited-Term Government Fund can have a meaningful place in such a portfolio,   
given its ability to generate a steady stream of income while offering a        
fixed-income exposure with limited fluctuations to investor capital.

Returns reflect the reinvestment of all distributions and any applicable sales  
charges as noted below. Returns and share values will fluctuate so that shares, 
when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance  
for Class B and C shares, excluding sales charges, assumes either that          
contingent deferred sales charges did not apply or the investment was not       
redeemed. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.                

The Fund offers Class A, B, C, and Institutional shares. Class A shares are sold
with a front-end sales charge of up to 2.75% and have an annual distribution and
service fee of up to 0.30%.                                                     

Class B shares are sold with a contingent deferred sales charge that declines   
from 2% to zero depending upon the period of time the shares are held. Class B  
shares will automatically convert to Class A shares on a quarterly basis        
approximately five years after purchase. They are also subject to an annual     
distribution and service fee of up to 1%.                                       

Class C shares are sold with a contingent deferred sales charge of 1% if        
redeemed during the first 12 months. They are also subject to an annual         
distribution and service fee of up to 1%.                                       

The average annual total returns for the lifetime (since 11/24/85), 10-year,    
five-year, and one-year periods ended December 31, 2002 for Delaware            
Limited-Term Government Fund's Institutional Class were +6.62%, +5.45%, +6.60%, 
and +7.27%, respectively. The Institutional Class shares were first made        
available on June 1, 1992 and are available without sales or asset-based        
distribution charges only to certain eligible institutional accounts.           
Institutional Class performance prior to June 1, 1992 for Delaware Limited-Term 
Government Fund Institutional Class is based on Class A performance and was     
adjusted to eliminate the sales charges, but not the asset-based distribution   
charge of Class A shares.                                                       

The performance table and chart do not reflect the deduction of taxes the       
shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or redemptions of Fund shares.      

An expense limitation was in effect for all classes of Delaware Limited-Term    
Government Fund for the periods shown. Performance would have been lower had the
expense limitation not been in effect.

Performance of other Fund classes will vary due to different charges and        
expenses. Returns plotted on the chart were as of the last day of each month    
shown. The Merrill Lynch 1-3 Year Treasury Index is an unmanaged composite that 
generally tracks the market for U.S. Treasury securities with maturities of one 
to three years. An index is unmanaged and does not reflect the costs of         
operating a mutual fund, such as the costs of buying, selling, and holding      
securities. You cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance is not a   
guarantee of future results.

(1) Total investment return is based on the change in net asset value of a      
share during the period and assumes reinvestment of dividend and        
   distributions at net asset value and does not reflect the impact of a sales
charge. Total investment return reflects a waiver and payment of fees by
the manager, as applicable. Performance would have been lower had the   
expense limitation not been in effect.                                  

(2) As required, effective January 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of  
  the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities and the   
recording of paydown gains and losses on mortgage- and asset-backed     
   securities as an adjustment to interest income. The effect of these changes
for the year ended December 31, 2001 was a decrease in net investment   
   income per share of $0.068, an increase in net realized and unrealized gain
 (loss) per share of $0.068, and a decrease in the ratio of net investment
income to average net assets of 0.80%. Per share data and ratios for    
periods prior to January 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect these
changes in accounting.

charge. Total investment return reflects a waiver and payment of fees by
the manager, as applicable. Performance would have been lower had the   
expense limitation not been in effect.                                  

(2) As required, effective January 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of

amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities and the   
recording of paydown gains and losses on mortgage- and asset-backed     
   securities as an adjustment to interest income. The effect of these changes
for the year ended December 31, 2001 was a decrease in net investment

Notes                                      Delaware Limited-Term Government Fund
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                 December 31, 2002                 

Delaware Group Limited-Term Government Funds (the "Trust") is organized as a    
Delaware business trust and offers one fund: Delaware Limited-Term Government   
Fund (the "Fund"). The Trust is an open-end investment company. The Fund is     
considered diversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and
offers Class A, Class B, Class C and Institutional Class shares. Class A shares 
are sold with a front-end sales charge of up to 2.75%. Class B shares are sold  
with a contingent deferred sales charge that declines from 2% to zero depending 
upon the period of time the shares are held. Class B shares will automatically  
convert to Class A shares on a quarterly basis approximately five years after   
purchase. Class C shares are sold with a contingent deferred sales charge of 1%,
if redeemed, during the first 12 months. Institutional shares are not subject to
a sales charge and are offered for sale exclusively to a limited group of       
investors.                                                                      

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek a high stable level of current  
income, while attempting to minimize fluctuations in principal and provide      
maximum liquidity.                                                              

1. Significant Accounting Policies                                              
The following accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles  
generally accepted in the United States and are consistently followed by the    
Fund.                                                                           

Security Valuation -- Long-term debt securities are valued by an independent    
pricing service and such prices are believed to reflect the fair value of such  
securities. Short-term debt securities having less than 60 days to maturity are 
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Other securities and 
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair 
value as determined in good faith under the direction of the Fund's Board of    
Trustees.                                                                       

Federal Income Taxes -- The Fund intends to continue to qualify for federal tax 
purposes as a regulated investment company and make the requisite distributions 
to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been    
made in the financial statements. Class Accounting -- Investment income, common 
expenses are allocated to the various classes of the Fund on the basis of       
"settled shares" of each class in relation to the net assets of the Fund.       
Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments are allocated to the various 
classes of the Fund on the basis of daily net assets of each class. Distribution
expenses relating to a specific class are charged directly to that class.       
Repurchase Agreements -- The Fund may invest in a pooled cash account along with
other members of the Delaware Investments Family of Funds. The aggregate daily  
balance of the pooled cash account is invested in repurchase agreements secured 
by obligations of the U.S. government. The respective collateral is held by the 
Fund's custodian bank until the maturity of the respective repurchase           
agreements. Each repurchase agreement is 102% collateralized. However, in the   
event of default or bankruptcy by the counterparty to the agreement, realization
of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings. Use of Estimates -- The  
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles    
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates   
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at   
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and   
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those    
estimates.                                                                      

Other -- Expenses common to all funds within the Delaware Investments Family of 
Funds are allocated amongst the funds on the basis of average net assets.       
Security transactions are recorded on the date the securities are purchased or  
sold (trade date). Costs used in calculating realized gains and losses on the   
sale of investment securities are those of the specific securities sold.        
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are    
amortized to interest income over the lives of the respective securities.       
Realized gains (losses) on paydowns of mortgage- and asset-backed securities are
classified as interest income. The Fund declares dividends daily from net       
investment income and pays such dividends monthly and declares and pays         
distributions from net realized gain on investments, if any, annually.          

Certain expenses of the Fund are paid through commission arrangements with      
brokers. These transactions are done subject to best execution. The amount of   
these expenses was approximately $7,558 for the year ended December 31, 2002. In
addition, the Fund may receive earnings credits from its custodian when positive
cash balances are maintained, which are used to offset custody fees. There were 
no earnings credits for the year ended December 31, 2002. The expenses paid     
under the above arrangements are included in their respective expense captions  
on the Statement of Operations with the corresponding expense offset shown as   
"expenses paid indirectly".

2. Investment Management, Administration Agreements and Other                   
Transactions with Affiliates                                              
In accordance with the terms of its investment management agreement, the Fund   
pays Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Delaware Management Business
Trust and the investment manager, an annual fee which is calculated daily at the
rate of 0.50% on the first $500 million of average daily net assets of the Fund,
0.475% on the next $500 million, 0.45% on the next $1.5 billion, and 0.425% on  
average daily net assets in excess of $2.5 billion.                             

DMC has contracted to waive that portion, if any, of its management fee and     
reimburse the Fund to the extent necessary to ensure that annual operating      
expenses, exclusive of taxes, interest, brokerage commissions, distribution     
fees, and extraordinary expenses, do not exceed 0.60% of average daily net      
assets of the Fund through February 28, 2004.                                   

The Fund has engaged Delaware Service Company, Inc. (DSC), an affiliate of DMC, 
to provide dividend disbursing, transfer agent, accounting and administration   
services. The Fund pays DSC a monthly fee based on the number of shareholder    
accounts, shareholder transactions, and average net assets, subject to certain  
minimums.                                                                       

Pursuant to a distribution agreement, the Fund pays Delaware Distributors, L.P. 
(DDLP), the distributor and an affiliate of DMC, an annual fee not to exceed    
0.30% of the average daily net assets of the Class A shares and 1.00% of the    
average daily net assets of the Class B and C shares. No distribution expenses  
are paid by Institutional Class shares. The Board of Trustees, has set the fee  
at an annual rate of 0.15% of the Class A shares average daily net assets.      

At December 31, 2002, the Fund had liabilities payable to affiliates as follows:

Dividend disbursing, transfer agent fees,                                   
accounting and other expenses payable to DSC         $ 73,583         
Other expenses payable to DMC and affiliates              44,663

6. Futures Contracts                                                            
The Fund may invest in financial futures contracts to hedge its existing        
portfolio securities against fluctuations in fair value caused by changes in    
prevailing market interest rates. Upon entering into a futures contract, the    
Fund deposits cash or pledges U.S. government securities to a broker, equal to  
the minimum "initial margin" requirements of the exchange on which the contract 
is traded. (In some cases, due to the form of the futures agreement, initial    
margin is held in a segregated account with the Fund's custodian, rather than   
directly with the broker). Subsequent payments are received from the broker or  
paid to the broker, (or added to the segregated account) each day, based on the 
daily fluctuation in the market value of the contract. These receipts or        
payments are known as "variation margin" and are recorded daily by the Fund as  
unrealized gains or losses until the contracts are closed. When the contracts   
are closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference    
between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the
time it was closed. Risk of entering into futures contracts include potential   
imperfect correlation between the futures contracts and the underlying          
securities and the possibility of an illiquid secondary market for these        
instruments.

                                                           ===========

*  10 Year Swap Future is based on the notional price of a 10-year interest     
rate swap that has notional principal equal to $100,000 and that exchanges
semiannual interest payments at a fixed rate of 6% per annum for floating 
interest rate payments based on 3-month LIBOR.                            

The use of futures contracts involves elements of market risk and risks in      
excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements. The notional amount
presented above represents the Fund's total exposure in such contracts, whereas 
only the net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is reflected in the Fund's  
net assets.                                                                     

7. Written Options                                                              
During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund entered into options contracts
in accordance with its investment objectives. When the Fund writes an option, a 
premium is received and a liability is recorded and adjusted on a daily basis to
reflect the current market value of the options written. Premiums received from 
writing options that expire unexercised are treated by the Fund on the          
expiration date as realized gains. The difference between the premium received  
and the amount paid on effecting a closing purchase transaction, including      
brokerage commissions, is treated as realized gain or loss. If a call option is 
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying 
security in determining whether the Fund has a realized gain or loss. If a put  
option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the securities       
purchased by the Fund. The Fund, as writer of an option, bears the market risk  
of an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written    
option.                                                                         

Transactions in options written during the year ended December 31, 2002 for the 
Fund were as follows:

Writing options involves elements of market risk and risks in excess of the     
amount recognized in the financial statements. The notional amount presented    
above represents the Fund's total exposure in such contracts, whereas only the  
net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is reflected in the Fund's net       
assets.                                                                         

8. Swap Agreements                                                              
During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund entered into total return swap
agreements in accordance with its investment objectives. A swap is an agreement 
to exchange the return generated by one instrument for the return generated by  
another instrument. Total return swaps involve commitments to pay interest in   
exchange for a market linked return based on a notional amount. To the extent   
the total return of the security, instrument or basket of instruments underlying
the transaction exceeds the offsetting interest obligation, the Fund will       
receive a payment from the counterparty. To the extent the total return of the  
security, instrument or basket of instruments underlying the transaction falls  
short of the offsetting interest obligation, the Fund will make a payment to the
counterparty. Total return swaps are marked-to-market daily based upon the fair 
valuation methodology established by the Funds' Board of Trustees. The change in
value of swap agreements outstanding, if any, is recorded as unrealized         
appreciation or depreciation daily. A realized gain or loss is recorded on      
maturity or termination of the swap agreement.                                  

At December 31, 2002, the Fund had the following total return swap agreements   
outstanding:

TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)                                       

8. Swap Agreements (continued)                                                  
Because there is no organized market for these swap agreements, the value of    
open swaps may differ from that which would be realized in the event the Fund   
terminated its position in the agreement. Risks of entering into these          
agreements include the potential inability of the counterparty to meet the terms
of the agreement. This type of risk is generally limited to the amount of       
favorable movements in the value of the underlying security, instrument or      
basket of instruments, if any, at the day of default. Risks could also arise    
from potential losses from adverse market movements and such losses could exceed
the related amounts shown above.                                                

9. Credit and Market Risk                                                       
The Fund invests in fixed-income securities whose value is derived from an      
underlying pool of mortgages or consumer loans. Investors receive principal and 
interest payments as the underlying mortgages and consumer loans are paid back. 
Some of these securities are collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). CMOs   
are debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies or by financial          
institutions and other mortgage lenders, which are collateralized by a pool of  
mortgage held under an indenture. The Fund invests in private-backed CMOs only  
if they are 100% collateralized at the time of issuance by securities or        
certificates issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or       
instrumentalities. Prepayment of mortgages may shorten the stated maturity of   
the obligation and can result in a loss of premium, if any has been paid.       

10. Line of Credit                                                              
The Fund, along with certain other funds in the Delaware Investments Family of  
Funds (the "Participants"), participates in a $202,300,000 revolving line of    
credit facility to be used for temporary or emergency purposes as an additional 
source of liquidity to fund redemptions of investor shares. The Participants are
charged an annual commitment fee, which is allocated across the Participants on 
the basis of each fund's allocation of the entire facility. The Participants may
borrow up to a maximum of one third of their net assets under the agreement. The
Fund had no amount outstanding as of December 31, 2002, or at any time during   
the period.                                                                     

11. Tax Information (Unaudited)                                                 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund designates distributions  
paid during the year as follows:                                                

(A)                    (B)

OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS                                                   

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees                                       
Delaware Group Limited-Term Government Funds -- Delaware                        
Limited-Term Government Fund                                                    

We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets of Delaware            
Limited-Term Government Fund (the "Fund") as of December 31, 2002, and the      
related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of      
changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and   
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended.   
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of   
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these     
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.              

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and       
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes       
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included      
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2002, by correspondence with
the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where     
replies from brokers were not received. An audit also includes assessing the    
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of       
Delaware Limited-Term Government Fund at December 31, 2002, the results of its  
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of   
the two years in the period then ended, and its financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting          
principles generally accepted in the United States.

This annual report is for the information of Delaware Limited-Term Government   
Fund shareholders, but it may be used with prospective investors when preceded  
or accompanied by a current prospectus for Delaware Limited-Term Government Fund
and the Delaware Investments Performance Update for the most recently completed 
calendar quarter. The prospectus sets forth details about charges, expenses,    
investment objectives, and operating policies of the Fund. You should read the  
prospectus carefully before you invest. The figures in this report represent    
past results which are not a guarantee of future results. The return and        
principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, when
redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Macquarie Investment Management's structure of distinct investment teams allows for a style-specific research effort tailored for each asset class and, we believe, provides for a deeper understanding of each company we research. In short, we believe that distinct research teams add significant value to the investment management process — by reducing risk.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses and their summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting delawarefunds.com/literature or calling 800 523-1918. Investors should read the prospectus and the summary prospectus carefully before investing.
Consult your financial intermediary (which may be your financial advisor or other financial entity) to determine if investing in a fund is appropriate for your investment goals and time frame. It is the responsibility of your financial intermediary to help you determine if it is appropriate for you to invest in a fund, including the most appropriate share class to invest in, and to communicate such determination to us.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.
