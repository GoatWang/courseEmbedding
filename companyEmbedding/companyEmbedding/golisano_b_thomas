Blase Thomas "Tom" Golisano (born November 14, 1941)[2] is an American businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder of Paychex, which offers payroll and human resources services to businesses, and former co-owner (along with real estate developer Larry Quinn) of the Buffalo Sabres hockey team and of the Buffalo Bandits lacrosse team. He sold the Sabres and its assets to multi-billionaire Terrence Pegula in February 2011. Golisano made a bid for the bankrupt Los Angeles Dodgers franchise in early 2012;[3] but his group was eventually outbid by a consortium led by Magic Johnson and the Guggenheim Partners. In order to help keep the team in western NY, he also made a bid for the Buffalo Bills when that franchise came up for sale in 2014.[4] Golisano has an associate's degree from Alfred State College.
He is a founding member of the Independence Party of New York and ran on its ticket for governor of New York in 1994, 1998 and 2002. Although he was never elected, his percentage of the vote increased with each election. He spent a combined $93 million on the three campaigns.[5] By receiving more than 50,000 votes each time, Golisano brought the Independence Party an automatic ballot line for the succeeding four years. There was speculation that he would run for governor again on the Republican ticket, but it was announced, on May 15, 2009, that he was moving to Florida.[6]

Political involvement[edit]
After New York's Republican governor, George Pataki announced he would not run again in the 2006 election, Republican officials attempted to recruit Golisano to run for the Republican nomination. He changed his party affiliation to Republican, with the Independence Party's chairman's blessing, in October 2005, apparently in preparation for another gubernatorial run. On February 1, 2006, however, Golisano announced that he would not run for the governorship.[7]
In August 2008, Golisano contributed $1 million to the Democratic National Convention.[8]
In July 2008, Golisano formed a PAC called Responsible New York and funded it with $5 million of his own money. The PAC gives money to candidates for the New York state legislature, regardless of party. The PAC is aiming to support candidates for property tax cuts and election reform.[8]
In October 2008, Golisano voiced his opinion in favor of term limits for public offices in the New York City. Golisano vowed to fight Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal to extend term limits, arguing that the people of New York City have voted twice in favor of the current law.[9]
In June 2009, Golisano took partial credit for creating the 2009 New York State Senate leadership crisis in which Republican seized control of a body that still retained a Democratic majority. Golisano, who had supported a number of Democratic Party candidates during the 2008 election, was dissatisfied with things like the Democrats' to solve the state's budget crisis by raising taxes on New York's wealthiest residents. He orchestrated the defection of Democratic senators Pedro Espada Jr. and Hiram Monserrate, who voted with Republicans to reinstate Dean Skelos as majority leader.[10]
In February 2011, Golisano became the spokesman for National Popular Vote Inc., a non-profit organization seeking to implement a popular vote system for presidential elections by harnessing the electoral college.[11]
Philanthropy[edit]
He founded the B. Thomas Golisano Foundation in 1985 with an initial gift of $90,000. The Foundation awards grants to organizations dedicated to providing opportunities for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families.[12] The Foundation has assets exceeding $32 million and awards about $2 million in grants annually to organizations primarily in western and upstate New York and Florida. Golisano's personal and foundation philanthropy to health care, education, and other organizations now totals more than $267 million. There are three children's hospitals named for him. (Rochester, NY, Syracuse, NY and Fort Myers, Florida)
In 2017, in Austria, at the Special Olympics World Games, the first Golisano Global Health Care Leadership Award s will be announced and presented to recognize those who are advancing inclusive health for people around the world with intelletual disabilities.
In September 2016, Golisano gave $7.5 million to Nazareth College for a new Athletic Training Center that will be a model of inclusion, fitness and wellness. It is expected to open in 2018.
Also in September 2016, Golisano gave $2 million to WXXI Public Broadcasting for state-of-the-art equipment. This is his second gift to WXXI. He gave $2 million in 2004, to upgrade to digital broadcasting equipment.[13]
In June 2016, the new Golisano Center for Community Health opened its doors to patients. The center, which provides comprehensive integrated health care to people with disabilities and their families, was made possible with a gift of $3.5 million from Golisano.[14]
Tom Golisano and the Golisano Foundation were recognized among 30 great givers and causes on Forbes' "Philanthropy's Big Bets for Social Change of 2015."[15]
In 2012 Golisano donated $12 million to Special Olympics in 2012 to launch the Healthy Communities initiative to increase year-round access to health care for people with intellectual disabilities. He made an additional commitment of $25 million to Special Olympics in 2015 to expand Healthy Communities to 100 locations around the world. This was the largest single gift to an organization made by Golisano and the largest single gifts ever received from an individual by Special Olympics.[16]
Also on 2012, Golisano donated $20 million in 2012 to build a new Golisano Children's Hospital at Lee Health in southwest Florida. The new hospital will open in Spring 2017.[17]
In 2014, The Golisano Neurology and Rehabilitation Center opened at Unity Hospital in Rochester, New York, funded in part by a $10 million contribution by Golisano.
In November 2009, Golisano donated $4 million to Ave Maria University for the construction of a new field house.[18]
On October 8, 2008, Golisano donated $10 million to Niagara University for a new B. Thomas Golisano Center for Integrated Sciences building that was named in his honor.
Golisano donated $14 million to the University of Rochester, which renamed their pediatric facility at Strong Memorial Hospital in his honor as the Golisano Children's Hospital in 2002. In 2012 Golisano pledged an additional $20 million to URMC to build a new Golisano Children's Hospital, which opened in 2015.
In October 2003, Golisano donated $5 million to Nazareth College, which named the new Golisano Academic Center in his honor. In July 2004, he made a $5 million gift to Hartwick College of Oneonta, New York, which was used to build a new academic building for the social science and management programs, and has been named Golisano Hall. On March 6, 2006, Golisano donated $6 million to Bishop Kearney High School and Our Lady of Mercy High School.
Golisano was a founding sponsor of the Clinton Global Initiative and was an underwriter of CGI's annual meeting for nine years from 2005 through 2013.In 2005 Golisano contributed $6 million to the Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse for a new children's hospital. The hospital was named Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital in his honor.
In February 2001 Golisano donated $14 million to the Rochester Institute of Technology for the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences. He donated an additional $10 million to RIT for the new Golisano Institute for Sustainability there in 2007.

Blase Thomas "Tom" Golisano (born November 14, 1941)[2] is an American businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder of Paychex, which offers payroll and human resources services to businesses, and former co-owner (along with real estate developer Larry Quinn) of the Buffalo Sabres hockey team and of the Buffalo Bandits lacrosse team. He sold the Sabres and its assets to multi-billionaire Terrence Pegula in February 2011. Golisano made a bid for the bankrupt Los Angeles Dodgers franchise in early 2012;[3] but his group was eventually outbid by a consortium led by Magic Johnson and the Guggenheim Partners. In order to help keep the team in western NY, he also made a bid for the Buffalo Bills when that franchise came up for sale in 2014.[4] Golisano has an associate's degree from Alfred State College.
He is a founding member of the Independence Party of New York and ran on its ticket for governor of New York in 1994, 1998 and 2002. Although he was never elected, his percentage of the vote increased with each election. He spent a combined $93 million on the three campaigns.[5] By receiving more than 50,000 votes each time, Golisano brought the Independence Party an automatic ballot line for the succeeding four years. There was speculation that he would run for governor again on the Republican ticket, but it was announced, on May 15, 2009, that he was moving to Florida.[6]

Political involvement[edit]
After New York's Republican governor, George Pataki announced he would not run again in the 2006 election, Republican officials attempted to recruit Golisano to run for the Republican nomination. He changed his party affiliation to Republican, with the Independence Party's chairman's blessing, in October 2005, apparently in preparation for another gubernatorial run. On February 1, 2006, however, Golisano announced that he would not run for the governorship.[7]
In August 2008, Golisano contributed $1 million to the Democratic National Convention.[8]
In July 2008, Golisano formed a PAC called Responsible New York and funded it with $5 million of his own money. The PAC gives money to candidates for the New York state legislature, regardless of party. The PAC is aiming to support candidates for property tax cuts and election reform.[8]
In October 2008, Golisano voiced his opinion in favor of term limits for public offices in the New York City. Golisano vowed to fight Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal to extend term limits, arguing that the people of New York City have voted twice in favor of the current law.[9]
In June 2009, Golisano took partial credit for creating the 2009 New York State Senate leadership crisis in which Republican seized control of a body that still retained a Democratic majority. Golisano, who had supported a number of Democratic Party candidates during the 2008 election, was dissatisfied with things like the Democrats' to solve the state's budget crisis by raising taxes on New York's wealthiest residents. He orchestrated the defection of Democratic senators Pedro Espada Jr. and Hiram Monserrate, who voted with Republicans to reinstate Dean Skelos as majority leader.[10]
In February 2011, Golisano became the spokesman for National Popular Vote Inc., a non-profit organization seeking to implement a popular vote system for presidential elections by harnessing the electoral college.[11]
Philanthropy[edit]
He founded the B. Thomas Golisano Foundation in 1985 with an initial gift of $90,000. The Foundation awards grants to organizations dedicated to providing opportunities for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families.[12] The Foundation has assets exceeding $32 million and awards about $2 million in grants annually to organizations primarily in western and upstate New York and Florida. Golisano's personal and foundation philanthropy to health care, education, and other organizations now totals more than $267 million. There are three children's hospitals named for him. (Rochester, NY, Syracuse, NY and Fort Myers, Florida)
In 2017, in Austria, at the Special Olympics World Games, the first Golisano Global Health Care Leadership Award s will be announced and presented to recognize those who are advancing inclusive health for people around the world with intelletual disabilities.
In September 2016, Golisano gave $7.5 million to Nazareth College for a new Athletic Training Center that will be a model of inclusion, fitness and wellness. It is expected to open in 2018.
Also in September 2016, Golisano gave $2 million to WXXI Public Broadcasting for state-of-the-art equipment. This is his second gift to WXXI. He gave $2 million in 2004, to upgrade to digital broadcasting equipment.[13]
In June 2016, the new Golisano Center for Community Health opened its doors to patients. The center, which provides comprehensive integrated health care to people with disabilities and their families, was made possible with a gift of $3.5 million from Golisano.[14]
Tom Golisano and the Golisano Foundation were recognized among 30 great givers and causes on Forbes' "Philanthropy's Big Bets for Social Change of 2015."[15]
In 2012 Golisano donated $12 million to Special Olympics in 2012 to launch the Healthy Communities initiative to increase year-round access to health care for people with intellectual disabilities. He made an additional commitment of $25 million to Special Olympics in 2015 to expand Healthy Communities to 100 locations around the world. This was the largest single gift to an organization made by Golisano and the largest single gifts ever received from an individual by Special Olympics.[16]
Also on 2012, Golisano donated $20 million in 2012 to build a new Golisano Children's Hospital at Lee Health in southwest Florida. The new hospital will open in Spring 2017.[17]
In 2014, The Golisano Neurology and Rehabilitation Center opened at Unity Hospital in Rochester, New York, funded in part by a $10 million contribution by Golisano.
In November 2009, Golisano donated $4 million to Ave Maria University for the construction of a new field house.[18]
On October 8, 2008, Golisano donated $10 million to Niagara University for a new B. Thomas Golisano Center for Integrated Sciences building that was named in his honor.
Golisano donated $14 million to the University of Rochester, which renamed their pediatric facility at Strong Memorial Hospital in his honor as the Golisano Children's Hospital in 2002. In 2012 Golisano pledged an additional $20 million to URMC to build a new Golisano Children's Hospital, which opened in 2015.
In October 2003, Golisano donated $5 million to Nazareth College, which named the new Golisano Academic Center in his honor. In July 2004, he made a $5 million gift to Hartwick College of Oneonta, New York, which was used to build a new academic building for the social science and management programs, and has been named Golisano Hall. On March 6, 2006, Golisano donated $6 million to Bishop Kearney High School and Our Lady of Mercy High School.
Golisano was a founding sponsor of the Clinton Global Initiative and was an underwriter of CGI's annual meeting for nine years from 2005 through 2013.In 2005 Golisano contributed $6 million to the Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse for a new children's hospital. The hospital was named Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital in his honor.
In February 2001 Golisano donated $14 million to the Rochester Institute of Technology for the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences. He donated an additional $10 million to RIT for the new Golisano Institute for Sustainability there in 2007.

Golisano Health Leadership Awards
Special Olympics, the largest public health organization for people with intellectual disabilities,  launched the Golisano Health Leadership Awards in September 2016 to recognize the extensive work of individuals and organizations around the world who are improving the health of people with intellectual disabilities and advancing the year-round health work of Special Olympics. Read more

Positive Exposure
The Golisano Foundation  presented the premiere of the photographic exhibition, Positive Exposure - Change How You See, See How You Change, from October 2-18, 2015 at George Eastman Museum in Rochester, NY. This exhibition was created in celebration of the Golisano Foundation's 30th anniversary and featured 20 portraits of people living with intellectual disabilities,  providing the opportunity to see beyond all labels or disabilities. This exhibition presented our ambassadors as the beautiful, vibrant individuals that they are. Read more 

Move to Include Awards - 2015
The Golisano Foundation presented its first ever Move to Include Awards on October 15th to six individuals: Julie J. Christensen, PhD, LMSW; Rick Guidotti; Daniel M. Meyers; Martha E. Mock, PhD; Joseph A. Ruffolo; and Shirley F. Szekeres, PhD, CCC-SLP. The Move to Include Awards recognize those who believe and act in the purest realm of the essence of "move to include."  The award is named after the Move to Include initiative launched in 2013 with WXXI to advance inclusion. Read more

Move to Include
WXXI and the Golisano Foundation have joined forces to launch MOVE TO INCLUDE, an initiative designed to promote inclusion for people with intellectual and physical disabilities. Through programming and special events, the goal is to build a more inclusive community by inspiring and motivating people to embrace different abilities and include all people in every aspect of community life. Read more

Healthy Communities
With an initial $12 million donation from Tom Golisano in 2012, Special Olympics was able to launch Healthy Communities, an initiative to expand its health-related services to people with intellectual disabilities. The program was a success prompting Mr. Golisano to donate an additional $25 million in 2015 to expand the program to more than 100 Healthy Communities over the next five years. 
Healthy Communities was first launched in eight countries (Mexico, Peru, Romania, Malawi, South Africa, Malaysia, Kazakhstan and Thailand) and six states in the U.S. (Arizona, Florida, Kansas, New Jersey, Wisconsin and New York).  It is building upon and broadening the scope of Healthy Athletes, which has provided free health screenings and products to athletes for almost two decades.

    Healthy Communities’ goal is to achieve improved health outcomes for people with intellectual disabilities with the ultimate goal of ensuring that all are receiving health services and are able to reach their full potential. It will expand services to more athletes, increase partnerships with local organizations, expand the use of technology, and promote awareness of the health difficulties facing people with intellectual disabilities.

Spread the Word to End the “R” Word
The Golisano Foundation has been challenging people to Spread the Word to End the R-Word™ (the word retard or retarded) for six year now. In 2016, the Foundation also encouraged  participation from its supporters in western New York and Florid. The Foundation's annual campaign has become one of the largest in the country for a single region and is held on the national Spread the Word to End the Word day of awareness in early March. Schools, non-profits, businesses and many other organizations ask people to pledge to take a stand against using the R-word, "retard" or "retarded."  The r-word has gained popularity in culture, but is offensive and derogatory to people with developmental disabilities. Spread the Word to End the Word was started by youth and is an ongoing effort of Special Olympics International and Best Buddies.

Golisano Foundation and Eastman Institute for Oral Health Partner to Help People with Developmental Disabilities
The Golisano Foundation and Eastman Institute for Oral Health at the University of Rochester Medical Center have partnered to  address the unmet oral health needs of people with developmental disabilities in the Rochester area. While it is widely known that there is a critical lack of trained and experienced dental providers to work with people with developmental disabilities, no concrete data exists related to the extent and type of unmet need for the estimated 135,000 New Yorkers affected. 
For the first time ever, a community task force of experts,  engaged the community and help in the process of gathering reliable data in area counties to determine the areas of significant need, clarify available resources, identify gaps and barriers for meeting needs, and develop realistic and practical recommendations to improve this complex situation.

Collaborative Community Transition Planning Process


Read Report to the Community:          In the Balance: Successfully Transitioning to a
        Meaningful Adult Life

This report was funded by the Golisano Foundation. 
      In April of 2006, over one hundred members of the Greater Rochester, New York
      community—youth with developmental disabilities and supportive family members, educators, 
      administrators, advocates, community leaders, state agency and adult services personnel—
      gathered to begin a comprehensive examination of the transition process from high school to the 
      adult world for students with developmental disabilities. Since then we have convened Expert 
      Panels, reviewed data, explored best practices and held many discussions to provide us with 
      further information and insights on transition.
 The data we gathered in this process is largely qualitative and relies on people's
      perceptions of their experiences. Strong themes emerged in the discussions by the Expert Panels.

      National and statewide data and the local voices of individuals, families, and
      professionals tell us that students with developmental disabilities are struggling through the 
      transition process and not realizing their hopes and dreams. The gaps in experiences and 
      outcomes between students with developmental disabilities and students without disabilities 
      demand our attention.

Blase Thomas "Tom" Golisano (born November 14, 1941)[2] is an American businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder of Paychex, which offers payroll and human resources services to businesses, and former co-owner (along with real estate developer Larry Quinn) of the Buffalo Sabres hockey team and of the Buffalo Bandits lacrosse team. He sold the Sabres and its assets to multi-billionaire Terrence Pegula in February 2011. Golisano made a bid for the bankrupt Los Angeles Dodgers franchise in early 2012;[3] but his group was eventually outbid by a consortium led by Magic Johnson and the Guggenheim Partners. In order to help keep the team in western NY, he also made a bid for the Buffalo Bills when that franchise came up for sale in 2014.[4] Golisano has an associate's degree from Alfred State College.
He is a founding member of the Independence Party of New York and ran on its ticket for governor of New York in 1994, 1998 and 2002. Although he was never elected, his percentage of the vote increased with each election. He spent a combined $93 million on the three campaigns.[5] By receiving more than 50,000 votes each time, Golisano brought the Independence Party an automatic ballot line for the succeeding four years. There was speculation that he would run for governor again on the Republican ticket, but it was announced, on May 15, 2009, that he was moving to Florida.[6]

Political involvement[edit]
After New York's Republican governor, George Pataki announced he would not run again in the 2006 election, Republican officials attempted to recruit Golisano to run for the Republican nomination. He changed his party affiliation to Republican, with the Independence Party's chairman's blessing, in October 2005, apparently in preparation for another gubernatorial run. On February 1, 2006, however, Golisano announced that he would not run for the governorship.[7]
In August 2008, Golisano contributed $1 million to the Democratic National Convention.[8]
In July 2008, Golisano formed a PAC called Responsible New York and funded it with $5 million of his own money. The PAC gives money to candidates for the New York state legislature, regardless of party. The PAC is aiming to support candidates for property tax cuts and election reform.[8]
In October 2008, Golisano voiced his opinion in favor of term limits for public offices in the New York City. Golisano vowed to fight Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal to extend term limits, arguing that the people of New York City have voted twice in favor of the current law.[9]
In June 2009, Golisano took partial credit for creating the 2009 New York State Senate leadership crisis in which Republican seized control of a body that still retained a Democratic majority. Golisano, who had supported a number of Democratic Party candidates during the 2008 election, was dissatisfied with things like the Democrats' to solve the state's budget crisis by raising taxes on New York's wealthiest residents. He orchestrated the defection of Democratic senators Pedro Espada Jr. and Hiram Monserrate, who voted with Republicans to reinstate Dean Skelos as majority leader.[10]
In February 2011, Golisano became the spokesman for National Popular Vote Inc., a non-profit organization seeking to implement a popular vote system for presidential elections by harnessing the electoral college.[11]
Philanthropy[edit]
He founded the B. Thomas Golisano Foundation in 1985 with an initial gift of $90,000. The Foundation awards grants to organizations dedicated to providing opportunities for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families.[12] The Foundation has assets exceeding $32 million and awards about $2 million in grants annually to organizations primarily in western and upstate New York and Florida. Golisano's personal and foundation philanthropy to health care, education, and other organizations now totals more than $267 million. There are three children's hospitals named for him. (Rochester, NY, Syracuse, NY and Fort Myers, Florida)
In 2017, in Austria, at the Special Olympics World Games, the first Golisano Global Health Care Leadership Award s will be announced and presented to recognize those who are advancing inclusive health for people around the world with intelletual disabilities.
In September 2016, Golisano gave $7.5 million to Nazareth College for a new Athletic Training Center that will be a model of inclusion, fitness and wellness. It is expected to open in 2018.
Also in September 2016, Golisano gave $2 million to WXXI Public Broadcasting for state-of-the-art equipment. This is his second gift to WXXI. He gave $2 million in 2004, to upgrade to digital broadcasting equipment.[13]
In June 2016, the new Golisano Center for Community Health opened its doors to patients. The center, which provides comprehensive integrated health care to people with disabilities and their families, was made possible with a gift of $3.5 million from Golisano.[14]
Tom Golisano and the Golisano Foundation were recognized among 30 great givers and causes on Forbes' "Philanthropy's Big Bets for Social Change of 2015."[15]
In 2012 Golisano donated $12 million to Special Olympics in 2012 to launch the Healthy Communities initiative to increase year-round access to health care for people with intellectual disabilities. He made an additional commitment of $25 million to Special Olympics in 2015 to expand Healthy Communities to 100 locations around the world. This was the largest single gift to an organization made by Golisano and the largest single gifts ever received from an individual by Special Olympics.[16]
Also on 2012, Golisano donated $20 million in 2012 to build a new Golisano Children's Hospital at Lee Health in southwest Florida. The new hospital will open in Spring 2017.[17]
In 2014, The Golisano Neurology and Rehabilitation Center opened at Unity Hospital in Rochester, New York, funded in part by a $10 million contribution by Golisano.
In November 2009, Golisano donated $4 million to Ave Maria University for the construction of a new field house.[18]
On October 8, 2008, Golisano donated $10 million to Niagara University for a new B. Thomas Golisano Center for Integrated Sciences building that was named in his honor.
Golisano donated $14 million to the University of Rochester, which renamed their pediatric facility at Strong Memorial Hospital in his honor as the Golisano Children's Hospital in 2002. In 2012 Golisano pledged an additional $20 million to URMC to build a new Golisano Children's Hospital, which opened in 2015.
In October 2003, Golisano donated $5 million to Nazareth College, which named the new Golisano Academic Center in his honor. In July 2004, he made a $5 million gift to Hartwick College of Oneonta, New York, which was used to build a new academic building for the social science and management programs, and has been named Golisano Hall. On March 6, 2006, Golisano donated $6 million to Bishop Kearney High School and Our Lady of Mercy High School.
Golisano was a founding sponsor of the Clinton Global Initiative and was an underwriter of CGI's annual meeting for nine years from 2005 through 2013.In 2005 Golisano contributed $6 million to the Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse for a new children's hospital. The hospital was named Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital in his honor.
In February 2001 Golisano donated $14 million to the Rochester Institute of Technology for the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences. He donated an additional $10 million to RIT for the new Golisano Institute for Sustainability there in 2007.

Golisano Children's Hospital / Tom Golisano Pledges $20 Million to Jumpstart Hospital Dedicated to Children / More about Thomas Golisano




About B. Thomas Golisano






		B. Thomas Golisano


	B. Thomas Golisano founded Paychex, Inc. in 1971 and is chairman of the company’s board. Until October 2004, he served as president and chief executive officer of the company. As much as he is known as a savvy businessman who built – from the ground up – a top national provider of payroll and business solutions, Golisano is also known as a generous philanthropist.

	Since 1985, Golisano has donated more than $145 million to charities, including a combined total $32 million to Golisano Children’s Hospital at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Golisano’s 2002 gift of $14 million transformed the hospital, especially its critical care services for kids. In addition, the Golisano Foundation, which he founded in 1985, has given $1.6 million to the University of Rochester’s Strong Center for Developmental Disabilities to establish the Institute for Innovative Transition, which serves young adults with developmental disabilities. Golisano’s new gift of $18 million will jumpstart the construction of a whole new facility designed to meet the medical needs of the region’s children and families.

	Golisano demonstrates ongoing generosity and commitment to the greater Rochester community, home of Paychex corporate headquarters, and other organizations in upstate and western New York. He has focused much of his giving on healthcare, education and services for those with intellectual disabilities. For example, a 2010 gift to Special Olympics International expanded training and increased the number of health care professionals to provide screenings at Special Olympics events to help meet the unmet healthcare needs of people with intellectual disabilities, and ensure that athletes can receive follow-up care.

	Golisano has made transformative donations to every health system in the Rochester area, to Upstate Golisano Children’s Hospital in Syracuse, and many higher education institutions in western New York including Rochester Institute of Technology and Niagara University.

	Golisano, is the founding sponsor of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Annual Meeting, and is the major underwriter this year for the sixth consecutive year. The CGI convenes global leaders to devise and implement innovative solutions to some of the world's most pressing challenges in the areas of education, poverty, health and the environment.

	A native of Irondequoit, NY, a suburb of Rochester, Golisano is a graduate of the State University of New York at Alfred.
