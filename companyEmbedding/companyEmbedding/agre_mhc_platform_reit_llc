ETRE Financial Launches Real Time Platform for Commercial Real Estate

		  Enables Trading of Shares of Individual Commercial Real Estate Assets and Improves Transparency of the Overall REIT Market
		

Oct 23, 2013, 09:15 ET
		  		  					
						 from   ETRE Financial, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Oct. 23, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- ETRE Financial, LLC ("ETRE"), a real estate financial services and technology company, today announced the launch of a first-of-its-kind exchange-traded real estate platform for investing in shares of individual commercial real estate assets and portfolio REITs listed on national exchanges. The ETRE platform incorporates capital advisory, asset management, trading and credit analysis to provide an end-to-end solution for liquid, transparent and accessible real estate investing and information analysis.
ETRE seeks to broaden the investment opportunity in commercial real estate through creation of the Electronic Traded Property ("ETP") and through a new process for investing in individual commercial real estate assets. To facilitate investment in individual commercial assets, ETRE has introduced mark-to-market technology for ETP and REIT equity shares that innovates mark-to-market simultaneous pricing in price per share, price per square foot, price per unit, and price per key in real time.
"ETRE is the next evolutionary step in real estate investing," said Paul Frischer, ETRE's co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. "Building on the established framework of REIT equities and the benefits of underlying pooled real estate assets, investors in the public market have sought the opportunity to have access to individual commercial real estate properties as part of their portfolios. ETRE has filled this market demand through the introduction of Electronic Traded Properties, leading the way to listing and trading of single property REITs on national exchanges."
ETRE's proprietary trading platform and advisory services provide a complete order management system with an extensive collection of trade and market information to support superior analytics and trading for ETPs and portfolio REITs. The platform runs in a cloud environment that is available to institutional investors, traders, property owners, brokers, financial advisors and individual investors globally as a secure internet browser-based system.
"The ETRE platform delivers unprecedented transparency into publicly-traded real estate in real-time metrics for both equity and real estate investors," said Jesse Stein, ETRE's co-founder and Executive Managing Director. "The platform provides investors with the ability to create their own diversified real estate portfolios and allocate investments based on geographic, asset type, and yield criteria. The ETRE advisory service builds on these key factors to support owners and investors seeking to list individual commercial real estate assets on national exchanges."
To learn more about ETRE advisory services or to register for a trial demo of the ETRE Trader OMS platform, please visit www.etrefinancial.com.  
About ETRE FinancialETRE Financial, a real estate financial technology company, was founded in 2012 by a team of real estate professionals who sought to bring the benefits of the equities market – including liquidity, transparency and investor accessibility – to the commercial real estate market. ETRE encompasses capital advisory, asset management, trading and credit analysis systems to provide an end-to-end solution for liquid, transparent and accessible real estate investing in publicly-traded REITs and exchange-listed single asset commercial real estate properties.

Private Placements, Non-Traded REITs To Become More Transparent?
Posted on June 7, 2010


Non-traded REITs such as Behringer Harvard REIT I, Behringer Harvard Opportunity, Wells Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inland America Real Estate Trust and Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust may become more transparent thanks to a new platform under development by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC). 
As reported June 6 by Investment News, the intent of the platform it to provide standards, centralize data and automate transactions for alternative investments like private placements, non-traded real estate investment trusts, limited partnerships and hedge funds. Through the new platform, the DTCC will operate as a go-between among firms that create alternative investments and the broker/dealers and companies selling them.
The platform – called the Alternative Investment Product (AIP) – currently is being used by Pershing LLC. The Charles Schwab Corp. is testing it, according to the Investment News story, and National Financial Services LLC, a clearing unit of Fidelity Investments, plans to have it operating by 2011.
In the interim, about 15 DTCC- affiliated sponsors of alternative investment products are testing the platform.
Alternative investments like non-traded REITs and private placements have come under fire by regulators in recent months for their lack of transparency. In July 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed fraud charges against the Tustin, California, lender Medical Capital Holdings in connection to private placements that the company issued to more than 20,000 investors nationwide. 
Non-traded REITs also faced intense scrutiny lately. Last year, some of the most prominent non-traded REITs, including Behringer Harvard REIT I, Inland America Real Estate Trust, Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust and Piedmont Office Realty Trust slashed dividends to investors and/or shut down their redemption programs.  
The AIP is intended to standardize the way the alternative investment industry communicates information about these types of investments, providing more new clarity. 
“The challenge for many alternative investments is that they’re non-standardized,” said one anonymous industry executive in the June 6 Investment News story. “They’re not always priced and valued on a regular basis. This is an investor need, a broker/dealer need.”

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
