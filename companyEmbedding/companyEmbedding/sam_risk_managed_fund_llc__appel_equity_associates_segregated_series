Includes all share classes available for the fund
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund, Franklin Large Cap Equity Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin Ultra-Short California Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

 Fact SheetMar 31, 2017







The Fund
The Fund's investment objective is total return. The Fund seeks its objective by investing in a core portfolio generally comprised of an approximately equal mix of equity securities and cash equivalents. The Fund's equity investments will generally consi st of a diversified portfolio of common stocks that seeks to approximate the pretax total return performance of the S&P 500® Index. The Fund's cash equivalent investments consist primarily of U.S. Treasury securities with a maximum remaining maturity  of one year. The Fund will write (sell) call options on the S&P 500® Index on substantially the full value of the Fund's equity securities and write (sell) put options on the S&P 500® Index on substantially the full value of the Fund's cash equi valent holdings.



The Approach
The Fund uses a disciplined implementation process that adapts to changing market volatility without the need for market timing or forecasts. By investing in a core portfolio of equity securities and cash equivalents the Fund creates implicit downside pr otection and partially exchanges the future possible gains from equities for the volatility risk premium. The income generated from option sales may offset the equity risk premium foregone.



The Features
The Fund is designed to capitalize on the tendency for volatility priced into an option to be higher, on average, than the volatility actually experienced on the securities underlying the option. Through the systematic sale of equity index options, inves tors may harvest the volatility risk premium without the use of leverage and market forecasts. Parametric's research has identified the volatility risk premium as a distinct and persistent return stream.







 

 OverviewS&P 500 Index options have traded with positive volatility risk premium (VRP) over 85% of the time.1

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. The share class has no sales charge.

About Risk: 
The effectiveness of the Fund's option strategy is dependent upon a general imbalance of natural buyers over natural sellers of index options. This imbalance could decrease or be eliminated, which could have an adverse effect on the Fund. Fund performanc e is sensitive to stock market volatility. Calls and puts written by the Fund will be based on the S&P 500 Index or a substitute for the S&P 500 Index. If the S&P 500 Index appreciates or depreciates sufficiently over the period to offset the net premium  received, the Fund will incur a net loss. ETFs are subject to the risks of investing in the underlying securities and the Fund will bear a pro rata portion of the operating expenses of an ETF in which it invests. Derivative instruments can be used to ta ke both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is base d, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterpar ty. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.



1. Source: Parametric, Bloomberg; Date: 1/3/2017. S&P 500® Index options relative valuation measured by taking daily observations of Implied Volatility (as measured by VIX Index) and subtracting the subsequent Realized Volatility of the S&P 500® ove r the following 30 days. Options have historically traded about 4.3 volatility points above subsequent realized volatility. Said another way, the option market tends to overestimate future volatility, which translates directly into higher prices for both  puts and calls. VIX is the Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index. VIX is calculated constantly throughout each trading day by observing the implied volatility derived from actual market prices of a wide array of put and call options with an av erage maturity of 30 days to expiration.
2. CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index measures the performance of a hypothetical buy-write strategy on the S&P 500 Index. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as  applicable. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.

4. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 5/31/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.
