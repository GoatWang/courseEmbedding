History[edit]
Founded as the Toro Motor Company in 1914 to build tractor engines for The Bull Tractor Company,[2] Toro manufactures and sells turf and landscape maintenance equipment and precision irrigation systems for use by landscape contractors, golf course superintendents, sports fields and grounds managers, as well as individual consumers.
In 1986, Toro acquired the Wheel Horse Products Division of American Motors (AMC).[3][4][5] Wheel Horse manufactured a wide range of lawn and garden tractors, as well as riding lawn mowers. The division was spun off from AMC so that the automaker could maintain focus on vehicles.
Lawn and garden tractors were then marketed under the Toro, Wheel Horse, as well as the Toro Wheel Horse names. Acquisitions continued with the purchase of Lawn-Boy in 1989, James Hardie Irrigation in 1996, Exmark Manufacturing in 1997, Hayter in 2005, Rain Master Irrigation Systems, and Turf Guard Wireless Monitoring Technology in 2007, TYCROP Manufacturing turf equipment product line in 2009, and USPraxis in 2010.
In the 1990s, then CEO Kendrick Melrose changed the company's strategy, shifting its focus to "professional maintenance markets" (such as golf courses, sports fields, municipal parks, and commercial properties). The strategy yielded higher margins and offered more protection from the uncertainty of weather and economic conditions than the highly competitive residential market segments. In 2007, almost 70 percent of the company's sales came from professional markets, versus one-third in 1990.
On Dec 5, 2001, Toro adopted new accounting rules the Emerging Issues Task Force had issued and restated the prior periods. The adoption of these rules had no effect on operating earnings or net income.
In 2007, the low-end lawn and garden tractor product manufacturing was outsourced to MTD Products, to be sold at Home Depot stores.[6]
In 2014, the snowplow and snow removal equipment company Boss Products was purchased by Toro.[7]
Brands[edit]
The company's products are marketed under several brands:[8]

Toro — irrigation systems & supplies, professional and consumer mowers, compact utility equipment, snow blowers, and handheld trimmers and leaf blowers. [9]
eXmark — commercial mowers. [10]
Lawn-Boy — consumer mowers. [11]
Irritrol Systems — irrigation systems for residential and commercial landscapes. [12]
Lawn Genie — consumer irrigation.
Pope (Australia) — garden maintenance solutions. [13]
Hayter (United Kingdom) — consumer and professional mowers. [14]
Unique Lighting — low voltage landscape lighting. [15]
Boss Snowplow — snow and ice removal.

History[edit]
Founded as the Toro Motor Company in 1914 to build tractor engines for The Bull Tractor Company,[2] Toro manufactures and sells turf and landscape maintenance equipment and precision irrigation systems for use by landscape contractors, golf course superintendents, sports fields and grounds managers, as well as individual consumers.
In 1986, Toro acquired the Wheel Horse Products Division of American Motors (AMC).[3][4][5] Wheel Horse manufactured a wide range of lawn and garden tractors, as well as riding lawn mowers. The division was spun off from AMC so that the automaker could maintain focus on vehicles.
Lawn and garden tractors were then marketed under the Toro, Wheel Horse, as well as the Toro Wheel Horse names. Acquisitions continued with the purchase of Lawn-Boy in 1989, James Hardie Irrigation in 1996, Exmark Manufacturing in 1997, Hayter in 2005, Rain Master Irrigation Systems, and Turf Guard Wireless Monitoring Technology in 2007, TYCROP Manufacturing turf equipment product line in 2009, and USPraxis in 2010.
In the 1990s, then CEO Kendrick Melrose changed the company's strategy, shifting its focus to "professional maintenance markets" (such as golf courses, sports fields, municipal parks, and commercial properties). The strategy yielded higher margins and offered more protection from the uncertainty of weather and economic conditions than the highly competitive residential market segments. In 2007, almost 70 percent of the company's sales came from professional markets, versus one-third in 1990.
On Dec 5, 2001, Toro adopted new accounting rules the Emerging Issues Task Force had issued and restated the prior periods. The adoption of these rules had no effect on operating earnings or net income.
In 2007, the low-end lawn and garden tractor product manufacturing was outsourced to MTD Products, to be sold at Home Depot stores.[6]
In 2014, the snowplow and snow removal equipment company Boss Products was purchased by Toro.[7]
Brands[edit]
The company's products are marketed under several brands:[8]

Toro — irrigation systems & supplies, professional and consumer mowers, compact utility equipment, snow blowers, and handheld trimmers and leaf blowers. [9]
eXmark — commercial mowers. [10]
Lawn-Boy — consumer mowers. [11]
Irritrol Systems — irrigation systems for residential and commercial landscapes. [12]
Lawn Genie — consumer irrigation.
Pope (Australia) — garden maintenance solutions. [13]
Hayter (United Kingdom) — consumer and professional mowers. [14]
Unique Lighting — low voltage landscape lighting. [15]
Boss Snowplow — snow and ice removal.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Founded as the Toro Motor Company in 1914 to build tractor engines for The Bull Tractor Company,[2] Toro manufactures and sells turf and landscape maintenance equipment and precision irrigation systems for use by landscape contractors, golf course superintendents, sports fields and grounds managers, as well as individual consumers.
In 1986, Toro acquired the Wheel Horse Products Division of American Motors (AMC).[3][4][5] Wheel Horse manufactured a wide range of lawn and garden tractors, as well as riding lawn mowers. The division was spun off from AMC so that the automaker could maintain focus on vehicles.
Lawn and garden tractors were then marketed under the Toro, Wheel Horse, as well as the Toro Wheel Horse names. Acquisitions continued with the purchase of Lawn-Boy in 1989, James Hardie Irrigation in 1996, Exmark Manufacturing in 1997, Hayter in 2005, Rain Master Irrigation Systems, and Turf Guard Wireless Monitoring Technology in 2007, TYCROP Manufacturing turf equipment product line in 2009, and USPraxis in 2010.
In the 1990s, then CEO Kendrick Melrose changed the company's strategy, shifting its focus to "professional maintenance markets" (such as golf courses, sports fields, municipal parks, and commercial properties). The strategy yielded higher margins and offered more protection from the uncertainty of weather and economic conditions than the highly competitive residential market segments. In 2007, almost 70 percent of the company's sales came from professional markets, versus one-third in 1990.
On Dec 5, 2001, Toro adopted new accounting rules the Emerging Issues Task Force had issued and restated the prior periods. The adoption of these rules had no effect on operating earnings or net income.
In 2007, the low-end lawn and garden tractor product manufacturing was outsourced to MTD Products, to be sold at Home Depot stores.[6]
In 2014, the snowplow and snow removal equipment company Boss Products was purchased by Toro.[7]

The company's products are marketed under several brands:[8]

Toro — irrigation systems & supplies, professional and consumer mowers, compact utility equipment, snow blowers, and handheld trimmers and leaf blowers. [9]

In order to avoid waste and help the environment, a side discharge chute was not included with your purchase (since most customers prefer to mulch or bag their grass clippings). If you do want to use a side discharge chute for your clippings in the future, check the box below and Toro will send a side discharge chute to you at no additional charge. Allow 4-5 weeks for delivery.

Irrigation FAQ            







Sprinkler System Basics
The three main components of every automatic sprinkler system are the controller, station-control valves and sprinklers.
The controller is the brain of the system, telling the control valves when and how long to supply water to the sprinklers. The sprinklers direct and control the water applied to the lawn and plants.
Each valve controls a specific group of sprinklers called a watering station. The stations are generally laid out and installed according to the type of plant material to be watered, the location of the plant within the landscape and the maximum amount of water that can be supplied. Each valve is connected to a numbered terminal within the controller, identifying it as Station 1, Station 2, etc.
The controller operates the valves in order, one at a time. In other words, one station would water completely before another station would turn on. This is called a watering cycle. The information stored in the controller memory that determines when and how long the stations will water is called a program.
What is a watering program?
A watering program requires three basic instructions to operate automatically: 

What days to water - called watering days
When to water - called a program start time
How long to water - called station run time

Why do some controllers have multiple programs?
Many yards have plants with different water requirements (i.e., lawns that require everyday watering, shrubs that only require watering every other day, etc.). Therefore, the lawn stations can be assigned to a different program than the shrubs. With a single program timer, all stations would have to water on the same days.
Water seeps from one sprinkler. Is there something wrong with the sprinkler?
No. Water will drain through the lowest head until the pipe empties. If the seepage does not stop, the problem is with the valve that controls that sprinkler zone. The problem could be as simple as a small piece of debris inside the valve. Warning: Shut off the water supply before disassembling the valve. 
One zone continues to water after the cycle is complete. Is the controller broken?
Probably not, but to make sure, pull the power cord from the wall, removing power from the controller. If the water continues to run, the problem is with the zone valve. If the water stops, the controller is at fault. Double-check the programming.

Residential FAQs            











Blowers/Vacs
General Questions

            How do I obtain a replacement Owner's Manual or Parts Catalog?
        



To request or download a replacement Owner's Manual or Parts Manual, you will need the model and serial number of your unit. 




            Does the extension cord come with the blower?
        



An extension cord is not included with the 120VAC yard tool products. Outdoor-rated extension cords of various lengths and sizes are available through your local hardware or home center retailer. Refer to the product operator's manual for appropriate extension cord length and size recommendations.




            What type of extension cord should I use for my blower?
        



                    Extension cord: Ensure that your extension cord is in good condition. When using an extension cord, use one heavy enough to carry the current your product will draw. An undersized extension cord will cause a drop in line voltage resulting in loss of power and overheating.

See your operator's manual for the proper gauge and length of extension cord.

To reduce the risk of disconnection of the extension cord during use, connect the extension cord to the machine as illustrated in the Operation section of your Operator's Manual or our Interactive Product Manuals.
                



            Where can I purchase parts for my blower?
        



To purchase parts:
Our parts are retailed exclusively through a worldwide network of independent dealers, home centers, and national retailers. Parts are available for our electrical products through our online store at www.torodealer.com 
To purchase parts that are not available thorugh our www.Torodealer.com, please use our online dealer locator to find your nearest Toro Authorized Service Dealer.




            Is there a gutter attachment available for my blower?
        



                    The Toro Company does not offer a gutter cleaning attachment for our blower/vacs.




            Where can I find a part number?
        



You can obtain parts and accessories information for your Toro product by clicking on the "Parts" tab on the top of this page.

You will need your model and serial number to accurately locate your model. Our Product Center section can also can help you determine your model and serial number information if you do not know it.
                



            Battery Care and Information

General Maintenance

            What if my blower/vac will not start
        



                    If your blower fails to run when you turn it on, consult the following list before contacting your Authorized Service Dealer:

Ensure that the bottom inlet cover or vacuum tube is locked in place.
Verify the safety tab is not damaged on the inlet cover or the vacuum tube. 
Ensure that the power cord is secured in place on the back of the blower and that the plug is fully seated.

For further details consult your Owner's Manual. 








            How do I keep the power cord from disconnecting?
        



                    You can prevent your power cord from disconnecting by:


Take your extension cord & fold it over near the head of the plug. Tie a knot to relieve the tension on the connection point of the extension cord.
Feed the top of the cord through the cord through the rear opening of the blower unit.
Thread the loop of the cord around the rear hook of the blower unit.
Plug the receptacle of the AC cord onto the prongs of the blower unit, located above the rear hook. The cord lock feature will prevent the AC plug from being pulled out during use.

For further details consult your Owner's Manual or view Toro's online interactive product manuals by selecting your product below:


Power Sweep 51586 or 51585
Rake and Vac 51573
Superblower/Vac 51553
Superblower/Vac 51587, 51574 or 51617
Superblower/Vac 51591, 51602 or 51618
Ultra 225 Electric Blower/Vac 51598,51609 or 51619





            How do I safely remove clogged debris?
        



Steps to remove debris:

Unplug power cord from the unit.
Remove the vacuum tube.
Use a stick to pry any debris from the IMPELLER BLADES.
Inspect the IMPELLER BLADES for any signs of damage.
If the IMPELLER BLADE is damaged contact you Authorized Toro Dealer.

For further details consult your Owner's Manual. 








            How can I prevent the bag from wearing out?
        




Verify that the shoulder strap has been adjusted correctly to prevent the bag from dragging on the ground.
Make sure that the bag is not dragging on the ground when in use.  This will cause the bag to wear down and possibly cause problems with the zipper when opening and closing.
If the bag is damaged you can contact your local Toro Authorized Service Dealer or visit our online store at  www.torodealer.com

General Questions

            How do I find an authorized Toro dealer?
        



Authorized Service Dealer - Not comfortable doing the maintenance yourself?  Contact your Toro authorized service dealer for assistance.  To locate a dealer near you, please use our dealer locator online at www.toro.com/dealer or call us at 866-946-3119.




            What information should I have ready when contacting my dealer?
        




Model and serial number of the machine
Your proof of purchase receipt (for warranty inquiries)

Due to the wide variety of Toro products, the dealer will need the model and serial number to identify the machine and locate the appropriate parts. Should you require warranty service, the dealer will ask you for your proof of purchase to confirm your warranty status.




            What should I do before I start the mower?
        



                    Read the operator's manual prior to first use (review as needed)

Remove debris from the yard
Check the oil level
Use fresh fuel 
Follow all safety recommendations





            What if my machine won't start?
        



                    Some of the most common reasons a mower may not start are listed below:

Fresh fuel (less than 30 days old).
Starting will be easier if the spark plug in good condition. If in doubt, replace it. A new spark plug will be able to provide a better spark to ignite the fuel air mix within the engine. You should also make sure the spark plug wire is attached to the spark plug.
A clean air filter helps make it easier to start your machine. A dirty filter will make it much more difficult for the engine to draw in air. Clean or replace the filter if it is dirty. A clean filter will also help keep dust out of the engine and reduce wear.
On electric start models the battery should be charged at the beginning and end of the season. One charge may be enough to last through the whole season. If not, additional charging during the season may be necessary. Important: You can not start the mower with the electric start or charge the battery unless you install the fuse.
Review the starting procedures outlined in the Operator's Manual including the proper operation of the safety features of your unit.

For further assistance, please visit our online interactive manual for our Trouble Shooting Guide for Starting Your Mower or contact your local Toro Authorized Service Dealer.






            Why won't the TimeMaster mower turn off when I press the toggle switch?
        



                    When pressing the toggle switch in the Stop position, securely hold the toggle switch down until the engine stops (this can take a few seconds).
                



            How do I obtain a replacement Owner's Manual or Parts Manual?
        



To request or download a replacement Owner's Manual, Service Manuals or Parts Manual, you will need the model and serial number of your unit. 




            What should I do to prepare my machine for the mowing season?
        



Note: See your Operator's Manual for further details on performing any of the maintenance mentioned, and please pay special attention to the safety warnings when following these procedures.

Check blades for sharpness.
Make sure the cutting deck is cleared of old clippings.
Check pull cords to insure they are not frayed and are in good working condition.
Check that attachments are connected and working properly.





            How do I change the oil in my mower?
        



For Recycler® and Super Recycler® mowers:

Recommended Oil type for Toro Walk Behind Mowers, 4-Cycle engines - SAE 30W Detergent oil with an API service classification of SF, SG, SH, SJ, SL, or higher. 

Run the engine for five minutes to warm the oil so it drains better. (Recommend only filling fuel tank with enough gas to run for five minutes before changing oil.)
Remove the dipstick.
Tip the mower onto its side (air filter side up) to drain the used oil out through the oil fill tube into a drain pan. (Tipping the machine on its side is the recommended method by engine manufacturers.)
Let oil drain completely.
Tip the mower back up on its wheels and slowly pour new oil into the oil fill tube until oil level reaches the FULL line on the dipstick.  (To properly check the oil level , wait one or two minutes after filling the engine with oil to allow it to settle.  Wipe the dipstick clean, reinsert dipstick, remove dipstick and check oil level, repeat the process a second time.)
Important Do Not overfill - If you overfill the engine with oil you will need to remove the excess oil by following the oil draining  steps listed above.   Too much oil can cause engine damage or failure. 

For complete step-by-step instructions, please consult your Owner's Manual




            How do I store the battery on my mower?
        



Battery Storage

For any battery used on our products, we recommend storing it in a cool dry place. Removing the battery is not necessary. Storing it in a heated or warm area during the winter will actually shorten the battery's life. The best thing to do is to make sure it is fully charged at the end of each season, then store the product away in a cool (or cold) dry place.

The story behind batteries:

Batteries self-discharge due to a chemical reaction. The warmer the battery, the faster the reaction, resulting in greater loss. A loss of 1-2% per day in warm temperatures is normal. Storing a battery in a cool or cold area will greatly slow this reaction.  A fully charged battery will not freeze during the winter. A discharged battery may freeze. Freezing a battery usually damages it to the point of failure. Fully charge the battery in the fall and it will not freeze. 
When a battery is stored in a discharged state or allowed to discharge completely while in storage, a process called "sulfation" occurs. Sulfation also occurs normally with batteries while they are in use, but at a very slow rate - eventually this process is one of the things that contribute to a battery "going bad". Think of sulfation as an aging process. Some sulfation can be reversed when the battery is charged, but not all. Batteries left in a discharged state will sulfate heavily - the consequence of this is a loss of battery capacity (the battery runs down quicker).  Eventually, the battery can become so sulfated there is not enough capacity left to crank the engine at all.

Battery Life
If the battery is well cared for it will typically last 3-5 years. In a battery powered product good care means charging the product fully, immediately after each use.Battery powered mowers are to be left plugged in between uses. Leaving a machine with a partially or completely discharged battery is one of the worst things you can do for battery life.

Memory
This is not applicable to the batteries used in any of our Toro products.




            How long is my warranty and what does it cover?
        



                    For detailed information regarding your mowers warranty coverage, please refer to the last page in your owner's manual. To request or view an Owner's Manual, click here. 




            Is the electric start option available for my recoil start mower?
        



                    The Toro Company does not make an electric starter kit for Toro walk power mowers available. Attempts to convert a recoil start mower to accept such a system would involve costly engine modifications that are not recommended.

            What is the GTS® (Guaranteed to Start) warranty?
        



The Toro Company guarantees that any Toro GTS® engine will start on the first or second pull during the GTS® warranty period if you provide the routine maintenance it requires or we will fix it for free.  Consult your Owner's Manual  for the complete details on your machines warranty.
(Note: This only applies to starting the unit with the recoil rope on the first or second pull, not by the electric starter.) 

This starting guarantee varies from 2 to 5 years and is offered on select snowthrowers and walk power mowers.
To keep this GTS® warranty in effect you must maintain your Toro GTS® engine, at your expense, by following the maintenance schedule detailed in the operator's manual.

            What type of fuel oil do I use in my mower?
        



4 - Cycle Oil Recommendations:
Recommended Oil type (4-Cycle Engines)  -  Detergent oil with an API service classification of SF, SG, SH, SJ, SL, or higher. Due to various types of oil on our mowers we recommend getting this information from the operator's manual. You will need the model and serial number of your machine to view or download the appropriate manual.
Where do I find the model serial number?
Synthetic Engine Oil:

Yes, synthetic oil can be used in any of our machines after the first oil change and 5 hours of use.
Easier to start in cold weather (pertains to snowthorwers and tractors)
Due to size of the engine, the benefit of synthetic oil is minimal

Fuel and Engine Oil Ratios for 2-cycle:
Recommended Oil Type (2-Cycle Engine) - Toro 2-Cycle or NMMA-TCW3 equivalent.  Oil can be purchased from and Authorized Service Dealer or hardware store.
Review your machine's operators manual to determine the correct ratio.

16 to 1 = 8 oz. two cycle oil per one gallon fuel
32 to 1 = 4 oz. two cycle oil per one gallon fuel
50 to 1 = 2.6 oz. two cycle oil per one gallon fuel  

Two Cycle Engine Oil and Brand:
We recommend using Toro oil. Toro oil meets all our engineer requirements and is the only oil we use when testing out products. (NMMA TCW III rated oil is acceptable to use if not Toro oil is available to the customer.)
To locate a dealer near you, visit us at www.toro.com/dealer or by phone at 866-946-3119. 
Type of Fuel:
Unleaded gasoline with an octane rating of at least 87 ((R+M)/2 rating method) is the recommended fuel grade for all gasoline engines in Toro products. Gasoline with up to 10% ethanol (gasohol) or 15% MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) by volume is acceptable.

Only purchase what you expect to use within 30 days, or add stabilizer. Fuel stabilizer is available from most Toro dealers.
Ethanol Fuel:
Gasoline with up to 10% ethanol is acceptable to use per engine manufacturers guidelines.

Do not use gasoline containing methanol.

For further information about choosing the correct fuel for your machine:www.lookbeforeyoupump.com 
Fresh Fuel:
Fresh fuel (less than 30 days old). Gasoline starts deteriorating over time and fresh fuel ignites more easily. Old gas can leave harmful deposits in your products fuel system. 
Today's gasoline does not have the same chemical make-up as years ago. Testing has shown that significant deterioration can begin in as little as 30 days. The first sign of old gas is it makes starting more difficult. This is because the most volatile components of the fuel are the first to deteriorate and are the ones that help an engine start easily. 
Fuel Stabilizer:
Fuel stabilizer is designed to help keep the fuel fresher longer. It has to be added the day the fuel is purchased otherwise it will not do the job. It will not make old fuel fresh again. (Please follow the manufacturer’s instructions of the Stabilizer for the amount and how to add to the fuel) 

For information regarding Toro Premium Fuel Treatment, click here: 

To purchase one 4oz bottle of “Toro Premium Stabilizer”, order part number 117-0089, please visit www.torodealer.com or an authorized Toro dealer.

Fuel Containers:

            Why do I get noise from my transmission?
        



                    The noise is not from the transmission, but rather, is coming from the belt tapping the deck. This noise is an inherent part of mower operation, and does no harm to your Toro mower.
                



            Why do the wheels lock up when pulling back my rear wheel drive self-propel mower?
        



21" Super Recycler Mowers:

The design of the Toro rocking key wheel engagement system requires two things to occur prior to disengaging. 

The first requirement is for the drive belt to become slack.



For Personal Pace models, the operator simply needs to stop walking and allow the handle to move rearward. The rearward position removes all tension from the engagement cable and the belt becomes slack.




For single- or three-speed transmissions, the bail must be released to remove tension on the drive cable. 



The second requirement involves the mower rolling forward a few inches with the belt slack.



The mower must roll forward a few inches with the belt slack.



During normal operation on fairly level turf, this process should happen without effort.



Also, if your mower's drive cable is not adjusted correctly, the keys will not disengage without extra effort (see your Operator's Manual for applicable drive cable adjustment procedures).




Another cause of this difficulty is too much or too little grease in the rear pivot arms.



22" Recycler Mowers:

Note: There will be some slight resistance when the mower is pulled backwards compared to when the mower is pushed forwards.   

Possible causes of the mower rear wheels locking up or skidding when the unit is pulled backwards are:



The traction/drive cable is kinked (Replace cable)




Debris is caught or built up near the belt guide (See your Owner's Manual  for proper maintenance procedures)




The transmission has failed. (Contact an  Authorized Service Dealer)

            Why don't I have a throttle control on my mower?
        



                    Most Walk Power Mowers we offer do not have a throttle control. A throttle control would allow you to vary the engine speed from idle all the way up to full speed. We have found, not having it actually increases engine life and product performance. 

Here are some of the reasons full throttle operation is best:

Cleaner cut on the grass 
More power, less likely to bog down 
Less stress on the engine 
Engine runs cooler (Full speed means more cooling air from the flywheel area) 
Slow engine speeds can result in hot spots on the cylinder 

On units with throttle control we recommend full throttle operation while in use. Throttling down for a minute to talk to the neighbor is fine but that’s about the only time. 



General Maintenance

            What is the recommended maintenance schedule for my mower? 
        



                    Maintenance schedules vary by model. We recommend that you consult your Toro owner's manual. To request or view an Owner's Manual, click here.

            How do I change the oil in my mower? 
        



For Recycler® and Super Recycler® mowers:
Recommended Oil type for Toro Walk Behind Mowers, 4-Cycle engines - SAE 30W Detergent oil with an API service classification of SF, SG, SH, SJ, SL, or higher. 

Run the engine for five minutes to warm the oil so it drains better. (Recommend only filling fuel tank with enough gas to run for five minutes before changing oil.)
Remove the dipstick.
Tip the mower onto its side (air filter side up) to drain the used oil out through the oil fill tube into a drain pan. (Tipping the machine on its side is the recommended method by engine manufacturers.)
Let oil drain completely.
Tip the mower back up on its wheels and slowly pour new oil into the oil fill tube until oil level reaches the FULL line on the dipstick.  (To properly check the oil level , wait one or two minutes after filling the engine with oil to allow it to settle.  Wipe the dipstick clean, reinsert dipstick, remove dipstick and check oil level, repeat the process a second time.)
Important Do Not overfill - If you overfill the engine with oil you will need to remove the excess oil by following the oil draining  steps listed above.   Too much oil can cause engine damage or failure.

            How do I maintain the piston and cylinder in my 2-Cycle or 4-cycle engine?
        



4-Cycle Engines (Oil and Gas Separate):

Remove spark plug and add about one tablespoon of oil through spark plug hole.
Slowly rotate engine several times using starter rope or key starter to distribute oil. Reinstall spark plug, but do not connect spark plug wire.

2-Cycle Engines (Oil and Gas Mixture):

Slowly pull recoil starter until resistance is felt due to compression pressure, then stop.
Release starter tension slowly to prevent engine from reversing due to compression pressure.
This position closes both the intake and exhaust ports to prevent outside air entry, which can result in corrosion of the cylinder bore.

            When do I need to sharpen or replace the blades?
        



                    With normal residential use of a mower, we recommend replacing or sharpening the blade yearly. However, blades should be checked after each tank of gas is used for nicks, damage, or dull edges.

Blades are sharp! Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them. Use caution and review your operator’s manual for specific details before replacing the blade(s).
Note: New blades are pre-sharpened.

Cutting/Mulching/Bagging

            How do I get the best quality of cut? 
        



To obtain the best quality of cut:

Make sure the blade is sharp (for best results, replace or sharpen yearly or when needed).
Operate the machine at full throttle.
Cut only 1/3 of the grass blade at a time.
Mow only dry grass or leaves.

If the finished lawn appearance is unsatisfactory, try one or more of the following:

Walk at slower pace while mowing.
Raise the cutting height on your mower.
Cut the grass more frequently
Overlap the cutting swaths instead of cutting a full swath with each pass.
Set the cutting height on the front wheels one notch lower than the rear wheels. (For example, set the front wheels at 2 inches and the rear wheels at 2 3/8 inches.)
Alternate mowing direction to keep the grass standing straight - this helps disperse clippings, which enhances decomposition and fertilization.
Clean the clippings and dirt from the underside of the mower after each use. (Grass build up inside the mower will affect cutting quality.)

For additional tips, view our online interactive manual for more information on obtaining the best quality of cut.




            Why does dirt get trapped in the grass bag? 
        



                    The rear of the grass bag is two layers thick to stop any foreign objects that the mower might pick up. However, some dirt and sand will go through the first layer. This is why we have intentionally left one side of the inner layer unsewn - leaving one side of this layer open allows the dirt to fall out when the bag is emptied.
                



            How do I properly bag the grass? 
        



We have heard reports of clippings leaking from the sides of the bag.  In the upper corners of the bag, there is a small plastic flap that will close off any gaps. When installed correctly, air pressure pushes the flap out to the frame and closes off the opening.

If the bag is assembled with the flap on the outside, the air pressure will blow the flap open and clippings can escape. The flap is large enough so that if installed inside it will stay there. Simply push the flap inside the frame.

Why does the grass fall out of the bag?

If the bag is improperly mounted the hooks will not properly engage the mower. This bag should NOT rest on the handle cross bar. If it does the bottom of the bag will not fill up to the chassis and grass will fall out.
When the bag is properly mounted it sets below the handle cross bar and will fit up to the mower housing correctly
Bag frame may be bent.  (See your local Authorized Service Dealer for assistance)





            Is a bagger attachment available for my mower? 
        



                    With only a few exceptions, an optional bagger attachment is available for your mower. For availability and pricing information, please contact your local Authorized Service Dealer.



e-Cycler Cordless Mower

            What is the best way to store the eCycler mower for the off-season?
        



Toro designed the mower to mulch grass when the mulch door is completely closed.  For the best cutting results and lawn appearance, follow these instructions whether cutting grass or leaves.

Maintain a sharp blade throughout the cutting season. 
Only mow dry grass or leaves.  Wet grass or leaves tend to clump on the yard and may cause the mower to plug up or the motor to stall.
Clean the clippings or leaves from the underside of the mower deck after each mowing.  Use a wooden tool, not a metal one.
Do not cut below the 2 ½ inch setting unless the grass is sparse, or is late fall when grass growth begins to slow down.  When changing the cutting height from an established setting to a higher cutting height, the grass may appear ragged or uneven until the grass adjusts to the new established cutting height and regains its normal appearance.
Alternate the mowing direction.  This helps to disperse the clippings over the lawn for even fertilization.

If the finished cut lawn appearance is unsatisfactory, try one or more of the following:

Sharpen the blade.
Walk at a slower pace while mowing.
Raise the cutting height on your mower.
Cut the grass more frequently.
Overlap cutting swaths instead of cutting a full swath with each pass.
Set the cutting height on the front wheels one notch lower than that of the rear wheels.  For example, set the front wheels at 2 ½ inch setting and the rear wheels at 3 inch setting.





            How can I optimize the battery run time of my mower? 
        



With the battery-powered mower, the conditions of the grass and the way that you mow will effect how long the battery will run on a single charge at each mowing.
The following are some things that will affect the battery run time:

Moisture content of the grass – The more moisture there is in the grass, the faster the battery will run down.
Walking/mowing speed – the faster you walk, the faster the battery will run down.
Mode of operation – Mulching the grass requires the most battery energy.  Bagging requires the second highest amount of battery energy and side discharging uses the least.
Cutting height - If the battery is running down too fast, raise the cutting height one notch.





            How do I clean the mower housing on the e-Cycler? 
        



Before cleaning the mower, stop the motor, wait for all moving parts to stop, and remove the key from the plug receptacle.
NOTICE!  Do not spray or pour water in the mower when cleaning.  Moisture can get trapped in the mower and cause corrosion of internal parts.
Cleaning after Each Use

Clean the underside of the mower housing. Be particularly careful to keep the front cavity clear of all grass clippings and debris. Remove dirt and grass clippings with a hardwood scraper. Avoid burrs and sharp edges.


Brush all grass clippings and debris off the top of the mower housing after every use.

Cleaning after Each Season

Remove the top shroud and clean out any grass clippings and debris from underneath it and around the battery with compressed air, a vacuum cleaner, or a brush.

NOTICE!  Do not use metal objects to clean around the battery.  If metal objects contact the positive and negative posts at the same time, this may short out the battery.  The battery or the conductor may overheat and cause burns.

Check for any discoloration or charred wires and battery and switch contacts.  If any are damaged, contact an Authorized Service Dealer for repair.





            How do I reset the circuit breaker on the mower? 
        



If the mower is run under too much load, the circuit breaker will trip.  Follow these instructions to reset the circuit breaker.
NOTICE!  Never reset the circuit breaker when the key is in the receptacle and the control lever is squeezed to the handle.

Remove the key from the receptacle.
Wait 30 seconds, and then push in the circuit breaker button.
Install the key in the plug receptacle.
Resume cutting under a lighter load.

Note:   If the circuit breaker repeatedly trips, raise the cutting height, use the grass bag, use the optional side discharge cute, or clean under the deck.




            Does the charger cord stay attached to the mower while mowing? 
        



                    The battery charger is only needed to recharge the battery.  It is not used for mowing with the mower.




            How do I know when the battery is fully charged? 
        



Your battery charger has a two-color LED display that indicates the following states of charging:

A red light indicates that the charger is charging the battery.
A green light indicates that the battery is fully charged; the charger is trickle-charging the battery to maintain the battery charge.

NOTICE!  This mower has a battery charger that checks the charge state of the battery only when necessary.  Toro recommends that you unplug the charger from the wall outlet after 24 hours of charging, though you may leave the charger plugged into the mower longer without harming the system.  During the non-mowing season, you can unplug and store the mower for up to three months if the battery is fully charged and the mower is stored in a cold, dry place.




            How can I get the best performance out of the mower battery? 
        



NOTICE!  For best performance, use only a Toro 36 –volt charger (part no. 119-0269).
It takes approximately 16 hours to charge a fully discharged battery.  Fully charge the battery before the first mowing of the season, after every use, and before off-season storage.  Failing to charge the battery after every use shortens the battery life.  Charge the battery even if you run the mower only a few minutes.
Note:  The battery is charged at the factory.  However, before using the mower for the first time, charge the battery and ensure that it has a full charge before operating.

            How do I maintain the piston and cylinder in my 2-cycle or 4-cycle engine for off season storage?
        



4-Cycle Engines (Oil and Gas Separate):

Remove spark plug and add about one tablespoon of oil through spark plug hole.
Slowly rotate engine several times using starter rope or key starter to distribute oil.
Reinstall spark plug, but do not connect spark plug wire.

2-Cycle Engines (Oil and Gas Mixture):

Slowly pull recoil starter until resistance is felt due to compression pressure, then stop.
Release starter tension slowly to prevent engine from reversing due to compression pressure. This position closes both the intake and exhaust ports to prevent outside air entry, which can result in corrosion of the cylinder bore.

Miscellaneous


Lubricate/grease the machine per the Operator's Manual. Touch up all rusted or chipped paint surfaces. Replace Damaged or Worn Parts.
Single Stage
Inspect paddles and scrapers for wear. If the machine does not self-propel these parts are most likely worn and due for replacement. Look for the wear mark on the paddle(s)
2-Stage
Inspect belts and replace if frayed or cracked. Check adjustment of skid shoes; replace if worn out. Lubricate machine per the operator's manual.
All Snowthrowers:
Tighten screws, bolts and nuts as needed. Repair or replace damaged parts. Clean it thoroughly.
Storage
Allow engine to cool for an hour, out of the reach of children. Cover machine and store in a clean, dry location.
Please Note: Never store machine in house (living area) or basement where ignition sources may be present such as a hot water heater, space heater, clothes dryer and the like because gasoline and fumes are highly flammable, explosive and dangerous if inhaled.






            How do I properly add fuel stabilizer to my engine before I store it?
        




Remove old fuel. Add fuel stabilizer/conditioner to the fuel container.
Run engine for five minutes to distribute new conditioned fuel through fuel system.
Stop engine, allow it to cool, and drain fuel tank or run engine until it stops.
Restart the engine again and allow it to run until it stops.
Either choke or prime the engine, restart it a third time and allow it to run until it stops.
Continue to attempt to restart the engine until it will no longer start.







            How can I prevent the snow from clogging up the snowthrower?
        



**CAUTION If you leave the wire on the spark plug, someone could accidentally start the engine and seriously injure you or other bystanders.
Disconnect the wire from the spark plug before you do any maintenance.  Set the wires aside so that it does not accidentally contact the spark plug.  **
If the auger area gets clogged consult your Owner's Manual for the detailed cleaning procedures.  Never put your hands in the auger area.  Use a stick to clear out the snow. 

Paint any bare surfaces.  This will prevent rust and keep the surface smooth.
If machine was stored in area warmer than the outdoor temperature, allow the snowthrower to cool down for 20 to 30 minutes outdoors.
Verify that the snowthrower is being run at full throttle.
If snow is extremely wet and heavy, take less than a full pass at a time.





            How do I prepare my snowthrower for winter?
        



                    Now is a great time to take your machine to a local dealer for any needed maintenance or repairs. Once snow falls their shop will be extremely busy and they will most likely have long delays. To locate an Authorized Service Dealer near you click here.

If you would like an operator's manual and/or parts list, they can be downloaded for no charge from the Solution Center under the  Product Center tab. 

If you're planning to do your own maintenance, or just want to see what we recommend, please follow these tips which will help ensure you snowthrower is ready for winter. Please see your operator's manual for further details on performing any of the maintenance mentioned.

Fresh fuel (less than 30 days old). Gasoline starts deteriorating over time and fresh fuel ignites more easily. Old fuel can leave harmful deposits in you product's fuel system.
Today's gasoline does not have the same chemical make up as years ago. Testing has shown that significant deterioration can begin in as little as 30 days. The first sign of old gas is it makes starting more difficult. This is because the most volatile components of the fuel are the first to deteriorate and the ones that help an engine start easily.
Fuel Stabilizer: 
Fuel stabilizer is designed to help keep the fuel fresher longer. It has to be added the day the fuel is purchased otherwise it will not do the job. It will not make old fuel fresh again. (Please follow the manufacturer’s instructions of the Stabilizer for the amount and how to add to the fuel) 
For information regarding Toro Premium Fuel Treatment, click here 
It's also a good idea to wait until the cool fall weather season arrives before purchasing gasoline for your machine. Gasoline is re-blended to suit the season, and although the difference isn't as great as it once was, winter grade fuel will make cold weather starts easier.
Starting will be easier if the spark plug is in good condition. If in doubt, replace it. A new spark plug will be able to better ignite the fuel air mixture within the engine. You should also make sure the spark plug wire securely attaches to the spark plug.
If you have a 4-cycle model (fuel and oil are separate) and didn't change the oil last spring, now is the time. Even if you only run the machine a few hours a year, the oil should be changed. Oil in a small engine does not break down very fast; however, it does become contaminated. Moisture from the air and small amounts of combustion byproducts (exhaust) will build up in the oil within a very short time. This contamination will result in increased wear and can even eat away at internal parts over time. Following the recommended schedule for your machine can help prevent expensive repairs.
Review the starting procedures outlined in the operator's manual including the proper operation of the safety features on your machine.





            Why is the snow being discharged poorly from the snowthrower?
        



CAUTION : If you leave the wire on the spark plug, someone could accidentally start the engine and seriously injure you or other bystanders.
Disconnect the wire from the spark plug before you do any maintenance.  Set the wires aside so that it does not accidentally contact the spark plug. 

Make sure the snowthrower is running at Full Throttle.
Have an Authorized Service Dealer check the RPM's on the snowthrower.
Verify that all the belts are adjusted properly.  For further details consult your Owner's Manual.
In extremely heavy and wet snow conditions, take a smaller pass or wait until the temperature and snow conditions change.





            What type of fuel do I use in my machine?
        



Click here to visit our Fuel Facts page
Type of Fuel:

All Models: For best results, your battery should be charged in a location where the temperature is more than 41 degrees F but less than 104 degrees F.
The battery pack is not fully charged when it is purchased. Before using the trimmer for the first time, place the battery pack in the charger, ensure battery is securely attached (it will click) into charger and charge until the LED indicators turn green.
Model 51467 8” Cordless:
Charge the battery for 24 hours or until the charge light on the charger is green before the first use and after each use thereafter.
Important: Always charge the battery after each use. Storing the unit with a discharged battery will reduce the life of your battery. This lead-acid battery has no memory.
The charge light is red while the battery is charging; it turns green when the battery is fully charged or when the trimmer is not connected. Charge the battery for 24 hours or until the charge light turns green.
Model 51487 24 Volt 12” Cordless and 51484 20 Volt 12” cordless
The battery pack is not fully charged when it is purchased. Before using the trimmer for the first time, place the battery pack in the charger, ensure battery is securely attached (it will click) into charger and charge until the LED indicators turn green.
Using the battery when it is hot can reduce the operating time. The battery will automatically stop working when it is overheated to prevent damage to it. Remove the battery from the charger
Model 51488 48 Volt 13” Cordless:
The battery pack is not fully charged when it is purchased. Before using the trimmer for the first time, place the battery pack in the charger and charge until the LED indicators turn green.
Storage:
Storing a lithium-ion battery at 40% of its capacity maximizes battery life.
Use storage mode when the battery will not be used for 1 month or longer.

Insert the battery into the charger.
Turn storage mode on.
The battery will charge or discharge as necessary to approximately 40% charge.
When the battery is ready for storage, remove the battery from the charger.

Using the battery when it is hot can reduce the operating time. The battery will automatically stop working when it is overheated to prevent damage to it.



Cordless Trimmer

            What kind of maintenance needs to be done to my cordless trimmer?
        



                    After each use of the trimmer, complete the following procedures:

Wipe the trimmer clean with a damp cloth. Do not hose the trimmer down or submerse it in water
Wipe or scrape clean the cutter head and spool area any time there is an accumulation of dirt or cuttings
Check and tighten all fasteners. If any part is damaged or lost, repair or replace it
Scrape debris away from air intake vents

Important:  Keep the air intake vents free of grass and debris to prevent the motor from overheating. 




            How do I replace the line or spool?
        



See product operator's manual for instructions. For replacement line, you can purchase either a new, pre-wound spool of line (model no. 88185 or 88045) or bulk line (0.065 inch dia. x 10ft.) that you can wind onto the old spool. Both are available from your Authorized Toro Dealer or visit online www.torodealer.com
Removing the spool:

Remove the cap and spool. (Note: If spring falls out, install spring before replacing spool and cap.)
Clean the cutting head and cap. Inspect them for any damage or worn parts.

Rewinding the spool: (Note: If you are replacing the spool with a new, pre-wound spool, discard the empty spool and skip this section.)

Remove any cutting line left on the spool.
Hook one end of the line all the way into the slot on the spool, allowing no more than 1/8 inch to (3mm) to protrude.
Wind the line in the direction of the arrow on the spool, in level rows, between the spool flanges. (Note: The trimmer will not function correctly if you wind the line in the wrong direction, the end of the line protrudes more than 1/8 inch or you wind more than 30 ft of line on the spool.

Installing the Spool:

Unwind no more than three inches of the line from spool (either new or re-wound).
Holding the line and spool to prevent unravelling, place the cap over the spool.
Insert the line into the eyelet, aligning the cap tabs and with the slots in the cutter head.
Re-install cap and lock in place.

Note: If the line should tangle or break at the eyelet, stop the trimmer, remove the spool as described above, feed the line through the eyelet, and reassemble the spool to the cutting head.
For further details consult your Owner's Manual.



Electric Trimmer

            What kind of maintenance needs to be done to my electric trimmer?
        



                    After each use of the trimmer, complete the following procedures:

Wipe the trimmer clean with a damp cloth. Do not hose the trimmer down or submerse it in water
Wipe or scrape clean the cutter head and spool area any time there is an accumulation of dirt or cuttings
Check and tighten all fasteners. If any part is damaged or lost, repair or replace it
Scrape debris away from air intake vents on the back of the shaft.

Important:  Keep the air intake vents free of grass and debris to prevent the motor from overheating 




            How do I keep the power cord from disconnecting?
        



Important:  Check the power cord frequently during use for holes in the insulation. Do not use a damaged cord. Do not run the cord through standing water or wet grass. Do not allow the trimmer to cut into the cord.


Create a loophole with the cord near the plug.
Slide the loophole section of the cord through the rear hole of the trimmer's handle.
Allow the loophole of the cord to slip over the hook located inside the trimmer's handle.
Plug the cord into the rear of the trimmer's handle. The prongs are located within the receptacle.
Reduce any slack of the cord by pulling the longer end of the cord.

For further details consult your Owner's Manual.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
