“Nice place”


Reviewed 2 weeks ago




Positives: Pool was very nice and clean, very relaxing. Room was nice and clean as well (a little dated but was ok due to very well kept. Kind of had the old time country club feel). Staff was very nice and helpful: My watch went missing and the executive housekeeper and a manager came and searched my room and also checked dirty towels and linens. The watch did turn up in personal stuff (not sure how got in there) so all was good.Negative: Room walls pretty thin. A group of young men checked into the two bedroom next to us and we could hear them very clearly. Not sure if the walls or the adjoining door was the problem. But the staff was going to move us if we wanted to but we decided to gut it out for one last night.

Hello Mfoltz7, Thank you for your kind words about the pool. Everyone knows how frustrating it can be to be woken up by children. Thank you for letting us know the problem so that we had to opportunity to address it, even if you chose not to take us up on it. We hope you'll come back and see us!

“Old Property with poor customer service if there is a problem”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




We stayed at Saddlebrook over the fourth of July with our family and friends. Upon arrival we were taken by golf cart to our room (Nice touch). The property is very spread out and walking with luggage would be hard. We reserved a one bedroom suite. The suite was a good size but ridiculously outdated. It smelt musty, and the couch looked liked it had seen better days (sunken in). The food on property was OK, nothing special, seriously nothing I would recommend. Two things I would not recommend are the wings from room service (dry and tough) or the breakfast sandwich (mushy and tasteless). The girls at the pool activities kiosk were great, super friendly and nice. The spa was wonderful, I would recommend getting a treatment or two. What annoyed me the most about my stay was after I left and received my bill. I was overcharged $50 (for an early arrival) which I never requested. This seems to be an easiest enough mistake. It should go like this "I'm sorry, it will be taken care of, I will email you a new bill." This is how it actually went: I had to call FOUR times, each time explain the situation to someone new. When I actually spoke with a manager Tyler, and explained my exasperation with the situation he simply said "sorry, it was an easy mistake". I understand mistakes happen but its the way that they are handled that matters. I will not be returning to this resort.

Hello Elizabeth C, Let me start by saying I am glad you enjoyed the Spa. The ladies there work very hard. However I'm disappointed the rest of your stay was not as pleasant. Our staff should have handled your request to first time. You are right, excuses should not be made no matter how small the mistake. I'm sorry the rooms we're outdated, but we are currently renovating all of them now with a much fresher look. We hope you will come back to see them once they're finished and leave you with a different experience.

“Nice enough and good service”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




The resort is pleasant enough, with good service and a pretty good restaurant on site. The pools are nice and there's a separate pool that's a little more quiet (no children) if you want just an afternoon with sun and a cocktail. We enjoyed our stay.

“Felt like staying at a retirement community...”


Reviewed 4 weeks ago



via mobile




Employees are very nice but rooms are well below average. If you are looking for a place to golf, this may not be the right one for you. The greens were not well kept and neither was the entire Palmer Course. For those who may want to practice after 4, don't even think about it. Their cart barn guys are 70 plus years of age and close the course before 5:30. Yes, if you are older or like to turn in really early, this is great. But, for normal aged people, you may know it is ludicrous to close a course before 5:30. I had played a round early in the day and wanted to practice later around 5 PM. I had gone to get a cart, and they told me that the course was closed, so I asked them nicely if they could get me a cart so I could play the round I PAYED for. They were single minded and non-negotiable. Awful golfing experience. And not to mention, most of the resort was vacant, so it certainly felt like a ghost town. Also, everything screams 1980s it is quite awful to be frank.

Hello Bradh0230, I am sorry to hear we did not met your expectations. I do not intend to make excuses but I feel you are owed some explanation. In regards to the golf course, both courses were aerified this month which makes them bumpy. However, it is necessary to maintain their condition in the long run. As summer begins our grass transitions from one type to another, as the heat kills certain types of grass. Its part of the natural order but we have hired some of the best people to meet this challenge. The first couple weeks are always the hardest until the newer grass fills in. As for the courses closing early this is to give the grass sometime to heal since its a delicate time. I hope from this you can tell there is a goal and thought put into these decisions, and they are not made lightly. As for the rooms you maybe happy to know we are currently beginning renovation of them. If you choose to return again we will improve on your stay.

“Amazing service and attention to clients”


Reviewed June 22, 2017




We really loved our stay at Saddlebrook. The tennis program was excellent and all the tennis instructors were knowledgeable and paid great attention to the details of every individual's needs. We came with our kids and had them participate in the junior tennis camp while my wife participated in the adult program. The tennis instruction for the kids and adults were absolutely first rate. The hotel service was also fabulous. The rooms were immaculate and spacious while the service was always friendly. We are definitely coming back!

Hello Victoria D, I'm sorry to hear not everything was to you liking during your stay. I am surprised you thought the pool temperature was to cold. All of our pools are heated and we maintain temperatures in the mid 80's. I will discuss with our pool maintenance staff to ensure there haven't been any issues.

“Great Father's Day Weekend”


Reviewed June 19, 2017




Our family just returned from a first time weekend stay at Saddlebrook and had an amazing fun time. We specifically went to enjoy some family time by the pool and we were not disappointed in any way. The pool area is huge, well maintained and offers fantastic poolside F&B service with very friendly staff. The pool bar was a great escape from the sun too and we loved the poolside DJ on Saturday. While the accommodations are a little dated, they were very clean and comfortable and the grounds were beautiful. We enjoyed a very nice dinner in Dempsey's Steakhouse and again David our waiter was fantastic. We are already hoping to return in late summer.


Room Tip: You can get rooms with either pool views or golf views. Golf views may be a little quieter.

Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Copy URL above and paste away!Sherry R.10/16/2010OverallClassy, Royal TreatmentMy sister, mother and I love to come here. The pools are awesome and the scenery is wonderful. They have a small boardwalk that has it's own ecosystem of baby alligators and a variety of different Florida birds nesting all year round. It is quite a site! Bike ride, play tennis, pool volleyball, lounge and have drinks served to you by the pool and then have the best sleep you'll ever have in their wonderfully comfortable beds. It reminds me of a time share with the luxuries and service of a hotel and a side of being on a cruise; it's the ultimate resort.Helpful(0)ShareFlagzct161908/14/2006Provided by Citysearch - OverallSkip the scalp massageWhen I saw Scalp Massage on my Queen for a Day menu, I thought, ""How interesting!""  Now that I've experienced it, I can officially say, ""How awful!!!."" You lay back on a massage table and, ON DRY HAIR, your scalp masseuse drips about a bottle worth of aromatherapy all over your head. I never noticed how annoying the sound of dry hair being rubbed sounded. The scalp masseuse then told me to sit in the steam room for a bit so the oils could titillate my scalp.   It took three shampoos to get the oil of my hair and the steam room didnt help matters at all. Normally, you come home from the spa looking relaxed and renewed... all I can say was that it was pretty embarrassing walking through the resort and handing the valet my ticket, while I looked like a grease ball.Helpful(0)FlagMap & DirectionsPeople Also ViewedHibiscus Massage5260 Village Market, Wesley Chapel, FLSkin Renu Laser Spa2136 Ashley Oaks Cir, Wesley Chapel, FLP.StyleMe Hair Care Studio(3)Attitudes Total Body Image5416 Bruce B Downs Blvd, Wesley Chapel, FLEssentials Massage & Facials of Wesley Chapel2230 Ashley Oaks Cir, Wesley Chapel, FLPaid Advertisement

“Old Property with poor customer service if there is a problem”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




We stayed at Saddlebrook over the fourth of July with our family and friends. Upon arrival we were taken by golf cart to our room (Nice touch). The property is very spread out and walking with luggage would be hard. We reserved a one bedroom suite. The suite was a good size but ridiculously outdated. It smelt musty, and the couch looked liked it had seen better days (sunken in). The food on property was OK, nothing special, seriously nothing I would recommend. Two things I would not recommend are the wings from room service (dry and tough) or the breakfast sandwich (mushy and tasteless). The girls at the pool activities kiosk were great, super friendly and nice. The spa was wonderful, I would recommend getting a treatment or two. What annoyed me the most about my stay was after I left and received my bill. I was overcharged $50 (for an early arrival) which I never requested. This seems to be an easiest enough mistake. It should go like this "I'm sorry, it will be taken care of, I will email you a new bill." This is how it actually went: I had to call FOUR times, each time explain the situation to someone new. When I actually spoke with a manager Tyler, and explained my exasperation with the situation he simply said "sorry, it was an easy mistake". I understand mistakes happen but its the way that they are handled that matters. I will not be returning to this resort.

Hello Elizabeth C, Let me start by saying I am glad you enjoyed the Spa. The ladies there work very hard. However I'm disappointed the rest of your stay was not as pleasant. Our staff should have handled your request to first time. You are right, excuses should not be made no matter how small the mistake. I'm sorry the rooms we're outdated, but we are currently renovating all of them now with a much fresher look. We hope you will come back to see them once they're finished and leave you with a different experience.

“Nice enough and good service”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




The resort is pleasant enough, with good service and a pretty good restaurant on site. The pools are nice and there's a separate pool that's a little more quiet (no children) if you want just an afternoon with sun and a cocktail. We enjoyed our stay.

“Felt like staying at a retirement community...”


Reviewed 4 weeks ago



via mobile




Employees are very nice but rooms are well below average. If you are looking for a place to golf, this may not be the right one for you. The greens were not well kept and neither was the entire Palmer Course. For those who may want to practice after 4, don't even think about it. Their cart barn guys are 70 plus years of age and close the course before 5:30. Yes, if you are older or like to turn in really early, this is great. But, for normal aged people, you may know it is ludicrous to close a course before 5:30. I had played a round early in the day and wanted to practice later around 5 PM. I had gone to get a cart, and they told me that the course was closed, so I asked them nicely if they could get me a cart so I could play the round I PAYED for. They were single minded and non-negotiable. Awful golfing experience. And not to mention, most of the resort was vacant, so it certainly felt like a ghost town. Also, everything screams 1980s it is quite awful to be frank.

Hello Bradh0230, I am sorry to hear we did not met your expectations. I do not intend to make excuses but I feel you are owed some explanation. In regards to the golf course, both courses were aerified this month which makes them bumpy. However, it is necessary to maintain their condition in the long run. As summer begins our grass transitions from one type to another, as the heat kills certain types of grass. Its part of the natural order but we have hired some of the best people to meet this challenge. The first couple weeks are always the hardest until the newer grass fills in. As for the courses closing early this is to give the grass sometime to heal since its a delicate time. I hope from this you can tell there is a goal and thought put into these decisions, and they are not made lightly. As for the rooms you maybe happy to know we are currently beginning renovation of them. If you choose to return again we will improve on your stay.

“Amazing service and attention to clients”


Reviewed June 22, 2017




We really loved our stay at Saddlebrook. The tennis program was excellent and all the tennis instructors were knowledgeable and paid great attention to the details of every individual's needs. We came with our kids and had them participate in the junior tennis camp while my wife participated in the adult program. The tennis instruction for the kids and adults were absolutely first rate. The hotel service was also fabulous. The rooms were immaculate and spacious while the service was always friendly. We are definitely coming back!

Hello Victoria D, I'm sorry to hear not everything was to you liking during your stay. I am surprised you thought the pool temperature was to cold. All of our pools are heated and we maintain temperatures in the mid 80's. I will discuss with our pool maintenance staff to ensure there haven't been any issues.

“Great Father's Day Weekend”


Reviewed June 19, 2017




Our family just returned from a first time weekend stay at Saddlebrook and had an amazing fun time. We specifically went to enjoy some family time by the pool and we were not disappointed in any way. The pool area is huge, well maintained and offers fantastic poolside F&B service with very friendly staff. The pool bar was a great escape from the sun too and we loved the poolside DJ on Saturday. While the accommodations are a little dated, they were very clean and comfortable and the grounds were beautiful. We enjoyed a very nice dinner in Dempsey's Steakhouse and again David our waiter was fantastic. We are already hoping to return in late summer.


Room Tip: You can get rooms with either pool views or golf views. Golf views may be a little quieter.

“Another disappointing experience”


Reviewed June 14, 2017



via mobile




I reviewed Saddlebrook Resort last summer and was told that the dining experience in particular would be vastly improved after my review. In March 2017, I came with my school team for a training trip. We arrived at 6pm ish that evening and were brought to a white tent. When we went inside, we were told by the bored staff that all the food was gone and there was none left. After a long 4 hour flight, we were annoyed to say the least. We were forced to wait for 2 hours at TD's to be served and we had to pay extra. After this experience, they kept us in the tent, with food that was subpar compared even to the inside dining, which was noted in my review was not very good. Again, the tennis program was amazing, but the treatment of junior players must be improved at the resort. Once again I felt less than the regular guests. Very disappointed. Prob will not return.

“As Good As Ever”


Reviewed 1 week ago




After many years of coming to Saddlebrook we decided to bring my parents to celebrate their 75th and 70th birthdays.As ever Saddlebrook did not disappoint. The rooms were great and the resort was spotless. We played 3 days at the tennis camp and thanks to Howard Moore and his team we all had a good a time. Coaching staff were fantastic and such value for money. It really was the holiday of a lifetime. Very special memories


Room Tip: All rooms are good but we were in Cluster 8 which was very quiet

“Nice place”


Reviewed 2 weeks ago




Positives: Pool was very nice and clean, very relaxing. Room was nice and clean as well (a little dated but was ok due to very well kept. Kind of had the old time country club feel). Staff was very nice and helpful: My watch went missing and the executive housekeeper and a manager came and searched my room and also checked dirty towels and linens. The watch did turn up in personal stuff (not sure how got in there) so all was good.Negative: Room walls pretty thin. A group of young men checked into the two bedroom next to us and we could hear them very clearly. Not sure if the walls or the adjoining door was the problem. But the staff was going to move us if we wanted to but we decided to gut it out for one last night.

“Old Property with poor customer service if there is a problem”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




We stayed at Saddlebrook over the fourth of July with our family and friends. Upon arrival we were taken by golf cart to our room (Nice touch). The property is very spread out and walking with luggage would be hard. We reserved a one bedroom suite. The suite was a good size but ridiculously outdated. It smelt musty, and the couch looked liked it had seen better days (sunken in). The food on property was OK, nothing special, seriously nothing I would recommend. Two things I would not recommend are the wings from room service (dry and tough) or the breakfast sandwich (mushy and tasteless). The girls at the pool activities kiosk were great, super friendly and nice. The spa was wonderful, I would recommend getting a treatment or two. What annoyed me the most about my stay was after I left and received my bill. I was overcharged $50 (for an early arrival) which I never requested. This seems to be an easiest enough mistake. It should go like this "I'm sorry, it will be taken care of, I will email you a new bill." This is how it actually went: I had to call FOUR times, each time explain the situation to someone new. When I actually spoke with a manager Tyler, and explained my exasperation with the situation he simply said "sorry, it was an easy mistake". I understand mistakes happen but its the way that they are handled that matters. I will not be returning to this resort.

Hello Elizabeth C, Let me start by saying I am glad you enjoyed the Spa. The ladies there work very hard. However I'm disappointed the rest of your stay was not as pleasant. Our staff should have handled your request to first time. You are right, excuses should not be made no matter how small the mistake. I'm sorry the rooms we're outdated, but we are currently renovating all of them now with a much fresher look. We hope you will come back to see them once they're finished and leave you with a different experience.

“Nice enough and good service”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




The resort is pleasant enough, with good service and a pretty good restaurant on site. The pools are nice and there's a separate pool that's a little more quiet (no children) if you want just an afternoon with sun and a cocktail. We enjoyed our stay.

“Felt like staying at a retirement community...”


Reviewed 4 weeks ago



via mobile




Employees are very nice but rooms are well below average. If you are looking for a place to golf, this may not be the right one for you. The greens were not well kept and neither was the entire Palmer Course. For those who may want to practice after 4, don't even think about it. Their cart barn guys are 70 plus years of age and close the course before 5:30. Yes, if you are older or like to turn in really early, this is great. But, for normal aged people, you may know it is ludicrous to close a course before 5:30. I had played a round early in the day and wanted to practice later around 5 PM. I had gone to get a cart, and they told me that the course was closed, so I asked them nicely if they could get me a cart so I could play the round I PAYED for. They were single minded and non-negotiable. Awful golfing experience. And not to mention, most of the resort was vacant, so it certainly felt like a ghost town. Also, everything screams 1980s it is quite awful to be frank.

Hello Bradh0230, I am sorry to hear we did not met your expectations. I do not intend to make excuses but I feel you are owed some explanation. In regards to the golf course, both courses were aerified this month which makes them bumpy. However, it is necessary to maintain their condition in the long run. As summer begins our grass transitions from one type to another, as the heat kills certain types of grass. Its part of the natural order but we have hired some of the best people to meet this challenge. The first couple weeks are always the hardest until the newer grass fills in. As for the courses closing early this is to give the grass sometime to heal since its a delicate time. I hope from this you can tell there is a goal and thought put into these decisions, and they are not made lightly. As for the rooms you maybe happy to know we are currently beginning renovation of them. If you choose to return again we will improve on your stay.

“Amazing service and attention to clients”


Reviewed June 22, 2017




We really loved our stay at Saddlebrook. The tennis program was excellent and all the tennis instructors were knowledgeable and paid great attention to the details of every individual's needs. We came with our kids and had them participate in the junior tennis camp while my wife participated in the adult program. The tennis instruction for the kids and adults were absolutely first rate. The hotel service was also fabulous. The rooms were immaculate and spacious while the service was always friendly. We are definitely coming back!

Hello Victoria D, I'm sorry to hear not everything was to you liking during your stay. I am surprised you thought the pool temperature was to cold. All of our pools are heated and we maintain temperatures in the mid 80's. I will discuss with our pool maintenance staff to ensure there haven't been any issues.

Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
