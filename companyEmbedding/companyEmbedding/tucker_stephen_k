If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Work Gloves from Amazon.com Everything we do, including home improvement projects, typing, and making food for our kids, depends on our hands and our fine motor skills. The right set of work gloves from Amazon.com can protect you from a variety of hazards at your worksite or in your home so you can keep your hands healthy. No matter what you’re doing--hammering nails or gardening or spraying for termites--every job requires appropriate hand protection. Leather work gloves provide great cushioning and protection from pinching, cutting, abrasions, and other common worksite hazards. Our simple slip-on models are great for a variety of jobs from gardening projects to trenching for a construction team. Our heavy-duty welding gloves are ideal for protecting your arms and hands against threats such as sparks and hot shrapnel that are present in some welding circumstances. The increased padding of these glove linings ensures ultimate comfort and durability. Our waterproof work gloves are ideal for meeting safety standards on jobs that require chemicals, working in contaminated soil, and much more. If you’re doing a home project such as stripping paint from old furniture, pouring termite repellant underneath the crawlspace in your home, or even just cleaning your sinks with drain cleaners, it’s important to protect your skin from chemical burns. Now you can conveniently filter your search by price, so you can see the most affordable options first  If dexterity and fine detail is important to the job at hand, utility and fingerless work gloves may be the answer. Utility gloves are snug-fitting gloves in sturdy materials that won’t leave loose materials around your fingertips. They’re great for getting into tight spaces, like in a machine or motor, while providing excellent protection. Fingerless gloves free your fingers to give you tactile control over your jobs without losing protection for your palms, knuckles or wrists. We all depend so much on our hands. Protect your finger joints and skin with the quality work gloves from Amazon.com.
