			Cooper C. Collins has served as a director of our company since February 2012. Mr. Collins has served as Chief Executive Officer of Fortis BioPharma since June 2015.

[NASDAQ: PTX], or Pernix, from May 2013 until April 2014, as its President and Chief Executive Officer from March 2010 until May 2013, and as a director from March 2010 until February 2014. Pernix is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the sales, marketing, and development of branded and generic pharmaceutical products primarily for the pediatric market. Mr. Collins joined Pernix Therapeutics, Inc., a predecessor of Pernix, in 2002, where he was appointed as a director in January 2007, its President in December 2007, and its Chief Executive Officer in June 2008, serving in those three capacities until March 2010. From December 2005 to December 2007, Mr. Collins served as Vice President of Business and Product Development of Pernix Therapeutics, Inc. and as its Territory Manager from December 2003 to December 2005. Mr. Collins was employed for three years by the National Football League franchise, the New Orleans Saints, in its media relations department. We believe Mr. Collins' specialty pharmaceutical company knowledge and executive experience provide the requisite qualifications, skills, perspectives, and experience that make him well qualified to serve on our Board of Directors. While on a football scholarship, Mr. Collins received a B.A. from Nicholls State University, where he later received an M.B.A.

Chapter 14 - Developing and Pricing Goods and Services 
299. 
With a looming recession in front of him, department store owner Cooper Collins 
decided to make a gutsy move with his high-end Eastpointe stores. Rather than focus on 
the upscale, luxury market that the store attracted earlier in the decade, he focused on 
bringing in clothing with more mass appeal. The stores succeeded in turning around 
downward trending sales. In conjunction with your understanding of the product life 
cycle, which of the following statements summarizes the marketing strategy? 
A. 
Eastpointe recognized that it was not competing well with its traditional higher income 
market. It decided to change its product offering and price to appeal to a broader market 
and increase sales and profits. 
B. 
Eastpointe stores recognized several markets that it could reach with its upscale 
clothing lines. 
C. 
Eastpointe positioned itself against, rather than with, the competition. It decided to 
adhere to its price leadership position. 
D. 
Eastpointe knew that in order to re-invent itself, it was going to have to practice the 
same marketing strategy followed by Walmart and other discount stores. It would make all 
marketing decisions based on cost. The price on an item need only exceed what it cost to 
make and ship it. Falling prices became the norm. 
Feedback: 
When sales and profits begin to peak and drop off, products and services may have 
reached maturity, and it is time to reevaluate the 4 Ps and consider what differentiates the 
product to attract different market segments. 
Answer: A 
AACSB: Knowledge Application 
Bloom’s: Apply 
Learning Objective: 14-06 Describe the product life cycle 
Level of Difficulty: 3 Hard 
Topic: The Product Life Cycle and the Product Development Process 
300. 
Currently, which of the following products would most likely be considered in the 
growth stage of the product life cycle?
