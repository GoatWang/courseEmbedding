History[edit]
Wabash National was founded as a start-up in 1985 and has been publicly traded since 1991. The company was co-founded in April 1985 by Jerry Ehrlich, formerly the president of Monon Corp., an Indiana-based trailer manufacturer. Two years earlier, corporate raider Victor Posner had acquired Monon's parent company, Evans Products Co., and had proceeded to sell off its assets to pay debt. As Monon declined, Ehrlich repeatedly offered to buy the company but to no avail. Thus, Ehrlich and two fellow ex-Monon Corp. executives, Ronald J. Klimara and William M. Hoover, started their own company. They were soon joined by 14 other former Monon employees.[4]
Ehrlich and his associates established their company in Lafayette, Indiana, about 30 miles south of Monon Corp. and approximately 65 miles northwest of Indianapolis. In need of manufacturing facilities, Wabash initially leased a 450,000 square-foot abandoned factory then used by local farmers to store corn. The executives' experience and contacts helped Wabash acquire its start-up capital: $2 million in equity from Washington D.C. investors Steven and Mitchell Rales, a $3 million industrial revenue bond, and a $5 million line of credit from a local bank. Wabash's first trailer was reportedly built on two sawhorses and was finished in August 1985. Its first customer was Sears, Roebuck & Co., a former customer of Monon, which ordered ten trailers from Wabash.
With Ehrlich as Wabash's president, and Hoover and Klimara as vice-presidents of sales and finance, respectively, Wabash began to grow rapidly. Its client list soon expanded to include Heartland Express Inc., Schneider National Inc., and Dart Transit Co. In 1986, the company generated sales of $70 million from more than 15,000 trailers. That year the company also purchased a more suitable factory in the same area for about $2.5 million.
Products[edit]
Wabash National's product lines include a variety of dry freight vans, refrigerated vans, converter dollies, platform trailers, liquid tank trailers, intermodal equipment, engineered products and composite products. They also make high-quality laminated oak flooring used extensively in dry van trailers, truck bodies, and containers.
Facilities[edit]
Wabash National is headquartered in Lafayette, Indiana, also the site of its main production facility. Additional manufacturing plants are located in Cadiz, Kentucky, Harrison, Arkansas, Kansas City, Kansas, Portland, Oregon, New Lisbon, Wisconsin, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and San Jose Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico. After the investment of a manufacturing facility in Little Falls, Minnesota, Wabash National plans to "expand production operations for molded structural composites (MSC)."[5]
The company operates a network of dealerships in North America called Wabash National Trailer Centers.

        Shares of Wabash National Corporation Take a Post-Earnings Dip
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Tyler Crowe)

            Jul 26, 2017
        Updated Jul 27, 2017





































































































What happenedShares of truck-trailer manufacturer Wabash National Corporation (NYSE: WNC) are down 11.8% as of 2:00 p.m. EDT today. The reason for today's decline is tied to the company's earnings, which Wabash reported after the close yesterday.So what 
As is the case with any significant post-earnings price move, today's plunge relates to missing expectations. The company's revenue of $435 million and per-share earnings of $0.37 both missed expectations. Those results were also well below Wabash's results from the same quarter last year. To add insult to injury, management narrowed its 2017 earnings guidance from $1.44 to $1.56 per share to $1.44 to $1.50 per share.  Image source: Getty Images.Backing out the lens, though, this market reaction seems a bit overdone. To compare these results to the prior-year's results and say that this one was a failure seems a bit shortsighted when you consider that Q2 2016 was the best quarter in the company's history.Also, fiscal first-quarter results were weaker than these, but Wall Street decided to pump up shares by 10% after the prior-quarter's results. What's more, Wabash's management also revised its guidance for trailers shipped this quarter to 53,000 to 56,000. Yet, when the company announces that it has slightly better results and narrows its earnings guidance, it merits an 11% drop?Now what
This stock-price drop doesn't seem to coincide with what's going on at Wabash National right now. Perhaps the truck-trailer market has hit a high point, and the company's sales will deteriorate from here. If that's the case, then Wall Street would have a reason to sell off this stock. Looking at Wabash's results, though, it seems that the trailer market is in okay shape for at least the rest of the year, and tank trailers could see a nice boost as the petrochemical manufacturing boom hits the Gulf Coast.Also, the company seems to be in a great financial position to keep its share repurchases going for a while, as well as fund its dividend to shareholders. For those invested in Wabash at the moment, yesterday's earnings and today's stock-price reaction are hardly enough to change the investment thesis.

Why Wabash National Corp.'s 12.6% Drop in May is an Opportunity
It's only a matter of time before things turn around for the trailer manufacturer. 











                Neha Chamaria
            

                (Nehams)



            
            Jun 7, 2017 at 11:50AM
            
            





What happened
Wabash National Corp. (NYSE:WNC) stock was holding up well this year until it broke its winning streak last month and gave up all of its gains from April. Wabash ended May down 12.6%, its worst month so far in 2017. 
So what
Interestingly, there was no news from Wabash's end in May. The last big announcement that the trailer manufacturer made was its first-quarter earnings release in the last week of April which sent the stock soaring, and for good reasons.
Wabash's Q1 sales and earnings were down substantially from the year-ago quarter, which wasn't surprising given the sluggishness in the energy and chemical markets, both of which are critical markets for the company. Wabash is North America's leading manufacturer of liquid transportation systems.

Two factors appear to have gotten the market excited: Wabash beat earnings estimates and raised its full-year shipment as well as earnings per share outlook, albeit only marginally, by around 2% each. Nonetheless, Wabash reported operating income of $30.3 million -- its second-best Q1 ever on that metric -- and grew its free cash flow by 60%. That second number was particularly noteworthy as the company had just reinstated its dividend last December after a hiatus of six years.
Furthermore, Wabash's backlog also improved 8% sequentially to $863 million as at the end of the first quarter, reflecting an improvement in demand for trailers backed by stronger freight fundamentals.





Now what
End-market demand is nowhere close to where it was in 2014 and 2015, but Wabash is striving hard to boost margins by deleveraging and cutting costs while it waits for demand to improve. That is why management is confident of returning  to its historic gross margin norms in the range of 21% to 25% by the latter half of the year. For perspective, Wabash's gross profit margin in  Q1 was just around 16.4%.
I believe the drop in Wabash's shares in May was simply a case of profit booking. For long-term investors, though, this could just be the opportunity you've waiting for. Wabash boasts an incredible customer list that includes top trucking companies like FedEx, J B Hunt, and Navistar International, consumer companies like Nestle, and oil majors like BP to name a few. Also, Wabash serves several industries beyond its key chemical and energy clientele, among them pharma, food, and consumer. It's only a matter of time before these industries start spending more, and drive Wabash back onto the growth track. With its stock trading at less than 12 times trailing earnings, you may well want to hop on Wabash before the cycle turns.

History[edit]
Wabash National was founded as a start-up in 1985 and has been publicly traded since 1991. The company was co-founded in April 1985 by Jerry Ehrlich, formerly the president of Monon Corp., an Indiana-based trailer manufacturer. Two years earlier, corporate raider Victor Posner had acquired Monon's parent company, Evans Products Co., and had proceeded to sell off its assets to pay debt. As Monon declined, Ehrlich repeatedly offered to buy the company but to no avail. Thus, Ehrlich and two fellow ex-Monon Corp. executives, Ronald J. Klimara and William M. Hoover, started their own company. They were soon joined by 14 other former Monon employees.[4]
Ehrlich and his associates established their company in Lafayette, Indiana, about 30 miles south of Monon Corp. and approximately 65 miles northwest of Indianapolis. In need of manufacturing facilities, Wabash initially leased a 450,000 square-foot abandoned factory then used by local farmers to store corn. The executives' experience and contacts helped Wabash acquire its start-up capital: $2 million in equity from Washington D.C. investors Steven and Mitchell Rales, a $3 million industrial revenue bond, and a $5 million line of credit from a local bank. Wabash's first trailer was reportedly built on two sawhorses and was finished in August 1985. Its first customer was Sears, Roebuck & Co., a former customer of Monon, which ordered ten trailers from Wabash.
With Ehrlich as Wabash's president, and Hoover and Klimara as vice-presidents of sales and finance, respectively, Wabash began to grow rapidly. Its client list soon expanded to include Heartland Express Inc., Schneider National Inc., and Dart Transit Co. In 1986, the company generated sales of $70 million from more than 15,000 trailers. That year the company also purchased a more suitable factory in the same area for about $2.5 million.
Products[edit]
Wabash National's product lines include a variety of dry freight vans, refrigerated vans, converter dollies, platform trailers, liquid tank trailers, intermodal equipment, engineered products and composite products. They also make high-quality laminated oak flooring used extensively in dry van trailers, truck bodies, and containers.
Facilities[edit]
Wabash National is headquartered in Lafayette, Indiana, also the site of its main production facility. Additional manufacturing plants are located in Cadiz, Kentucky, Harrison, Arkansas, Kansas City, Kansas, Portland, Oregon, New Lisbon, Wisconsin, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and San Jose Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico. After the investment of a manufacturing facility in Little Falls, Minnesota, Wabash National plans to "expand production operations for molded structural composites (MSC)."[5]
The company operates a network of dealerships in North America called Wabash National Trailer Centers.

        Shares of Wabash National Corporation Take a Post-Earnings Dip
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Tyler Crowe)

            Jul 26, 2017
        Updated Jul 27, 2017





































































































What happenedShares of truck-trailer manufacturer Wabash National Corporation (NYSE: WNC) are down 11.8% as of 2:00 p.m. EDT today. The reason for today's decline is tied to the company's earnings, which Wabash reported after the close yesterday.So what 
As is the case with any significant post-earnings price move, today's plunge relates to missing expectations. The company's revenue of $435 million and per-share earnings of $0.37 both missed expectations. Those results were also well below Wabash's results from the same quarter last year. To add insult to injury, management narrowed its 2017 earnings guidance from $1.44 to $1.56 per share to $1.44 to $1.50 per share.  Image source: Getty Images.Backing out the lens, though, this market reaction seems a bit overdone. To compare these results to the prior-year's results and say that this one was a failure seems a bit shortsighted when you consider that Q2 2016 was the best quarter in the company's history.Also, fiscal first-quarter results were weaker than these, but Wall Street decided to pump up shares by 10% after the prior-quarter's results. What's more, Wabash's management also revised its guidance for trailers shipped this quarter to 53,000 to 56,000. Yet, when the company announces that it has slightly better results and narrows its earnings guidance, it merits an 11% drop?Now what
This stock-price drop doesn't seem to coincide with what's going on at Wabash National right now. Perhaps the truck-trailer market has hit a high point, and the company's sales will deteriorate from here. If that's the case, then Wall Street would have a reason to sell off this stock. Looking at Wabash's results, though, it seems that the trailer market is in okay shape for at least the rest of the year, and tank trailers could see a nice boost as the petrochemical manufacturing boom hits the Gulf Coast.Also, the company seems to be in a great financial position to keep its share repurchases going for a while, as well as fund its dividend to shareholders. For those invested in Wabash at the moment, yesterday's earnings and today's stock-price reaction are hardly enough to change the investment thesis.

History[edit]
Wabash National was founded as a start-up in 1985 and has been publicly traded since 1991. The company was co-founded in April 1985 by Jerry Ehrlich, formerly the president of Monon Corp., an Indiana-based trailer manufacturer. Two years earlier, corporate raider Victor Posner had acquired Monon's parent company, Evans Products Co., and had proceeded to sell off its assets to pay debt. As Monon declined, Ehrlich repeatedly offered to buy the company but to no avail. Thus, Ehrlich and two fellow ex-Monon Corp. executives, Ronald J. Klimara and William M. Hoover, started their own company. They were soon joined by 14 other former Monon employees.[4]
Ehrlich and his associates established their company in Lafayette, Indiana, about 30 miles south of Monon Corp. and approximately 65 miles northwest of Indianapolis. In need of manufacturing facilities, Wabash initially leased a 450,000 square-foot abandoned factory then used by local farmers to store corn. The executives' experience and contacts helped Wabash acquire its start-up capital: $2 million in equity from Washington D.C. investors Steven and Mitchell Rales, a $3 million industrial revenue bond, and a $5 million line of credit from a local bank. Wabash's first trailer was reportedly built on two sawhorses and was finished in August 1985. Its first customer was Sears, Roebuck & Co., a former customer of Monon, which ordered ten trailers from Wabash.
With Ehrlich as Wabash's president, and Hoover and Klimara as vice-presidents of sales and finance, respectively, Wabash began to grow rapidly. Its client list soon expanded to include Heartland Express Inc., Schneider National Inc., and Dart Transit Co. In 1986, the company generated sales of $70 million from more than 15,000 trailers. That year the company also purchased a more suitable factory in the same area for about $2.5 million.

History[edit]
Wabash National was founded as a start-up in 1985 and has been publicly traded since 1991. The company was co-founded in April 1985 by Jerry Ehrlich, formerly the president of Monon Corp., an Indiana-based trailer manufacturer. Two years earlier, corporate raider Victor Posner had acquired Monon's parent company, Evans Products Co., and had proceeded to sell off its assets to pay debt. As Monon declined, Ehrlich repeatedly offered to buy the company but to no avail. Thus, Ehrlich and two fellow ex-Monon Corp. executives, Ronald J. Klimara and William M. Hoover, started their own company. They were soon joined by 14 other former Monon employees.[4]
Ehrlich and his associates established their company in Lafayette, Indiana, about 30 miles south of Monon Corp. and approximately 65 miles northwest of Indianapolis. In need of manufacturing facilities, Wabash initially leased a 450,000 square-foot abandoned factory then used by local farmers to store corn. The executives' experience and contacts helped Wabash acquire its start-up capital: $2 million in equity from Washington D.C. investors Steven and Mitchell Rales, a $3 million industrial revenue bond, and a $5 million line of credit from a local bank. Wabash's first trailer was reportedly built on two sawhorses and was finished in August 1985. Its first customer was Sears, Roebuck & Co., a former customer of Monon, which ordered ten trailers from Wabash.
With Ehrlich as Wabash's president, and Hoover and Klimara as vice-presidents of sales and finance, respectively, Wabash began to grow rapidly. Its client list soon expanded to include Heartland Express Inc., Schneider National Inc., and Dart Transit Co. In 1986, the company generated sales of $70 million from more than 15,000 trailers. That year the company also purchased a more suitable factory in the same area for about $2.5 million.
Products[edit]
Wabash National's product lines include a variety of dry freight vans, refrigerated vans, converter dollies, platform trailers, liquid tank trailers, intermodal equipment, engineered products and composite products. They also make high-quality laminated oak flooring used extensively in dry van trailers, truck bodies, and containers.
Facilities[edit]
Wabash National is headquartered in Lafayette, Indiana, also the site of its main production facility. Additional manufacturing plants are located in Cadiz, Kentucky, Harrison, Arkansas, Kansas City, Kansas, Portland, Oregon, New Lisbon, Wisconsin, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and San Jose Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico. After the investment of a manufacturing facility in Little Falls, Minnesota, Wabash National plans to "expand production operations for molded structural composites (MSC)."[5]
The company operates a network of dealerships in North America called Wabash National Trailer Centers.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7-MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, and our capital resources and liquidity as of December 31, 2016. Our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the North American trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we took in 2016 to strengthen the Company. We then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years, including the trends in the overall business and our operating segments, followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, capital markets events and transactions, our credit facility and contractual commitments. We also provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made that we believe are most important to an understanding of our MD&A and our consolidated financial statements. These are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements. We conclude our MD&A with information on recent accounting pronouncements that we adopted during the year, if any, as well as those not yet adopted that may have an impact on our financial accounting practices.  During the second quarter of 2016, we realigned our reporting segments into two segments, Commerical Trailer Products and Diversified Products. As a result of the realignment, the businesses previously operating within the former retail segment are now reported in one of these two segments. We undertook the realignment in an effort to strengthen the alignment between our manufacturing businesses and our retail sales and service operations, improve profitability and capitalize on growth opportunities. The Commercial Trailer Products segment manufactures standard and customized van and platform trailers, truck bodies and other transportation related equipment to customers who purchase directly from us, through independent dealers or Company owned branch locations through which we provide service and support. The Diversified Products segment, comprised of four strategic business units including, Tank Trailer, Aviation & Truck Equipment, Process Systems, and Composites, focuses on our commitment to expand our customer base and diversify our product offerings, end markets, and revenues. The Diversified Products segment also seeks to extend our market leadership by leveraging the proprietary DuraPlate(R) panel technology, drawing on our core manufacturing expertise and making available products that are complementary to truck and tank trailers and transportation equipment we offer. The prior periods for each of our reporting segments below has been restated to reflect this realignment. Certain corporate-related administrative costs, interest, and income taxes are not allocated to these two segments, but are reported in our Corporate and Eliminations segment.  Executive Summary  2016 provided another year of strong overall demand for trailers. According to ACT estimates, total new trailer industry shipments were 287,000 units in 2016, while a reduction of 7% from the record levels achieved in 2015, this represents the second best year in the past fifteen and is the sixth consecutive year that total trailer demand exceeded normal replacement demand levels, currently estimated to be approximately 220,000 trailers per year.  We delivered consolidated results for 2016 that set new records for profitability for the fifth consecutive year, including gross profit, gross profit margin, operating income and operating margin. The overall strength in the Company's operating performance highlights the success of our growth and diversification initiatives driven by our long-term strategic plan to continue to transform the Company into a diversified industrial manufacturer with a higher growth and margin profile, while maintaining our focus and expertise in lean and six sigma optimization initiatives. These efforts made it possible to achieve record levels of operating income in 2016 totaling $202.5 million, as well as a 210 basis point improvement in operating income margin to a record level of 11.0%. More specifically, we leveraged the healthy demand environment to drive profitable growth through improved pricing and a commitment to favor margin over volume, operational excellence and supply chain optimization.  In addition to our commitment to sustain profitable growth within each of our existing reporting segments, our long-term strategic initiatives included a focus on diversification efforts, both organic and strategic, to continue to transform Wabash into a diversified industrial manufacturer with a higher growth and margin profile and successfully deliver a greater value to our shareholders. Our ability to generate record margins and cash flows and a healthy balance sheet positions the Company with ample resources to (1) fund our internal capital needs to support both organic growth and productivity improvements, (2) assure continued reduction of our debt obligations, (3) return capital to shareholders and (4) selectively, but more actively, pursue strategic acquisitions. Strategically, we continue our internal effort to proactively identify potential acquisition targets that we believe can create shareholder value and accelerate our growth and diversification efforts, while leveraging our strong competencies in manufacturing execution, sourcing and innovative engineering leadership to assure strong value creation. Organically, our focus is on profitably growing and diversifying our operations through leveraging our existing assets, capabilities and technology into higher margin products and markets and thereby providing value-added customer solutions.  Throughout 2016 we demonstrated our commitment to be responsible stewards of the business by maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. Our continuing strong operational performance, healthy backlog and industry outlook, and financial position provided us the opportunity to take specific actions as part of the ongoing commitment to prudently manage the overall financial risks of the Company, returning capital to our shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet. These actions included completing $77 million in share repurchases as authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2016, executing agreements with existing holders of our outstanding Convertible Senior Notes to purchase approximately $82 million in principal and, in December 2016, reinstating a regular quarterly dividend to the holders of our common stock. Collectively, these actions demonstrate our confidence in the financial outlook of the company and our ability to generate cash flow, both near and long term, and reinforces our overall commitment to deliver shareholder value while maintaining the flexibility to continue to execute our strategic plan for profitable growth and diversification.  The outlook for the overall trailer market for 2017 continues to indicate a strong demand environment. In fact, the most recent estimates from industry forecasters, ACT and FTR, indicate demand levels expected to be in excess of the estimated replacement demand in every year through 2021. More specifically, ACT is currently estimating 2017 demand will be approximately 261,000, down 9% as compared to the previous year period, with 2018 through 2021 industry demand levels ranging between 252,000 and 267,000 trailers. In addition, FTR anticipates trailer production for 2017 to remain strong at approximately 259,000 trailers, a decrease of 10% as compared to 2016 levels. This continued strong demand environment for new trailer equipment as well as the positive economic and industry specific indicators we monitor reinforce our belief that the current trailer demand cycle will be an extended cycle with a strong likelihood for several more years of demand above replacement levels. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected strong overall demand levels while maintaining or growing margins through improvements in product pricing as well as productivity improvements and other operational excellence initiatives.  However, we are not relying solely on volume and product pricing within the trailer industry to improve operations and enhance profitability. We remain committed to enhancing and diversifying our business model through the organic and strategic initiatives discussed previously. Through our two operating segments we offer a wide array of products and customer-specific solutions that we believe provide a sound foundation for achieving these goals. Continuing to identify attractive opportunities to leverage our core competencies, proprietary technology and core manufacturing expertise into new applications and end markets enables us to deliver greater value to our customers and shareholders.  Operating Performance  We measure our operating performance in five key areas - Safety/Morale, Quality, Delivery, Cost Reduction and Environment. We maintain a continuous improvement mindset in each of these key performance areas. Our mantra of being better today than yesterday and better tomorrow than we are today is simple, straightforward and easily understood by all our employees.  � Safety/Morale. The safety of our employees is our number one value and highest priority. We continually focus on reducing the severity and frequency of workplace injuries to create a safe environment for our employees and minimize workers compensation costs. We believe that our improved environmental, health and safety management translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time away from work and improved system management. In ten of the last eleven years at least one of our manufacturing sites has been recognized for safety including recent awards from the Truck Trailer Manufacturer Association's Plant Safety Awards granted to our New Lisbon, Wisconsin and Portland, Oregon facilities. Our focus on safety also extends beyond our facilities. We are a founding member of the Cargo Tank Risk Management Committee, a group dedicated to reducing the hazards faced by workers on and around cargo tanks.  � Quality. We monitor product quality on a continual basis through a number of means for both internal and external performance as follows:  - Internal performance. Our primary internal quality measurement is Process Yield. Process Yield is a performance metric that measures the impact of all aspects of the business on our ability to ship our products at the end of the production process. As with previous years, the expectations of the highest quality product continue to increase while maintaining Process Yield performance and reducing rework. In addition, we currently maintain an ISO 9001 registration of our Quality Management System at our Lafayette operations.  - External performance. We actively track our warranty claims and costs to identify and drive improvement opportunities in quality and reliability. Early life cycle warranty claims for our van trailers are trended for performance monitoring. Using a unit based warranty reporting process to track performance and document failure rates, early life cycle warranty units per 100 trailers shipped averaged approximately 2.6, 2.0 and 3.4 units in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Improvements in claims have been driven by our successful execution of continuous improvement programs centered on process variation reduction, and responding to the input from our customers. We expect that these activities will continue to drive down our total warranty cost profile.  � Delivery/Productivity. We measure productivity on many fronts. Some key indicators include production line cycle-time, labor-hours per trailer and inventory levels. Improvements over the last several years in these areas have translated into significant improvements in our ability to better manage inventory flow and control costs.  - During the past several years Commercial Trailer Products has focused on productivity enhancements within manufacturing assembly and sub-assembly areas through developing the capability for mixed model production. These efforts have resulted in throughput improvements in our Lafayette, Indiana, and Cadiz, Kentucky facilities.  - During the past two years, Diversified Products continued improving the flexibility and efficiency of their operations. The launch of our new Wabash Composites facility in Frankfort, Indiana, leased to provide dedicated manufacturing space to support the expanding product line and continued growth of our Composites business, allows us to manufacture our diverse product offerings more efficiently. Diversified Products also has broadened its tank trailer manufacturing versatility by adding production capabilities for petroleum trailers to our Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, manufacturing facility and pneumatic dry bulk trailers to our Portland, Oregon; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; and New Lisbon, Wisconsin, facilities. We have also benefitted from the added capacity at our facility in Queretaro, Mexico for stationary silos for food, dairy and beverage industries, to better serve the markets in Southern U.S., Mexico and South America.  � Cost Reduction. We believe continuous improvement is a fundamental component of our operational excellence focus. Our continued focus on our balanced scorecard process has allowed us to improve all areas of manufacturing including safety, quality, on-time delivery, cost reduction, employee morale and environment. By focusing on continuous improvement and utilizing our balanced scorecard process we have realized total cost per unit reductions as a result of increased capacity utilization of all facilities while maintaining a lower level of fixed overhead. We also have a tank trailer manufacturing facility in Queretaro, Mexico that provides a low cost advantage for our tank trailer product line.  � Environment. We strive to manufacture products that are both socially responsible and environmentally sustainable. We demonstrate our commitment to sustainability by maintaining ISO 14001 registration of our Environmental Management System at our Lafayette, Indiana; San Jose Iturbide, Mexico; and Cadiz, Kentucky facilities. In 2005, our Lafayette, Indiana facility was one of the first trailer manufacturing operations in the world to be ISO 14001 registered. Being ISO 14001 registered requires us to demonstrate quantifiable and third-party verified environmental improvements. In 2016, our Frankfort, Indiana and Cadiz, Kentucky facilities also achieved ISO 14001 registration. At our facilities, we initiated employee-based recycling programs that reduce waste being sent to the landfill, installed a fifty-five foot wind turbine to produce electricity and reduce our carbon emissions, and restored a natural wildlife habitat to enhance the environment and protect native animals.  Industry Trends  Truck transportation in the U.S., according to the ATA, was estimated to be a $726 billion industry in 2015. ATA estimates that approximately 70% of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks. Trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported. To monitor the state of the industry, we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the transportation industry. Recent trends we have observed include the following:  � Transportation / Trailer Cycle. The trailer industry generally follows the transportation industry cycles. After three consecutive years with total trailer demand well below normal replacement demand levels estimated to be approximately 220,000 trailers, the five year period ending December 2015 demonstrated consecutive years of significant improvement in which the total trailer market increased year-over-year approximately 64%, 14%, 1%, 15% and 15% for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, with total shipments of approximately 204,000, 232,000, 234,000, 269,000 and 308,000, respectively. The 2015 trailer shipments represent an all-time industry record. In 2016, trailer shipments declined by approximately 6% year-over-year to approximately 287,000 units. As we enter the eighth year of an economic recovery, ACT is estimating demand within the trailer industry in 2017 at approximately 261,000 and forecasting continued strong demand levels into the foreseeable future with estimated annual average demand for the four year period ending 2021 to be approximately 257,000 new trailers. Our view is generally consistent with ACT that trailer demand will remain significantly above replacement levels for 2017 and has the potential to remain above replacement levels for several years beyond 2017.  � New Trailer Orders. According to ACT, total orders in 2016 were approximately 229,000 trailers, a 28% decrease from 316,000 trailers ordered in 2015. Total orders for the dry van segment, the largest within the trailer industry, were approximately 133,000, a decrease of 31% from 2015.  � Transportation Regulations and Legislation. There are several different areas within both federal and state government regulations and legislation that are expected to have an impact on trailer demand, including:  - The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the "FMCSA") has taken steps in recent years to improve truck safety standards, particularly by implementing the Compliance, Safety, and Accountability ("CSA") program as well as requiring Electronic Logging Devices ("ELDs"). CSA is considered a comprehensive driver and fleet rating system that measures both the freight carriers and drivers on several safety related criteria, including driver safety, equipment maintenance and overall condition of trailers. This system drives increased awareness and action by carriers since enforcement actions were targeted and implemented beginning in June 2011. CSA is generally believed to have contributed to the tightening of the supply of drivers and capacity after 2011 as carriers took measures to improve their rating. The FMCSA issued a mandate that all carriers must install ELDs by December 2017. Industry estimates on carrier productivity losses as a result of ELDs range from 3% to 10%. We believe this ruling is likely to have a more significant impact on capacity than anticipated and may ultimately drive increased demand for new equipment as carriers attempt to recover lost productivity. While industry estimates vary, it is likely that only roughly half the industry utilizes ELDs right now, meaning that a good portion of owner-operators and carriers will either adopt the new technology, shut down, or be acquired.  - In July 2013, a new FMCSA hours-of-service rule went into effect, reducing total driver hours from 82 hours per week to 70 hours. Congress included language in the 2016 spending package that requires the agency to meet an appropriate safety, driver health and driver longevity standard before re-imposing those restrictions. Specifically, the language prohibits FMCSA from reinstating certain sections of the rule's 34-hour restart provisions unless an FMCSA study finds that they result in statistically significant improvements in safety and driver health, among other things. We believe this language will make it very difficult for FMCSA to justify reinstituting the restart restrictions. In other words, the simple 34-hour restart rule, with no additional restrictions, will likely remain in place for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, we believe the rule will keep trucking equipment utilization at record-high levels and, therefore, increase the general need for equipment.  - There are several new regulations that may come into effect in the next two years, including Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse Requirement, Speed Limiters, and Corporate Average Fuel Economy among others. The cumulative effect of the existing and upcoming regulations will be a further decrease in driver productivity and reduction of the driver pool, which will likely lead to higher demand for additional drivers and equipment to fill the gap.  - The U.S. EPA and NHTSA agencies proposed new greenhouse gas regulations in July 2015, in an effort to reduce fuel consumption and production of carbon dioxide of heavy duty commercial vehicles. Following a comment period, the final rule was released in August 2016 and currently with U.S. Congress to determine whether it will become effective. The rule focuses mainly on van trailers, and is divided into four increasingly stringent greenhouse gas reduction standards. The rule requires fuel saving technologies on van trailers, such as trailer side skirts, low rolling resistance tires, and automatic tire inflation systems, to become standard equipment starting in January 2018. For tank trailers and flatbed trailers, the rule will require low rolling resistant tires and automotive tire inflation systems beginning in 2018. More stringent van trailer standards will come into play in model years 2021, 2024 and 2027 - requiring more advanced fuel efficiency technologies, such are rear boat tails and higher percentage improvement side skirts and tires. In addition to increasing the cost of a trailer, these regulations may also lead to a higher demand for various aerodynamic device products.  - The California Air Resource Board ("CARB") regulations mandate that refrigeration units older than seven years may no longer operate in California. As refrigeration units become obsolete, capacity in the refrigerated segment will tighten and an increase in demand for new refrigerated trailers is likely. CARB regulations also mandate fuel efficiency improvements on all fleets operating in California for which our various aerodynamic solutions provide a durable and cost effective product that yields the improved fuel efficiencies required by these regulations.  � Other Developments. Other developments and potential impacts on the industry include:  - While we believe the need for trailer equipment will be positively impacted by the legislative and regulatory changes addressed above, these demand drivers could be offset by factors that contribute to the increased concentration and density of loads, including the miniaturization of electronic products and packaging optimization of bulk goods. Increases in load concentration or density could contribute to decreased need or demand for dry van trailers.  - Trucking company profitability, which can be influenced by factors such as fuel prices, freight tonnage volumes, and government regulations, is highly correlated with the overall economy of the U.S. Carrier profitability significantly impacts demand for, and the financial ability to purchase new trailers.  - Fleet equipment utilization has been rising due to increasing freight volumes, new government regulations and shortages of qualified truck drivers. As a result, trucking companies are under increased pressure to look for alternative ways to move freight, leading to more intermodal freight movement. We believe that railroads are at or near capacity, which will limit their ability to respond to freight demand pressures. Therefore, we expect that the majority of freight will continue to be moved by truck and, according to ATA, freight tonnage carried by trucks is expected to increase approximately 24% throughout the next decade.

History[edit]
Wabash National was founded as a start-up in 1985 and has been publicly traded since 1991. The company was co-founded in April 1985 by Jerry Ehrlich, formerly the president of Monon Corp., an Indiana-based trailer manufacturer. Two years earlier, corporate raider Victor Posner had acquired Monon's parent company, Evans Products Co., and had proceeded to sell off its assets to pay debt. As Monon declined, Ehrlich repeatedly offered to buy the company but to no avail. Thus, Ehrlich and two fellow ex-Monon Corp. executives, Ronald J. Klimara and William M. Hoover, started their own company. They were soon joined by 14 other former Monon employees.[4]
Ehrlich and his associates established their company in Lafayette, Indiana, about 30 miles south of Monon Corp. and approximately 65 miles northwest of Indianapolis. In need of manufacturing facilities, Wabash initially leased a 450,000 square-foot abandoned factory then used by local farmers to store corn. The executives' experience and contacts helped Wabash acquire its start-up capital: $2 million in equity from Washington D.C. investors Steven and Mitchell Rales, a $3 million industrial revenue bond, and a $5 million line of credit from a local bank. Wabash's first trailer was reportedly built on two sawhorses and was finished in August 1985. Its first customer was Sears, Roebuck & Co., a former customer of Monon, which ordered ten trailers from Wabash.
With Ehrlich as Wabash's president, and Hoover and Klimara as vice-presidents of sales and finance, respectively, Wabash began to grow rapidly. Its client list soon expanded to include Heartland Express Inc., Schneider National Inc., and Dart Transit Co. In 1986, the company generated sales of $70 million from more than 15,000 trailers. That year the company also purchased a more suitable factory in the same area for about $2.5 million.
Products[edit]
Wabash National's product lines include a variety of dry freight vans, refrigerated vans, converter dollies, platform trailers, liquid tank trailers, intermodal equipment, engineered products and composite products. They also make high-quality laminated oak flooring used extensively in dry van trailers, truck bodies, and containers.
Facilities[edit]
Wabash National is headquartered in Lafayette, Indiana, also the site of its main production facility. Additional manufacturing plants are located in Cadiz, Kentucky, Harrison, Arkansas, Kansas City, Kansas, Portland, Oregon, New Lisbon, Wisconsin, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and San Jose Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico. After the investment of a manufacturing facility in Little Falls, Minnesota, Wabash National plans to "expand production operations for molded structural composites (MSC)."[5]
The company operates a network of dealerships in North America called Wabash National Trailer Centers.

History[edit]
Wabash National was founded as a start-up in 1985 and has been publicly traded since 1991. The company was co-founded in April 1985 by Jerry Ehrlich, formerly the president of Monon Corp., an Indiana-based trailer manufacturer. Two years earlier, corporate raider Victor Posner had acquired Monon's parent company, Evans Products Co., and had proceeded to sell off its assets to pay debt. As Monon declined, Ehrlich repeatedly offered to buy the company but to no avail. Thus, Ehrlich and two fellow ex-Monon Corp. executives, Ronald J. Klimara and William M. Hoover, started their own company. They were soon joined by 14 other former Monon employees.[4]
Ehrlich and his associates established their company in Lafayette, Indiana, about 30 miles south of Monon Corp. and approximately 65 miles northwest of Indianapolis. In need of manufacturing facilities, Wabash initially leased a 450,000 square-foot abandoned factory then used by local farmers to store corn. The executives' experience and contacts helped Wabash acquire its start-up capital: $2 million in equity from Washington D.C. investors Steven and Mitchell Rales, a $3 million industrial revenue bond, and a $5 million line of credit from a local bank. Wabash's first trailer was reportedly built on two sawhorses and was finished in August 1985. Its first customer was Sears, Roebuck & Co., a former customer of Monon, which ordered ten trailers from Wabash.
With Ehrlich as Wabash's president, and Hoover and Klimara as vice-presidents of sales and finance, respectively, Wabash began to grow rapidly. Its client list soon expanded to include Heartland Express Inc., Schneider National Inc., and Dart Transit Co. In 1986, the company generated sales of $70 million from more than 15,000 trailers. That year the company also purchased a more suitable factory in the same area for about $2.5 million.
Products[edit]
Wabash National's product lines include a variety of dry freight vans, refrigerated vans, converter dollies, platform trailers, liquid tank trailers, intermodal equipment, engineered products and composite products. They also make high-quality laminated oak flooring used extensively in dry van trailers, truck bodies, and containers.
Facilities[edit]
Wabash National is headquartered in Lafayette, Indiana, also the site of its main production facility. Additional manufacturing plants are located in Cadiz, Kentucky, Harrison, Arkansas, Kansas City, Kansas, Portland, Oregon, New Lisbon, Wisconsin, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and San Jose Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico. After the investment of a manufacturing facility in Little Falls, Minnesota, Wabash National plans to "expand production operations for molded structural composites (MSC)."[5]
The company operates a network of dealerships in North America called Wabash National Trailer Centers.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Building on Success In 1985, a small group of innovators and entrepreneurs led by Donald J. “Jerry” Ehrlich began manufacturing trailers in Lafayette, Indiana. Wabash National Corporation (NYSE: WNC) was born. We quickly became the leading American manufacturer of semi-trailers by introducing new technologies such as the DuraPlate® composite panel as well as design innovations that allow the largest fleets across the country to operate more successfully. Today, Wabash National Corporation is a diversified industrial manufacturing business with an expanding product portfolio, a growing presence in a number of industries and a commitment to continuous improvement. We serve customers across three strategic segments: Commercial Trailer Products, Diversified Products, and Retail. Our products are widely recognized and highly regarded, often holding the number-one position in market share across their respective categories. Our brands include: Wabash National®, Transcraft®, Benson® , DuraPlate®, Walker®, Brenner®, Garsite™, Progress Tank™, Bulk Tank International™, and Extract Technology®. We are strongly positioned for growth and motivated by the same spirit of innovation and leadership that drove our early success.

Wabash National's Earnings Show Its Product Diversification Strategy is Proving Effective
Moving away from dry van trailers is proving effective in boosting margins and offsetting the cyclical nature of the business











                Tyler Crowe
            

                (TMFDirtyBird)



            
            Apr 26, 2017 at 9:33AM
            
            





The market reacted rather favorably when Wabash National (NYSE:WNC) released its earnings and updated guidance for 2017. Much of that optimism can be attributed to management's efforts over the past several years to transform Wabash from a cyclical manufacturer of a low margin product to a diversified manufacturer of transportation products that can handle the ups and downs of the market.
Let's take a look at Wabash's most recent results to see why this past quarter was another step in the right direction as well as what investors can expect from Wabash in the coming quarters.

*in millions, except per-share data. Source: Wabash National earnings release.
Like all earnings releases, there are some good and bad points worth hashing over. One thing that stands out as less than desirable is the decline in sales in the past quarter. This was expected, though, as management's guidance for 2017 was 51,000-55,000 trailers shipped in 2017 -- down from 2016's total sales of 58,850 trailers. In fact, sales for the quarter were better than expected as management was able to raise its trailer shipment guidance to 52,000-56,000 for the year. 
One thing that is worth celebrating is that the company appears on track to meet its product diversification goal. A few years back, Wabash put a strategic plan out to 2020 to improve profitability and returns on invested capital across the business. One way it chose to do that was to diversify its product offerings. In 2005, 77% of its revenue came from dry van trailer sales -- these trailers are the ones towed by 18-wheelers you see on the road. In 2016 that number had declined to 64%. These diversified product offerings have higher margins and have helped drive bottom line results over the past few years.
Non-dry van trailer sales for the first quarter were a little weaker than expected. Management mostly attributed that to "softness" in the chemical and energy segments. It's true that the chemical manufacturing and energy industries haven't been knocking it out of the park as of late, but they are certainly two segments doing much better than a year ago. It will be worth watching to see if its non-dry van sales continue to struggle as these two industries are on the mend. 
One thing that stands out is Wabash's free cash flow for the quarter, which was up 60% despite earnings declining. A large part of that was because of a $32 million drawdown of working capital. That said, free cash flow even after adjusting for the working capital changes was enough to pay dividends and buy back stock. Management expects it will be able to keep its dividends and buybacks going for a while now that it has drastically reduced its total debt load over the past few years.

From the mouth of management
CEO Dick Giromini, on the company's results for the quarter and his expectations for the rest of the year:

Performance targets in cost management and execution were achieved within both Commercial Trailer Products and Diversified Products, as gross margins delivered were consistent with expectations previously communicated, despite trailer shipments slightly below prior guidance due strictly to timing of customer pick-up. Backlog grew once again, coming in at a seasonally and historically strong $863 million, continuing to support our long-standing belief that trailer fleet age, regulatory compliance requirements, and customer profitability provide strong support for a continued favorable demand environment.
Additionally, we remain focused on driving further productivity improvements throughout the business, optimizing the cost structure and performance of our Diversified Products segment, and developing growth opportunities through new product and market expansion efforts.






10-second takeaway
Manufacturing tractor trailers and other trucking-related products is very much a cyclical business. The past year or two have been some of the better years as customers have had to replace aging fleets of trailers and make up for underinvestments from the financial crisis. Based on the decline in orders as of late, it would appear that we are either at the top of the cycle or are headed back down again.
Luckily for Wabash National investors, the company has diversified its product offerings, improved operating margins, and strengthened its balance sheet since the last downturn. These should help it weather a market downturn if we are indeed headed that way, or it could mean Wabash is poised to generate strong results as the market plateaus. Either way, Wabash National looks to be in much better shape than in years past and is worth putting on one's radar.

If you are concerned how this may be possible or how would you find records to help you find somebody with an online request, it's simple. These are Public Records. When you are prepared to begin a Public Records search, you can essentially just go to our Public Records site and enter your name or another person's name in the inquiry bar and with a few direct steps, you can access records for anybody that you want. You have search throughout the day, consistently and you can search conveniently from home. 

Searching for Public Records? The speediest way to find the records you want is to go to our online database. It's super easy to start.
