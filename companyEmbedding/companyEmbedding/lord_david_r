 Product Description 

The 42nd Annual Brigham Young University Sidney B. Sperry Symposium
The Psalmist asks, “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?” This year’s Sperry Symposium discusses ascending into the Lord’s moun- tain within the context of theophany, ancient temple worship, sacred space, sacrifice, offerings, and hymns and songs in the text of the Old Testament and the Book of Mormon. The scriptures contain a rich treasury of information of how ancient Israelites and the people in the Book of Mormon worshipped God and expressed themselves through ritual and devotions as found in the Psalms. These explorations of ancient temple worship help us to better understand and appreciate latter-day temple and worship traditions.

            What an excellent resource! The author has given many thought-provoking ideas about a very familiar topic - the Lord's Prayer. Who would have thought some much meaning could be derived by so few verses? I am enjoying it immensely.

            In my opinion every Christian should read this book. I have started a Bible study using, "the Lord's Prayer" . Once you read this book you will have a better understading of what it means to have God as your Father.

            This is the best book I have read on The Lord's Prayer. I have three, and each one contains good teaching on using this as a guide in our prayer life...This one delves deeply into some of Jesus' underlying meaning in challenging us to actually "live" the prayer. I am currently setting up a summer "book review" study group using it. I highly recommend it to all christians. The bargain price is another plus!

PRAISE THE LORD – I











Description



Product Description
We have heard the word “praise” so often as nothing else in the Christian world. Believers greet each other with the words “Praise the Lord”. The things that praising the Lord could accomplish are much more than what we could humanly comprehend. There is nothing that can take the place of praise in the spiritual world. There is life in praise. Our praises can do great damage in the enemy’s kingdom.
Psalm 8: 2 says, “Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength Because of Your enemies, That You may silence the enemy and the avenger.”
When we as children of God begin to praise God, God starts moving on our behalf. God is the one who does the battle. The Bible says, “The battle belongs to the Lord”. Our God is the mighty warrior. The Bible repeatedly says, that the Lord will fight for us. When can you activate our God to fight? That is when you begin to praise. It is very simple, yet profound.
On the other hand, our praises silences the enemy. Silence, is the word that we are meditating on. In other words, the mouth of the enemy is bound when we praise God. That is why the enemy tries to keep us from praising. He often reminds us of the negative things that happened to us. He tells us that we do not have what it takes and on and on and on.
Look at the life of David. He had to flee for his life from his very own son, Absalom. David did not get down and discouraged. He began to praise the Lord. Psalm 3: 3 says, “But You, O Lord, are a shield for me, My glory and the One who lifts up my head”.
The way the Lord comes through is just amazing. David said in Paslm 3: 7 (b), “…For you have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone, You have broken the teeth of the ungodly”. Here David knows the secret of praise and also knows what happens to the enemy when we praise God. The Lord is no respecter of persons. If He did it for David, He will do it for you. He is just as committed to you as He is to David.
When we praise God, we literally silence our enemies. The enemy keeps talking to us day and night about things that are not the will of God for us. Therefore it becomes necessary for us to silence him. If we do not silence the enemy he will continue to talk defeat into our lives and that is the reason we often feel so beat up at the end of the day. Praise shuts Satan up.
Satan always keeps blabbering into the ears of people viz., television, radio and other avenues. He loves to discourage God’ people. He tempts us continually. One of the key areas he operates is by talking. All day long the enemy tirelessly talks criticism and condemnation. It is the believer’s responsibility to stop him.
In the Garden of Eden, the enemy talked to Eve about something that was not true. He is still talking into the ears of God’ people who would let him. Do you know who has the key to make the enemy keep quiet? We have the key. You and I have the key. Imagine we putting the enemy in a place where he cannot talk. That is exactly what we do to the enemy when we begin to praise the Lord.
We read in the Bible that David’s praise would calm down the enemies of King Saul. 1 Samuel 16: 23 says, “And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him”.
Before the walls of Jericho fell, we see that the army marched around the walls. Each day seven priests would blow the trumpets. The people who were marching in the front were the trumpeters. This is because praise is such an important component for victory.
Joshua 6: 5, 6 says, “It shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you bear the sound of the trumpet, that all the people shall shout with a great shout. Then the wall of the city will fall down flat, And the people shall go up every man straight before him,” Then Joshua the son of Num called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord.”
What are the kinds of walls are you facing today? If you want those walls to fall down, begin praising the Lord for who He is right now.
May the Lord help you praise the Lord in Jesus’ name. Amen
