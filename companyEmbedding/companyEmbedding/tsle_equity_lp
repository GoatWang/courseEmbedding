* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to

About LP Equity
 



LP Equity, LLC was formed in 2005 with the aim of creating a secondary market for otherwise illiquid limited partner interests. In the past 11 years LPE has invested over $40M in direct partnership buyouts, acquiring minority interests in over 300 different partnerships while helping thousands of limited partners to simplify their finances and escape continuing tax liabilities. With over 25 years of industry experience, the principals at LPE have become experts in the complex tax, government regulatory, and partnership issues that traditionally govern these transactions, enabling us to sidestep recapture issues and put forward cash offers that in most cases will supersede those of other potential buyers. With our extensive industry knowledge and long-term investment horizon, and with two modern offices run out of Washington, DC, and Wilmington, NC, respectively, we have never been in a better position to help minority partners realize immediate value on their decades-old investments.
