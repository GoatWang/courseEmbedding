Roy D. Shapiro is the Philip Caldwell Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration.  He is currently the faculty co-chair of the School's Technology and Operations Management Unit and chairs the MBA Required Course of the same name. He has taught elective courses in supply chain management and operations strategy as well as in Harvard University's Economics Department.  He has also served as the School's Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Planning.He graduated from M.I.T. with an S.B. in Mathematics, an M.S. in Operations Research, and an E.E. in Electrical Engineering. After some time designing computer models for radar tracking with Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Mass., he spent several years as an associate with Control Analysis Corp., a small Palo Alto, California-based consulting firm while obtaining a Ph.D. in Operations Research from Stanford University. Professor Shapiro researches innovative systems and management approaches that integrate and coordinate material and information flows through the supply chain, so as to reduce or eliminate redundant activities. His work addresses coordinating mechanisms (e.g., continuous product replenishment, CPFR) that tie different supply chain entities together; how the attendant relationships are defined, forged, and managed; and information flows among relationship partners and how they are effectively generated, shared, and communicated.Professor Shapiro has designed and/or taught executive programs for companies including Arthur Andersen, Ciba-Geigy, General Electric, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Sara Lee, Schneider Electric, and Unilever. He has served as a consultant in both the public and private sectors: for Boston's Children's Hospital, the states of New York and California, and the Steel Service Center Institute; and for firms including Barilla, Eastman Kodak, Italtel, Johnson & Johnson, Frito-Lay, Perkin Elmer, and others. In addition to his activities in the U.S., Professor Shapiro has designed and taught executive programs and consulted in the U.K., Finland, France, Italy, Egypt, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, China and Japan.Print Entire ProfileLess

Delwarca Software Remote Support Unit
Roy D. Shapiro and Paul E. Morrison
Delwarca Software provides business software to large corporate clients around the world. The firm serves customers who prefer to assemble corporate solutions using a combination of software programs from various suppliers rather than implementing a single enterprise resource planning system. Consequently, Delwarca must provide telephone support services for complex software-hardware interaction and performance problems in addition to the typical software support issues around software installation and upgrades, malware attacks, and processing failures. The manager of the remote support unit implemented a new triage program for customer calls hoping to reduce customer wait time, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce costs. After one year, customer dissatisfaction is at an all-time high and he must perform a quantitative analysis of the current process, considering wait times for customers as well as cost per call, before making a final recommendation. This case can be used in a first-year MBA course in Service Management or Operations Management or a course in industrial engineering. It can also be used to introduce simple queuing theory.

Bayonne Packaging, Inc.
Roy D. Shapiro and Paul E. Morrison
A printer and paper converter produces customized packaging used by industrial customers to deliver promotional materials, software, luxury beverages, and gift food and candy. The company specializes in creating innovative packaging solutions for its customers and providing full service from design through final delivery. Even though revenue has tripled, performance has been declining and the firm posted its first loss in over 10 years. The new VP of Operations has been hired to address operational problems resulting in cost overruns, quality problems, and late deliveries. He tours key departments including quality control and sales and visits the various work centers in the plant as he investigates the challenges in the current production process. This case can be used in a first-year MBA-level course in Operations Management. Students are asked to create a process flow diagram and perform break-even, capacity, utilization, and yield analyses before making their final recommendations for improving the firm's performance.

IFP, Indonesia
Roy D. Shapiro
IFP, Ltd. is a Europe-based multinational mining and minerals company contemplating an investment to produce forest products in Indonesia. The primary case decisions are 1) how to assess political and operating risk, 2) how to integrate economic and political risk analysis in order to select among the alternative spatial and operating configurations, and 3) how to manage operations in order to minimize risk. This case is an effective vehicle for discussing the complex issues involved in operating in the difficult, uncertain political environment of a developing country.

DR Corporation
Roy D. Shapiro
DR Corporation is a manufacturer of major appliances. The traffic manager is facing a decision of selecting a carrier for the inbound movement of motors. The primary case decisions are 1) what factors are critical to the decision; 2) how to calculate the tradeoffs among transportation costs, inventory costs, and order costs; and 3) how the company's managers should coordinate to make the decision. Acts as a very effective introduction to total supply chain cost calculations and problems of internal coordination for supply chain decision making. Coupled with ChemBright, DR Corporation is a particularly effective way to introduce supply chain management.

Reading Rehabilitation Hospital: Implementing Patient-Focused Care (A) (Abridged)
Roy D. Shapiro
Reading Rehab Hospital has experimented with a popular concept in health care--patient-focused care--intended to increase quality and reduce costs by organizing care delivery around particular diagnoses or "service lines," rather than around the functions or disciplines of the care providers. It is equivalent to a product rather than a process focus. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether the benefits of this new healthcare model are sufficient to compensate for the drawbacks.

eShip-4U
Roy D. Shapiro and Timothy M. Laseter
eShip is a small Israeli start-up with a potentially exciting new concept for the residential package-delivery value chain--the Automatic Delivery Machine (ADM). Much like today's ubiquitous ATMs, ADMs would allow consumers to have parcels delivered to a nearby ADM rather than to their residences. When a package is delivered, the consumer would be contacted, given a PIN, and could retrieve the package anytime, day or night. Currently, carriers (FedEx, UPS, and the U.S. Postal Service) bear huge costs for local deliveries (the so-called last-mile cost), perhaps as much as $6 billion annually. Most of this cost would disappear if packages could be delivered to ADMs rather than to residences. At the core of eShip's concept is a sophisticated information system that links all the ADMs over the Internet. This case focuses on eShip's attempt to formulate a business model to facilitate entering the U.S. market. The dilemma centers on the role that eShip should play in the value chain and with whom it should partner. Although the ADM concept potentially creates huge value, capturing some of that value is a daunting challenge, particularly in the face of the size and power of U.S. carriers.

The management of a small manufacturer of circuit boards faces a number of production and operations management problems. The first day on this case is used to analyze the production capacity of various stages in the process and to examine bottlenecks and key production flow decisions. The emphasis is on physical flows. The second day the emphasis is on information flows. We look in detail at the problems faced by the company, discuss the tools and techniques of process analysis that can be used to determine the relative importance of those problems, identify solutions, and discuss implementation issues.

Ellis finds itself in a weakening competitive position largely due to the lack of rationalization in its plants. Driven by a strong traditionally decentralized sales organization, Ellis finds that all plants want control over all product lines. As a result, overall economics of scale are not achieved, and duplication of resources has weakened Ellis' cost position. Case gives enough data for students to make specific recommendations.

Bose Corp.: The JIT II Program (A)
Roy D. Shapiro and Bruce Isaacson
Bose Corp. is evaluating an unusual plan to manage relationships with vendors that supply components for Bose speakers. The company must decide: 1) which planning and ordering activities should be performed by Bose and which can be performed by vendors, 2) how much access vendors should have to Bose computer systems and facilities, and 3) how to adapt vendor relations as the company grows or as markets change. Students are asked to consider both the buyer's and the vendor's perspective on the buyer-seller relationship.

Quantum Semiconductor, Inc.
Janice H. Hammond and Roy D. Shapiro
Quantum is faced with a difficult ethical dilemma--industry studies provide evidence that chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing may cause women working in fabrication cleanrooms to suffer a higher likelihood of spontaneous abortions. The possibility of other reproductive health risks exist also. Barring all women of child-bearing age from fabrication areas may be viewed as sex discrimination and cause legal ramifications. Full automation is too costly for this small company. What should they do?
