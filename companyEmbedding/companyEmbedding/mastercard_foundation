Our Work





Our programs assist people living in poverty by providing access to education, financial inclusion and skills training, with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan Africa.


We put the people we serve at the center of our program design and take a holistic, long-term approach to our work.





We Believe
The key to prosperity is through education, skills training and financial inclusion
See More of Our Work 



Financial Inclusion

Hundreds of millions of people in Africa, many of them living in poverty, lack access to basic financial products and services. In many rural and remote communities there are simply no bank branches or ATMs. Banks and other financial service providers often see these clients as too risky, too remote and too poor to serve.
Financial inclusion means that low-income individuals, households and small businesses have access to and can effectively use appropriate financial services such as savings, credit and insurance. It also means these services are provided responsibly and sustainably in a well-regulated environment.


Access to appropriate financial services allows people greater opportunity to reach their economic goals. It can also enable those living in poverty to smooth the financial impacts of unexpected crop failure, food shortage, illness or other negative events in their lives. READ MORE

SEE OUR FINANCIAL INCLUSION WORK 

Education & Learning Program

Millions of young people in Africa lack access to a quality education. Only  20 percent of young people move from primary to secondary school and only 5 percent transition to university. Research shows that education is an effective path out of poverty, particularly for women.
We define education as learning that takes place both within and outside of the formal school system. Our partnerships focus on providing quality, accessible secondary and tertiary education, as well as skills development for those living in poverty.


With chronic unemployment and underemployment on the continent, we believe it is important to focus on appropriate education that addresses foundational skills, such as literacy and numeracy, as well as market-relevant skills that young people need to transition to employment, such as digital literacy and financial management.

Youth Livelihoods 

Many young people lack the necessary skills to find formal or stable informal employment. In Africa, young people are about three times more likely to be unemployed than adults, and globally, almost 200 million young people require a second chance to develop the skills necessary to find employment.
There are a number of hurdles that young people in Sub-Saharan Africa face in gaining these skills. Educational institutions may not provide a relevant or high-quality curriculum that addresses the needs of the labour market. Young people may also not have the chance to develop work experience in the formal sector or they may have to drop out of school due to cost.


Our Youth Livelihoods Program helps the transition from education to employment by providing young people with a comprehensive and tailored package of support. Providing economically disadvantaged young people with a combination of training, life skills and financial literacy will prepare them to transition to meaningful employment and entrepreneurship opportunities.

MASTERCARD FOUNDATION SCHOLARS PROGRAM 

MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program provides quality secondary and university education to economically disadvantaged but academically talented young people living in Sub-Saharan Africa. Scholars selected for the Program have shown a commitment to giving back to their communities.


In addition to education, these students receive skills training, leadership development, mentoring and transition support. The Scholars Program is fostering a cohort of next-generation leaders who will contribute to social transformation and economic growth on the continent… READ MORE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
The MasterCard Foundation and CGAP forge $11.4 million Partnership to Develop Effective Financial Products for the Poor
Washington, D.C., 20 November 2012: Today, CGAP announced a partnership with The MasterCard Foundation to develop effective and low-cost financial products that meet the needs of the poor. This $11.4 million initiative will support CGAP’s activities in two priority areas to advance access to financial services. Over four years, CGAP will expand access to branchless banking services in West Africa, while convening critical research into the preferences and behaviors of clients.
Branchless banking refers to technologies, such as payment cards and mobile systems, which provide people living in poverty with financial services at a dramatically lower cost. CGAP’s Technology and Business Model Innovation Program has worked in this field since 2006. As part of the partnership, CGAP will expand its work into West Africa, where it aims to serve one million clients in four years.
In addition, CGAP engages in detailed client research, using those insights to design better financial service products for the poor. Through its Client work stream, CGAP will identify vital research questions to spur development of effective products. CGAP will also work with the industry to answer practical questions on client impact, preferences and behavior, with a particular focus on improving approaches to reach two client segments: the extreme poor and youth.
“Branchless banking and client research are two important areas that have the potential to make financial services available to millions of unbanked people.” said Tilman Ehrbeck, CEO of CGAP. “Applying the lessons from client research to develop branchless banking solutions tailored specifically to the needs of the poor can shape our thinking on financial inclusion in a fundamental and meaningful way.”
"This partnership will provide the microfinance industry with deeper insights about the preferences and behaviours of clients," said Reeta Roy, President and CEO of The MasterCard Foundation. "The knowledge generated will help financial institutions better serve those living in poverty, and will result in the creation of diverse, technology-driven products." 
About CGAP
CGAP (The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor) is the world's leading resource for the advancement of microfinance. CGAP provides the financial industry, governments and investors with objective information, expert opinion, and innovative solutions to effectively expand access to finance for poor people around the world. More information: www.cgap.org 
About The MasterCard Foundation
The MasterCard Foundation advances microfinance and youth learning to promote financial inclusion and prosperity. Through collaboration with committed partners in 49 countries, The Foundation is helping people living in poverty to access opportunities to learn and prosper. An independent, private foundation based in Toronto, Canada, it was established through the generosity of MasterCard Worldwide at the time of the company’s initial public offering in 2006.

          MasterCard Foundation Fund for Rural Prosperity launches opportunity for Financial Services Provider
      

The MasterCard Foundation Fund for Rural Prosperity (FRP) has launched a new competition to find and support providers of innovative and scalable financial products and services that improve the lives of poor people in rural areas of Africa.
The 2017 competition will follow a ‘rolling’ format. It will be open throughout the year with applications submitted and evaluated periodically. The first submission period will close for judging on August 10, 2017. Unsuccessful applicants will be able to refine and resubmit their applications subsequently, along with new entrants in the competition.
The Fund for Rural Prosperity will accept applications for innovative financial solutions that expand and deepen financial inclusion for poor people in rural areas of Africa. It will also support selected solutions that have already been successfully implemented and are being scaled to a new sector, a new geographic area, or for a new use.
Applications can be from any financial services provider in any country in the world providing the solution proposed is implemented in specific countries of Africa (see the list of countries below). With this new model of competition, The MasterCard Foundation Fund for Rural Prosperity expects to receive a high number of quality proposals focused on enabling people living in poverty to participate in the formal financial sector of their country.
Since its launch in 2015, the Fund has held four competitions. Nineteen projects across Sub-Saharan Africa have been provided with financial support. The Fund has committed US$23,802,913 to these projects.
The 2017 competition launch coincides with the announcement of the 2016 Innovation Competition winners. Three projects have been awarded support by the Fund to implement innovative financial solutions. A total of US$3,000,000 has been committed to these firms:


Ibero Uganda Limited
First Access
Letshego Financial Services Mozambique

“Our Fund for Rural Prosperity has already met its initial objective of improving the lives of one million smallholder farmers and poor people in rural Africa,” said Ann Miles, Director of Financial Inclusion at The MasterCard Foundation. “We have seen financial services providers step up with truly innovative and scalable ideas to drive financial inclusion for this group of people. We hope that other actors in this space are taking note so that they, too, can emulate or support success and bring the benefits of financial inclusion to millions more people.”
More information about the 2017 rolling competition, including application forms, guidance notes, and details on eligible countries are available on the website at www.frp.org

Many folks they bring over on a work Visa that can't leave a company for 5 years. Then they work them to death. If you are not on a product team you likely will be just managing propaganda and branding your team. More work is spend on saying "look what I did" at MasterCard than actually doing work unless you are on a product team.On a product team it is pretty much working 24x7 to get the product out the door on a shoe string budget. Cowboy style of delivery where you throw something together and pull the trigger to get it into production and hope for the best. Tehnical folks are required to be available ALL of the time. Long hours in the middle of the night and all night on many occasions. No overtime pay unless you are consulting but if you record what you work, they'll get rid of you and get someone you will work more but report less. Leadership does not typically work more than 50 hours a week where technical resources can be working ALL of the time. The greatest caution I can give you if you decide to work for MasterCard is be positive always and never make a negative comment or be too objective. Roll with the flow and stay away from the front of the bus. Extremely political climate with low technical aptitude individuals in the technical ranks. The culture for technical folks is to get a bunch of people in a room and have them fight it out. The best salesman wins vs. the most intelligent one or the one with the most experience. If you have a sales background with just a generalist understanding of technology, you'll do great at MasterCard. If you are a specialist with experience vs. just reading something and selling it, you'll go crazy. Nothing worse than having more technical vs. sales skills in the MasterCard environment. Other largest con I can think of is that you will receive no pay for performance at all. It is entirely based on what project you are working on. Little in the way of career growth at MasterCard. This is a consulting environment and nothing more. You will not grow. Though I'm an SBL, I am one of the few that lead and the pressures for shoestring budget are ridiculous.Advice to Managementpay for performancestop killing your technical labor force - don't let business folks working 40 hours a week drive technical resources to work 100 hours a week and report less in the name of a shoestring budget.The best advice I can give to management is that you need managers. I've been in 15 different teams over the years and only ran into 2 true leaders. The rest were admin folks on a power trip or young inexperience yopros which is the most common.. You need more experienced business leaders that have intelligence not just youg enegetic individuals with low amounts of experience. In a very long timeframe I've only ran into one Senior Business Leader that was leading over there team. It's like a country club at that level. Have these folks coach and manage.

MasterCard Foundation: Grants for Global Development

April 12, 2017/



Sue-Lynn Moses and Renata Redford



OVERVIEW: The MasterCard Foundation focuses its global development grantmaking on financial inclusion, education and learning, and youth livelihoods.IP TAKE: The MasterCard Foundation funds a wide range of issues, but is not an easily accessible foundation as it tends to partner with large NGOs and academic institutions over local and grassroots organizations.PROFILE: Gifted with shares from the financial services company MasterCard, The MasterCard Foundation was established in 2006 and functions separately from its corporate sister.  The foundation ultimately seeks to “advance education and financial inclusion to catalyze prosperity in developing countries.” It prioritizes giving in Africa to create an "inclusive, more equitable Africa by supporting the implementation of proven development models and scalable approaches." The foundation believes that the key to prosperity is through "education, skills training and financial inclusion," and as such, its investments reflect this dedication. The foundation prioritizes initiatives related to education, inclusion, the livelihood of young people, and improving access to financial services, among others. In order to foster and facilitate more opportunities for disadvantaged populations in low-income countries, the foundation awards grants through three main programs: Financial Inclusion, Education & Learning, and Youth Livelihoods. While The MasterCard Foundation has awarded grants to projects in low-income countries around the world, Africa is now the priority region.Preferring a more broad approach, the foundation's programs tackle larger issues on multiple fronts. For example, its Financial Inclusion program not only awards grants for financial product and services access, but also for rural and agricultural financing, expanding informal savings groups, microcredit, and mobile banking. The MasterCard Foundation's grants range from $100,000 to $250,000 for multi-year programs. The foundation also awards several  grants between $1 million to $5 million. However, it does not accept unsolicited letters of inquiry about funding or what it refers to as “concept notes.” The foundation occasionally issues requests for proposals. As well, its Fund for Rural Prosperity—a $50 million "challenge program" to expand rural financial services in Africa—has a two-stage application process.Information is a bit sparse on The MasterCard Foundation’s application process for the remainder of its programs. According to the foundation’s most recent tax filings, once it reviews a concept note, if the work aligns with the foundation’s objectives, it will invite the applicant to submit a full proposal. The best bet, here, would be to reach out to program staff for clarity on the foundation’s application process.PEOPLE:  Reeta Roy, President and CEOAnn Miles, Director, Youth Livelihoods and Financial InclusionPeter Materu, Director, Education and LearningLindsay Wallace, Director, Learning and Strategy  LINKS:  Giving philosophyFund for Rural Prosperity

History[edit]
The foundation was established in 2006 through a gift of shares from MasterCard Worldwide at the time of the company's IPO.[3] Reeta Roy was named the foundation's president and CEO in 2008.[4]
Programs[edit]
The MasterCard Foundation increases access to financial services and educational opportunities. To achieve this, it partners with nonprofit and non-governmental organizations that focus on the key areas of Financial Inclusion and Youth Learning.[5][self-published source?]
Financial Inclusion[edit]
Financial inclusion is where low-income individuals, households, and small businesses have access to and can effectively use appropriate financial services (formal and non-formal, from a range of providers). The foundation's Financial Inclusion program works with partners to expand access to and increase the reach of financial services. Its stated goals include: scaling access to financial services; pioneering financial services for youth; and promoting responsible finance.[6][self-published source?]
The foundation's financial inclusion partners include ACCION International, the Aga Khan Foundation, BRAC, CARE Canada, Catholic Relief Services, Freedom from Hunger, Grameen Foundation, Fonkoze, Microfinance Information Exchange Inc., Microfinance Opportunities, Microfinance Transparency, Opportunity International, Plan Canada, Save the Children, The SEEP Network, Water.org, Women's World Banking, UNCDF, Equity Group Foundation, Mennonite Economic Development Association (MEDA), Participatory Microfinance Group for Africa (PAMIGA) and The MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program.[7][self-published source?]
Education & Learning[edit]
The Foundation's Education & Learning program promotes financial education inside and outside of formal school systems, and seeks to use the market to benefit youth and prepare them for the market. The program's goals include: scaling access to education in Sub-Saharan Africa; developing employment-seeking skills in youth;[8][self-published source?] and developing skills in out-of-school youth.
Youth Learning partners include the African Leadership Academy, Camfed, the International Labour Organization, International Youth Foundation, Education for Employment Foundation, Digital Opportunity Trust, Equity Group Foundation, Aflatoun, YouthBuild, Educate!, Swisscontact, Fundacion Paraguaya, CAP Foundation, TechnoServe and the University of Minnesota.[9][self-published source?]
The MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program[edit]
The MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program provides talented and disadvantaged young people, particularly in Africa, with access to education. It builds on a network of education institutions and nonprofit organizations that provide education and support to young people who are academically gifted, who have demonstrated leadership capacity, and have committed to giving back to their communities.[10]
Foundation Scholars partners include Ashesi University, Arizona State University, BRAC Uganda, Camfed, Duke University, EARTH University, McGill University, Michigan State University, Stanford University, University of British Columbia, University of California, Berkeley, University of Toronto, Wellesley College, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and Makerere University.

I'm wanting a card that will give me cash back or points(not sure how it works) mainly for airplane tickets, (I like Southwest Airlines the best)I want to be able to use the card on any purchase. I have great credit. We are wanting to eventually pay for all the tickets for my family to go on vacation. Which would be the best card?

The are a number of travel rewards credit cards that might be a good fit for you. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is one great option because you can transfer the points you earn with this card directly to your Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards account. A few other good choices for flexible travel rewards would be the Discover It Miles, Capital One Venture or BankAmericard Travel Rewards.

Which card is best for my daughter who wants to earn free airfare from NC to maui, and possibly asia.  We need to be able to earn this airfare quickly, as her trip is this september.  I have excellent credit, and I want to earn the most miles possible (even if we have to spend some money on the card).  As long as it's free the first year, it's fine.

The Capital One Venture and the Barclaycard Arrival Plus would both be great options for your situation. Both of these cards come with big sign up bonuses and offer flexible travel rewards!

One great choice for your situation would be the Discover It Cashback Match. This card comes with an extra long intro APR that would help you finance your home remodel interest free and there is also an excellent cash back rewards program so you can earn rewards on all of your purchases.

I'm retired but with a secure income and top rated credit.  I also pay off my balance every month.  What's the best cash back card for someone who spends about $1400 a month?

Picking the best cash back card for you will depend on how you spend your money. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries and gas, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express and BankAmericard Cash Rewards would both be excellent options as they offer bonus cash back on certain purchases. But if you would prefer and credit cards with a consistently high rewards rate on all purchases, the Citi Double Cash would be a great choice.

If you have no credit, you will probably need to start with a secured credit card. Secured cards work just like normal credit cards, but you have to put down a refundable security deposit to get approved. After a year or so of responsible use, you will have built up your credit enough to get approved to a standard, unsecured credit card. The Capital One Secured MasterCard and the Discover it Secured Credit Card are both great options.

Hello,
Right now I have a $5,000 dollar balance on a card with a 20.65% APR. and an annual fee that is billed monthly $3. I have a 732 Credit score and want to look in to a balance transfer to a card with a lower APR so I can get a more manageable credit card debt. Which card would you recommend?

The Chase slate card doesn't have the frills or points, but it is an excellent balance transfer card.

Must have extensive dental work. I am looking for a new card just for this. I would like no interest for max. months. Would the dental work be considered a purchase? The dentist doesn't offer terms. I have excellent credit-mid 800's. Cash back would be great, but not necessary.

If the merchant will allow you to pay with a credit card then the transaction should be considered a purchase. If you're looking for the longest possible intro APR, consider the Citi Simplicity or the Citi Diamond Preferred. These cards don't offer cash back, so if you'd like cash back plus a long intro period check out the Discover It Cashback Match.

Deciding which rewards card is best may vary based on how you usually spend your money. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries and gas, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express  is probably your best choice. But if you're simply looking for a credit card with a great flat rewards rate on every purchase, the Citi Double Cash is an excellent option.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
