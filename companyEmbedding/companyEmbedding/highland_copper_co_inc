					Full Description



		Highland Copper Company Inc is a Canada-based copper development company. The Company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral projects located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the United States. Its projects include Copperwood, White Pine and Keweenaw. Copperwood is a feasibility stage project. The Copperwood deposit is located in Gogebic County in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; within the Copper Range copper district and approximately 30 kilometers west of the White Pine North Project. The White Pine copper deposit is located in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan on the south side of Lake Superior. It is a sediment-hosted stratiform copper-silver deposit. White Pine lies on the south flank of the Midcontinent Rift System, an over 2,000 kilometer long structure of Precambrian age. The Keweenaw Copper Project, which hosts the 543S and G-2 deposits, covers approximately 9,000 acres of mineral rights.

Description




Highland Copper Company Inc is a Canada-based copper development company. The Company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral projects located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the United States. Its projects include Copperwood, White Pine and Keweenaw. Copperwood is a feasibility stage project. The Copperwood deposit is located in Gogebic County in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; within the Copper Range copper district and approximately 30 kilometers west of the White Pine North Project. The White Pine copper deposit is located in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan on the south side of Lake Superior. It is a sediment-hosted stratiform copper-silver deposit. White Pine lies on the south flank of the Midcontinent Rift System, an over 2,000 kilometer long structure of Precambrian age. The Keweenaw Copper Project, which hosts the 543S and G-2 deposits, covers approximately 9,000 acres of mineral rights.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

Shares Seesawing on Volume: Highland Copper Company Inc. (HI.V) – Clayton News

Shares Seesawing on Volume: Highland Copper Company Inc. (HI.V)


July 27, 2017 Sarah Dixon     
	










Shares of Highland Copper Company Inc. (HI.V) is moving on volatility today 0.00% or $0.00 rom the open. The TSXV listed company saw a recent bid of $0.10 on 44500 volume. When it comes to securing profits in the stock market, investors may be trying to find a perfect system to help attain that goal. Dedicated investors may try strategies that have been passed on to them from other seasoned investors. Even after reading every piece of literature about investing, it might be hard to figure out which way is the best way to successfully conquer the market.  Studying up on company fundamentals and following technical stock levels can be a good place to start, but creating and implementing a plan can be difficult. As we all know, markets change over time. What drives a market during one point in time may not drive the market at a future date. Knowing what to look for when studying technical levels or fundamentals may help lead down the path to increased profits. Many investors will choose to study the indicators with the highest probability of forecasting future market action. 
Now let’s take a look at how the fundamentals are stacking up for Highland Copper Company Inc. (HI.V). Fundamental analysis takes into consideration market, industry and stock conditions to help determine if the shares are correctly valued. Highland Copper Company Inc. currently has a yearly EPS of -0.03. This number is derived from the total net income divided by shares outstanding. In other words, EPS reveals how profitable a company is on a share owner basis. 
Another key indicator that can help investors determine if a stock might be a quality investment is the Return on Equity or ROE. Highland Copper Company Inc. (HI.V) currently has Return on Equity of -6.64. ROE is a ratio that measures profits generated from the investments received from shareholders. In other words, the ratio reveals how effective the firm is at turning shareholder investment into company profits. A company with high ROE typically reflects well on management and how well a company is run at a high level. A firm with a lower ROE might encourage potential investors to dig further to see why profits aren’t being generated from shareholder money. 
Another ratio we can look at is the Return on Invested Capital or more commonly referred to as ROIC. Highland Copper Company Inc. (HI.V) has a current ROIC of -6.38. ROIC is calculated by dividing Net Income – Dividends by Total Capital Invested. 
Similar to ROE, ROIC measures how effectively company management is using invested capital to generate company income. A high ROIC number typically reflects positively on company management while a low number typically reflects the opposite. 
Turning to Return on Assets or ROA, Highland Copper Company Inc. (HI.V) has a current ROA of -5.65. This is a profitability ratio that measures net income generated from total company assets during a given period. This ratio reveals how quick a company can turn it’s assets into profits. In other words, the ratio provides insight into the profitability of a firm’s assets. The ratio is calculated by dividing total net income by the average total assets. A higher ROA compared to peers in the same industry, would suggest that company management is able to effectively generate profits from their assets. Similar to the other ratios, a lower number might raise red flags about management’s ability when compared to other companies in a similar sector.
Investors may be taking a closer look stock market trends as we move into the second half of the year. Investors often have to grapple with the timing of selling a stock. After all the research is done and the portfolio is rounded out, the time will eventually come when decisions need to be made about whether to hold a winner or sell to lock up some profits. Often times, investors will hold on to a certain stock for much too long letting profits erode. Thinking that a hot stock will keep going higher and higher, may lead to lost profits further down the road. On the flip side, investors may become emotionally attached to a stock and not be able to part ways when the time has come. Avoiding the trap of waiting for a stock to bounce back and just break even can lead to the undoing of the portfolio. The belief that a particular stock will definitely come back to the buying level may leave investors out in the cold. Being able to keep the emotions in check and stay focused on the pertinent data, may help the stock portfolio thrive into the future.
