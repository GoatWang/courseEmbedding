(the "Above-Referenced Funds")

 Supplement to Current Prospectus:

Effective immediately, the sub-section entitled "Management of the Fund -       
Shareholder Servicing Agent" in the prospectuses of the Above-Referenced Funds  
is restated as follows:                                                         

Shareholder Servicing Agent                                                     

MFS Service Center, Inc. ("MFSC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, provides   
transfer agent and recordkeeping functions in connection with the issuance,     
transfer, and redemption of each class of shares of the fund under a Shareholder
Servicing Agent Agreement. Under the Agreement, MFSC may receive a fee based on 
the costs it incurs in providing these services, including payments made to     
affiliated and unaffiliated service providers that provide certain accounting,  
network, subtransfer agent and other shareholder services (shareholder servicing
payments) and out-of-pocket expenses, plus a target profit margin.              

Effective February 1, 2007, in the section entitled "Description of Share       
Classes" in the prospectuses of the Above-Referenced Funds, the sentence that   
reads "Class R shares are available for purchase only by retirement plans that  
held class R shares of the fund on March 31, 2005" is restated as follows:      

Class R shares are available for purchase only by retirement plans that held    
Class R shares of a fund on March 31, 2005, and by retirement plans (other than 
plans for which MFS or an affiliate provides participant recordkeeping, and     
plans for which MFS Heritage Trust Company serves as a trustee) that are held by
MFSC at the plan or omnibus level.                                              

Effective immediately, either the last three paragraphs of the sub-section      
entitled "Description of Share Classes - Financial Intermediary Compensation" or
the last two paragraphs of the sub-section entitled "Description of Share       
Classes - Financial Intermediary Support Payments" in the prospectuses of the   
Above-Referenced Funds are restated as follows:                                 

In addition, financial intermediaries may receive payments from MFD from MFD's  
own additional resources as incentives to market the MFS funds, to cooperate    
with MFD's promotional efforts and/or in recognition of their

P-->497Last�Page�of�2TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�2nd
marketing, administrative services, and/or processing support. This compensation
from MFD is not  reflected  in the fees and  expenses  listed  in the fee  table
section of the fund's prospectus. MFD compensates financial intermediaries based
on  criteria  established  by MFD from time to time that  consider,  among other
factors, the level, and/or type of marketing and administrative support provided
by the financial intermediary,  the level of assets attributable to and/or sales
by the financial  intermediary and the quality of the overall  relationship with
the financial intermediary.                                                     

These additional payments by MFD may take the form of payments to financial     
intermediaries that provide marketing support and administrative services to MFD
with respect to fund shares sold or held through the financial intermediary's   
retail distribution network and/or through programs such as retirement programs,
qualified tuition programs, fund supermarkets, fee-based advisory or wrap fee   
programs, bank trust programs, and insurance (e.g., individual or group annuity)
programs. MFD may also make payments to financial intermediaries to help offset 
the cost associated with client account maintenance support, statement          
preparation, and transaction processing. To the extent permitted by SEC and NASD
rules and other applicable laws and regulations, MFD may make other payments or 
allow other promotional incentives or payments to financial intermediaries.     

You can find further details in the SAI about the payments made by MFD and the  
services provided by financial intermediaries. Financial intermediaries may     
charge you additional fees and/or commissions other than those disclosed in this
prospectus. You can ask your financial intermediary for information about any   
payments it receives from MFD and any services it provides, as well as about    
fees and/or commissions it charges. Financial intermediaries that sell fund     
shares may also act as a broker/dealer in connection with a MFS fund's purchase 
or sale of portfolio securities. However, the fund and MFS do not consider      
financial intermediaries' sales of shares of a MFS fund as a factor when        
choosing broker/dealers to effect portfolio transactions for the MFS funds.     

 The date of this supplement is January 1, 2007.
