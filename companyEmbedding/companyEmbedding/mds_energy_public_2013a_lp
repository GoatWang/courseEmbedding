IMPLICATIONS
OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY.

 

The
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”)
became law in April 2012. The Partnership is an “emerging
growth Company” as defined in the JOBS Act, and it is
eligible for certain exemptions from, or reduced disclosure
obligations relating to, various reporting requirements that
usually apply to public companies.

 

These
exemptions include, among others, not being required to comply with
the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, any requirements adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) which require
mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the
auditor’s report in which the auditor must provide additional
information about the audit and the issuer’s financial
statements, nor with new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after
April 5, 2012, unless the SEC determines otherwise. The Partnership
has not yet decided whether to use any or all of the
exemptions.

 

Additionally,
under Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an “emerging growth
company” is eligible for the extended transition period
provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the
“Act”) to comply with new or revised accounting
standards. This means an “emerging growth company” can
delay adopting certain accounting standards until those standards
otherwise become applicable to private companies. However, the
Partnership is electing to “opt out” of that extended
transition period, and therefore will comply with new or revised
accounting standards on the dates the standards are required for
non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides
that the Partnership’s decision to opt out of the extended
transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting
standards is irrevocable.

 

The
Partnership could continue to be an “emerging growth
company” until the earliest of:

 




 



(i)



the last
day of the first fiscal year in which it has total annual gross
revenue of $1 billion or more;




 




 



(ii)



the last
day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date
of the first sale of its units pursuant to its prospectus and
Registration Statement with the SEC;




 




 



(iii)



the date
that it becomes a “large accelerated filer” as defined
in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”), which would occur if the market value
of its units held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured
as of the last business day of its most recently completed second
fiscal quarter; or




 




 



(iv)



the date
on which it has, during the preceding three year period, issued
more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt.




 

The
Partnership anticipates that it will continue to be an emerging
growth company until the termination of the five year period
described in (ii), above.

NOTES TO
UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

September
30, 2016

 

NOTE 1 -
ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS

 

On May 3,
2012 (date of inception), MDS Energy Public 2013-A LP
(Partnership), a Delaware limited partnership, was formed for the
purpose of drilling developmental natural gas wells. The
Partnership has a maximum 50-year term, although the Partnership
intends to terminate when all of the wells invested in by the
Partnership become uneconomical to continue to operate, which may
be approximately 15 years or longer. The Partnership was formed by
MDS Energy Development, LLC (MDS), a related party, as the Managing
General Partner (MGP) and M/D Gas, Inc. (M/D), a related party. In
accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement, the
MGP is authorized to manage all activities of the Partnership and
initiates and completes substantially all transactions.

 

In our
opinion, the accompanying condensed financial statements contain
all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the
Partnership’s financial statements for interim periods in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and with the instructions to
Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Accordingly,
pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain notes and other
financial information included in audited financial statements have
been condensed or omitted. The information presented in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with
the Partnership’s audited financial statements and notes
thereto included in its 2015 Form 10-K. The results of operations
for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the
results of operations to be expected for the full year.

 

The MGP on
behalf of the Partnership intends to apply for deregistration of
the Partnership with the SEC upon issuance of the 2016 Form 10-K.
This is described more here within the accompanying
notes.

 

NOTE 2 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Proved
Property Impairment - The Partnership assesses its producing
natural gas properties for possible impairment, upon a triggering
event, by comparing net capitalized costs to estimated undiscounted
future net cash flows on a well by well basis using estimated
production based upon prices at which the Partnership reasonably
estimates the commodities to be sold.  The estimates of future
prices may differ from current market prices of natural gas. 
Certain events, including but not limited to, downward revisions in
estimates to the Partnership’s reserve quantities,
expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs,
could result in a triggering event and, therefore, a possible
impairment of the Partnership’s proved natural gas
properties.  If net capitalized costs exceed undiscounted
future net cash flows, the measurement of impairment is based on
estimated fair value utilizing a future discounted cash flows
analysis, which is predominantly unobservable data or inputs, and
is measured by the amount by which the net capitalized costs exceed
their fair value.  Estimated undiscounted future net cash
flows are determined using prices from the forward price curve at
the measurement date.  Estimated discounted future net cash
flows are determined utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate that
is based on rates utilized by market participants that are
commensurate with the risks inherent in the development of the
underlying natural gas reserves.  Due to prices remaining
relatively flat from year end 2015 through September 30, 2016, the
Partnership did not recognize an impairment charge for the third
quarter 2016 to it’s proved natural gas properties.  The
Partnership has an impairment charge of proved natural gas
properties of approximately $11,810,700 as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015.

 

Asset
Retirement Obligations - The Partnership applies the provisions of
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and
“Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations” and accounts for asset retirement obligations by
recording the fair value of its plugging and abandonment
obligations when incurred, which is at the time the well is
completely drilled. Upon initial recognition of an asset retirement
obligation, the Partnership increases the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time,
the asset retirement obligations are accreted, over the estimated
life of the related asset, for the change in their present value.
The initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of
the related assets, through charges to depreciation, depletion and
amortization. If the fair value of the estimated asset retirement
obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset
retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. Revisions in
estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated
inflation rates, escalating retirement costs and changes in the
estimated timing of settling asset retirement
obligations.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements - In May 2014, the FASB and the
International Accounting Standards Board issued their converged
standard on revenue recognition that provides a single,
comprehensive model that entities will apply to determine the
measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The
underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount
that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those
goods or services. The standard outlines a five-step approach to
apply the underlying principle: (a) identify the contract with the
customer, (b) identify the separate performance obligations in the
contract, (c) determine the transaction price, (d) allocate the
transaction price to separate performance obligations and (e)
recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is
satisfied. The revenue standard is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within that reporting period, and can be adopted under the
full retrospective method or simplified transition method. Early
adoption is not permitted. The Partnership plans to adopt the
revenue standard beginning January 1, 2018 and is currently
evaluating the impact that these changes will have on our condensed
financial statements.

In August
2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties About an Entity’s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, new guidance related to the
disclosures around going concern. The new standard provides
guidance around management’s responsibility to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability
to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote
disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Managing General Partner
is evaluating the income and cash flow statements to determine if a
going concern needs to be addressed.

 

In August
2016, the FASB issued an accounting update on statements of cash
flows to address diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts
and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of
cash flows. The update addresses eight specific cash flow issues
with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early
adoption permitted. The Managing General Partner of this
Partnership is currently evaluating the impact these changes may
have on this Partnership's financial statements.

 

NOTE 3 -
CONCENTRATION OF RISK

 

Accounts
Receivable - This Partnership’s accounts receivable are from
purchasers of natural gas production. The Partnership sells
substantially all of its gas production to a customer who purchases
from other Partnerships managed by the Partnership’s MGP.
Inherent to the Partnership’s industry is the concentration
of natural gas sales to a limited number of customers. This
industry concentration has the potential to impact the
Partnership’s overall exposure to credit risk in that its
customers may be similarly affected by the changes in economic and
financial condition, commodity prices and other
conditions.

 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership did not
record an allowance for doubtful accounts. In making the estimate
for receivables that are uncollectible, the MGP considers, among
other things, subsequent collections, historical write-offs and
overall creditworthiness of the Partnership’s customers. It
is reasonably possible the estimate for uncollectable receivables
will change periodically. Historically neither MDS nor any of the
other Partnerships managed by the Partnership’s MGP, have
experienced uncollectable accounts receivable. The Partnership did
not incur any losses on accounts receivable for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

 

NOTE 4 -
PARTICIPATION IN COSTS AND REVENUES

 

For the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, approximately $129,000 of gross
revenue from the sale of natural gas had been received or estimated
for approximately 85,000 MCF at an average price of $1.52 per MCF.
Royalties for this period were approximately $14,000. In addition
approximately $68,000 of gross revenue from the sale of natural gas
had been recorded as revenue as a result of the Partnership
estimating revenue not yet received, which is 55,000 MCF at an
average price of $1.24. These amounts are recorded as accounts
receivable net of royalties approximating $61,200. The total
estimate of expenses to be deducted from those amounts is
approximately $57,000, which are typically transportation, well
maintenance and lease operating expense.

 

For the
quarter ended September 30, 2015, approximately $137,000 of gross
revenue from the sale of natural gas had been received or estimated
for approximately 111,300 MCF at an average price of $1.23 per MCF.
This includes approximately $89,000 of gross revenue from the sale
of natural gas had been recorded as revenue as a result of the
Partnership estimating revenue not yet received, which is 73,800
MCF at an average price of $1.21. These amounts are recorded as
accounts receivable net of royalties approximating $9,000. The
total estimate of expenses to be deducted from those amounts is
approximately $66,000, which are typically transportation, well
maintenance and lease operating expenses.

 

NOTE 5 -
PARTNERS’ CAPITAL

 

The
Partnership Agreement provides that MDS shall review the accounts
of the Partnership at least monthly to determine whether cash
distributions are appropriate and the amount to be distributed, if
any.

 

The
Partnership Agreement provides for the enhancement of investor cash
distributions if the Partnership does not meet a performance
standard defined in the agreement during the first 8 years of
operations beginning the earlier of the first full year of
operation after all wells begin production or 12 months after the
final closing of the Partnership. In general, if the cumulative
distributions to the investors is less than 10% of their
subscriptions for years 1 through 5 and 7.5% of their subscriptions
for years 6 through 8, MDS will subordinate up to 60% of its share,
as MGP, of Partnership gross production revenues. As a result of
the trend of lower revenue per MCF that the industry is currently
experiencing, the MGP has subordinated 60% of it revenue interest
beginning in August 2014 and continuing through September 2016.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year
ended December 31, 2015, MGP subordinated $18,200 and $19,500,
respectively, which was distributed to investors. The MGP’s
share of expenses exceeds its share of revenue, due to the
subordination, thus, the MGP is not currently receiving
distributions and owes the Partnership approximately $37,000 and
$19,500 which is included with Accounts Receivable from Managing
General Partner at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
respectively.

NOTE 6 -
TRANSFERS AND PRESENTATIONS

 

There is
no established public trading market for the Partnership’s
units and the Partnership does not anticipate that a market for the
Partnership’s units will develop. The Partnership’s
units may be transferred only in accordance with the provisions of
the Partnership Agreement which require:

 




 



●



the MGP
may require an opinion of counsel that registration under
applicable federal and state law is not required;





 



●



the
transfer not result in materially adverse tax consequences to the
Partnership; and





 



●



the
transfer must not contravene any terms of the Partnership
Agreement.

assignee of a unit may become a substituted partner only upon
meeting the following conditions:

 




 



●



the
assignor gives the assignee the right;





 



●



the
assignee pays to the Partnership all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the substitution; and





 



●



the
assignee executes and delivers the instruments, which the MGP
requires to effect the substitution and to confirm his or her
agreement to be bound by the terms of the Partnership
Agreement.




 

A
substitute partner is entitled to all of the rights of full
ownership of the assigned units, including the right to
vote.

 

Investor
Partners may request that the MGP repurchase their units at any
time beginning with the fifth anniversary after December 31, 2013
provided that certain conditions are met. The repurchase price is
set at the greater of the partner’s share of (i)
predominantly 70% of the Partnership’s present worth of
future net revenues from the proved reserves as determined under
the last reserve report and is reduced by an amount equal to all of
the Partnership’s debts or (ii) an amount equal to three
times the total amount of distributions paid by the Partnership to
the participant during the previous twelve months. The MGP is also
permitted to adjust the purchase price under certain conditions for
changes occurring after the date of the presentment request.
Repurchase requests are fulfilled by the MGP on a first-come,
first-served basis and may not exceed 5% of the total units
outstanding. The MGP may suspend the presentment feature at any
time if it determines that it does not have sufficient cash flow or
it is unable to borrow funds on terms it deems reasonable. As of
September 30, 2016 the MGP has not repurchased any limited
partnership units.

Cause for
Change in Estimate – In December 2015, the MGP revised its
assumptions related to the cash outlay expected to be incurred to
plug the Partnership's uneconomic wells. The revision in the asset
retirement obligation did not have an immediate effect in the
current year statement of operations, as the increase in the
revised obligation will be accreted and the offsetting capitalized
amount will be depreciated over the useful lives of respective
wells.

 

The above
accretion expense is included in depreciation, depletion and
amortization in the Partnership’s statement of operations. As
of September 30, 2016 the Partnership’s estimate of the costs
to plug its wells was $60,000, which has increased from its initial
assessment at September 30, 2015 of $21,000 due to better data
available in regards to plugging of vertical Marcellus wells. The
Partnership’s asset retirement obligation is measured using a
discount rate of 5.57% and estimated useful lives of 1 to 20
years.

 

NOTE 9 -

the Partnership and is paid at competitive rates for these
