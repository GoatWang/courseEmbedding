ProVision Holding, Inc. (OTCQB: PVHO) Breaking News -
November 10, 2016
 

Procter & Gamble’s Pantene Brand Chooses Provision 3D Savings Center for Ad 
Campaign
 

Premier brand signs on for both 3D advertising and in-store promotion throughout 
Provision’s expanding retail network




CHATSWORTH, Calif., November 10, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Provision 
Interactive Technologies, Inc. ("Provision"), a subsidiary of Provision 
Holding, Inc. (OTCQB:PVHO), 
announced today that Procter & Gamble (“P&G”) (NYSE: PG) has begun a 
national advertising promotional campaign on Provision’s 3D Savings Center 
kiosks for its Pantene brand. The campaign will utilize the unique 3D 
holographic technology as well as in-store promotional coupons provided by 
Provision’s 3D Saving Center kiosks in retail locations across the U.S. 

Pantene’s new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers ‘superior 
conditioning without weight,’ addressing a significant consumer trial barrier in 
the category. Pantene shampoo and conditioner systems are consumer blind test 
winners vs. the best competition in North America, China and Japan. 

“We think the Pantene brand is a perfect match for our technology and for our 
national in-store network,” said Provision’s CEO, Curt Thornton. “We look 
forward to using our unique eye-catching technology to showcase Pantene’s 
classic brand. 
Pantene’s commitment demonstrates its confidence in Provision’s 3D in-store 
digital media platform to generate awareness of Pantene’s products at the 
point-of-sale.”

Provision’s award-winning, 3D Savings Center Kiosks generate extraordinary, 
three dimensional, holographic videos and has proven to generate a great deal of 
attention from retail customers. The 3D holographic display projects videos in 
front of the screen without the need for any special glasses and without any 
discomforting eye stress. 

Each kiosk also has a 2D interactive touch screen that provides consumers access 
to promotions, rewards, and coupons. The kiosks are also able to print coupon 
offers, allowing the retailer and other advertisers to offer customers highly 
effective sales influencers at the point of purchase. 

About Procter & Gamble

trusted, quality, leadership brands, including Always�, Ambi Pur�, Ariel�,

Total revenues were $5.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016, compared to 
$575,000 for the similar year ended June 30, 2015. Revenues are primarily 
related to sales of Provision’s 3D Savings Center kiosks for placement into

from $265,000 in the previous year. The Company also reported a net loss of $6.2 
million for the year ended June 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $0.8 million 
for the same period last year as the company incurred greater expenses related 
to the ramp-up of its network of kiosks installed in approximately 475 retail

("Provision"), a subsidiary of Provision Holding, Inc. (PVHO), is pleased to announce today that it has entered into an agreement with DB Dava, LLC ("DB") to launch a 3D network starting in a national pharmacy chain. Provision and a newly-formed entity named ProDava 3D, LLC will commercialize Provision's 3D holographic based kiosks (the "3D Kiosks"), commonly known in the market as "3D Reward Centers", in the U.S. retail market. Through the agreement the first 3D Kiosks will be placed in a national chain of retail pharmacies to display advertisements, promotions, sweepstakes, samples, coupons and other consumer-based retail programs.DB's capital contribution to the joint venture includes an investment of up to $50 Million in cash from investors including a company financed by a New York based investment firm; a leading, highly diversified global investment manager with approximately $60 billion of assets under management. The agreement calls for an immediate initial investment of $2 million into the joint venture from DB, and assigns the current value of Provision at $12.5 million. Provision's contribution to the joint venture includes Provision's know-how, management, and its agreement with the national retail pharmacy that will be the first target for the 3D Kiosk launch. Provision will be responsible for manufacturing, installation, service, maintenance, technical support, network management, advertising, marketing, and accounting of each 3D Kiosk for the joint venture. Provision will be compensated by the joint venture for rendering and performing all of these services under the terms and conditions of the agreement. The advertising and other revenues generated from the 3D Kiosks will be split between the members of the joint venture, pursuant to certain agreed upon terms of the agreement. The Joint Venture is purchasing 3D Kiosks, manufactured by Provision. These will be placed in high traffic aisles of nationally recognized retail stores with advertisements of consumer packaged products, other consumer goods manufacturers along with local/regional advertisers. Ad sales inventory will include marquee 3D hologram images, coupons, and other rewards and transactions of products sold in the stores (focused on new product introductions). Provision looks forward to planning deployment of several thousand machines over the next 24 months. With the funding in place for the nationwide rollout, annual revenue is forecasted to provide Provision with substantial resources to expand its 3D Kiosks to additional locations in the U.S., Asia, and Europe. "We are very excited by this new opportunity to work with DB, and especially with our new friends at DB Dava," said Provision CEO Curt Thornton. "We look forward to a successful future together."About Provision Interactive Technologies, Inc.Provision Interactive Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of the publicly traded company Provision Holding, Inc.
