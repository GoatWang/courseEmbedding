NOTES TO
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

 




1.



    Description
of Business




Mewbourne
Energy Partners 09-A, L.P., (the “Registrant” or the
“Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership engaged
primarily in oil and gas development and production in Texas,
Oklahoma, and New Mexico, was organized on February 26, 2009.
The offering of limited and general partner interests began
May 1, 2009 as a part of a private placement pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D
promulgated thereunder, and concluded August 28, 2009, with
total investor contributions of $66,210,000 originally being sold
to accredited investors of which $62,140,000 were sold to
accredited investors as general partner interests and $4,070,000
were sold to accredited investors as limited partner interests. The
managing general partner, Mewbourne Development Corporation
(“MD”), has no significant equity interest in the
Partnership.

 




2.



    Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies




Reference is
hereby made to the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10,
which contains a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Partnership in the preparation of its financial
statements. These policies are also followed in preparing the
quarterly report included herein.

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial
statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods
presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the
full year.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

On
April 20, 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-14,
“Accounting for Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas:
Amendments to Paragraph 932-10-S99-1” to make the definitions
in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 932-10-S99-1 consistent
with those in the SEC Final Rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas
Accounting”. The Partnership adopted the new standards
effective December 31, 2009. This update had no effect on the
Partnership’s financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

 




3.



    Accounting
for Oil and Gas Producing Activities




The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil
and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and
non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties
subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas
properties. At June 30, 2010, approximately $6.2 million of
capitalized costs were excluded from amortization. Proceeds from
the sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the
full cost pool. Gains and losses on the sale or other disposition
of properties are not recognized unless such adjustments would
significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and
the proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a
quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of
the present value of future net cash flows of proved reserves and
the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties.

    Asset
Retirement Obligations




The
Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future
plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on
historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is
discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to
the liability could occur due to changes in well ownership
interests, well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful
lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration
requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in
connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of
the well.

A
reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for well
plugging and abandonment costs for the six months ended
June 30, 2010 and the period from February 26, 2009 (date
of inception) through December 31, 2009 is as

    Related
Party Transactions




In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership.
Mewbourne Oil Company (“MOC”) is operator of oil and
gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc.
is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions
are with MD and MOC.

In
the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that
will be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will receive their portion of these costs
based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and
customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision,
pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which
will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in
accordance with the program and partnership agreements.

In
consideration for services rendered by MD in managing the business
of the Partnership, the Partnership during each of the initial
three years of the Partnership will pay to MD a management fee in
the amount equal to .75% of the subscriptions by the investor
partners to the Partnership. The Partnership will include the
management fee as part of the full cost pool pursuant to 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X.

In
general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall
not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership’s
gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production
during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating
costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000
plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general
partners.

Meet Our Founder


 


Curtis W. Mewbourne, a native of Shreveport, Louisiana, obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Oklahoma, where he has been honored as a Distinguished Graduate. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Army and working as a petroleum engineer in industry, he founded Mewbourne Oil Company in 1965. Mewbourne Oil is one of the most successful privately owned oil and gas producers in America. Mr. Mewbourne continues to operate the company privately.
In recognition of his longtime support, the University of Oklahoma named the Mewbourne School of Petroleum and Geological Engineering in his honor in May of 2000, and granted him the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 2002. On November 2, 2007, the Mewbourne College of Earth & Energy was named in his honor and he was given the Trailblazer Award for his professional achievements and lifetime commitment to the energy center.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
