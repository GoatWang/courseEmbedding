Jonathan Ebinger





















 Jonathan Ebinger (MBA ’93) is a general partner at BlueRun Ventures, a leading, early-stage venture capital firm that has helped finance and grow some of the biggest names in mobile, such as PayPal, the ubiquitous e-commerce site; Waze, one of the world’s largest community-based traffic apps, which is now owned by Google and has gained international popularity; and Topsy, a social search and analytics company recently purchased by Apple.What do you look for when evaluating an investment opportunity?It used to be three things: strength of team, strength of market and strength of technology. But in the last couple of years, I’ve added another attribute: The company has to matter. It’s just not worth it for me to spend time on another “me too” company. I want to work with entrepreneurs who are looking to change the world. It sounds cliché, but if we are spending our time and resources, we want it to be on something that’s going to make a difference.How would you define “making a difference” in your field?I’m not talking about social investing. I’m talking about improving productivity for a workforce, reducing prices for consumers, driving efficiency and so on. For example, one of our companies, Kabbage, provides loans to small businesses — like power sellers on eBay. We assess risk and credit in a different way than banks do and give loans in real time to small businesses so they can really grow. That’s also helping to grow the economy.What opportunities in mobile are you most interested in right now?We’re very excited about mobile health and about small data around m-commerce. As much as e-commerce is doing a great job, it’s still a fraction of the commerce that’s happening in physical places. And m-commerce is ideally set up to fill that gap. I think we’re really on the platform for another big step up in innovation.How do you navigate opportunities in a market as broad as mobile?We focus on real-time data, [which measures] real-time site traffic, the advertising rotation and commerce. So if [we’ve pitched a product] that doesn’t operate in real time, it’s easy for us not to look at it. Innovation is important to our firm so we can stratify opportunities and hopefully point entrepreneurs toward investors that are right for their businesses.Along with providing funding, how do you help entrepreneurs grow their businesses?A lot of times, it’s really about growing the top line. In my experience, that’s often about distribution. Also, product pricing is key. As companies get more and more credibility in the market, they can raise their prices. So, for some companies, giving instruction to the management team about constantly raising prices when they have a strong value proposition is important.When you’re not growing mobile companies, what are you up to?I recently wrote a screenplay about two young Wall Street guys who get disenchanted with their line of work, and they want to do something that’s more worthwhile. So they have an idea and they go out to raise money for it, and the business ends up being really successful, and they help a lot of people. It’s kind of a tongue-in-cheek story. I have some friends in Los Angeles who are looking at it. And I’ve put it through some screenwriting competitions.You’re a multitalented guy!You have to keep yourself busy.

All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
