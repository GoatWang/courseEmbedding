William "Bill" G. Kaelin Jr. is a professor of medicine at Harvard University. Kaelin is a 2016 recipient of the Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research. He also has won the 2016 ASCO Science of Oncology Award, and 2016 AACR Princess Takamatsu Award.[2][3] His laboratory studies tumor suppressor proteins.
He became Assistant Director of Basic Science at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center in 2008. His research at Dana-Farber has focused on understanding the role of mutations in tumor suppressor genes in cancer development. His major work has been on the retinoblastoma, von Hippel-Lindau, and p53 tumor suppressor genes.
His work has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, American Cancer Society, Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and others.[4]
Kaelin earned his bachelor's in math and chemistry at Duke University, and remained for his MD, graduating in 1982. He did his residency in internal medicine at Johns Hopkins and oncology fellowship at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. After deciding as an undergraduate that research was not a strength of his, at DFCI he did research in the lab of David Livingston, where he found success in the study of retinoblastoma.[1] In 1992, he set up his own lab at DFCI down the hall from Livingston's where he researched hereditary forms of cancer such as von Hippel-Lindau. He became a professor at Harvard Medical School in 2002.[5]
He is a member of the board of directors at Eli Lilly[5] and the Stand Up to Cancer scientific advisory committee.[6]
He was married to breast cancer surgeon Dr. Carolyn Kaelin (Scerbo) from 1988 until her death from cancer in 2015. They have two children.[7]

Dr. William G. Kaelin Jr. Elected to Lilly Board of Directors


INDIANAPOLIS, June 4, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has elected William G. Kaelin Jr., M.D. as a new member, effective June 4, 2012.  Dr. Kaelin, 54, is a Professor in the Department of Medicine at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Senior Physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Associate Director, Basic Science, at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center.  As a member of Lilly's board, Dr. Kaelin will serve on the science and technology committee and 
the finance committee. He will serve under interim election to fill a vacancy left by the retirement of Dr. Martin Feldstein and will stand for election by Lilly shareholders at the company's annual meeting in May, 2014.
"I am very pleased to welcome Dr. Bill Kaelin to the Lilly board. Dr. Kaelin's deep scientific knowledge and medical expertise will benefit Lilly shareholders and the patients who depend on us," commented John Lechleiter, Ph.D., Lilly chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Bill is a leading cancer researcher and has a clear appreciation of the importance of scientific research and of Lilly's commitment to the discovery and development of innovative medicines that make a difference for patients."
Dr. Kaelin received his medical degree from Duke University in 1982 and was a house officer in internal medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He went on to become a medical oncology clinical fellow at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. David Livingston, where he began his studies of tumor suppressor proteins. He became an independent investigator at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 1992 as a James S. McDonnell Scholar and became a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator in 1998. 
Dr. Kaelin's research interests have focused on tumor suppressor genes and the normal functions of the proteins they encode.  The long-term goal of his work is to lay the foundation for the development of new anticancer therapies based on the functions of specific tumor suppressor proteins.  His studies of tumor suppressor genes linked to hereditary forms of cancer have uncovered molecular pathways that are important in non-hereditary cancers and have accelerated the development of new treatments for kidney cancer.
Dr. Kaelin is an elected member of the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences and has served on numerous boards and committees, including the American Association for Cancer Research's Board of Directors and the National Cancer Institute Board of Scientific Advisors.  He has received many awards for his work, including the Canada Gairdner International Prize, the AACR-Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Prize for Cancer Research, and the Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.  Most recently, he was named co-recipient of the Scientific Grand Prize 2012 of the Lefoulon-Delalande Foundation.

William G. Kaelin, Jr., M.D.









A Howard Hughes Medical Investigator since 1998, Dr. Kaelin's research seeks to understand how, mechanistically, mutations affecting tumor-suppressor genes cause cancer.  His long-term goal is to lay the foundation for new anticancer therapies based on the biochemical functions of tumor suppressor proteins. His work on the VHL protein helped to motivate the eventual successful clinical testing of VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of kidney cancer. Moreover, this line of investigation led to new insights into how cells sense and respond to changes in oxygen, and thus has implications for diseases beyond cancer, such as anemia, myocardial infarction and stroke.

He obtained his undergraduate and M.D. degrees from Duke University and completed his training in internal medicine at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he served as chief medical resident. He was a clinical fellow in medical oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and later a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of David Livingston, during which time he was a McDonnell Scholar. 
Dr. Kaelin is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, the American Society of Clinical Investigation, and the American College of Physicians. He recently served on the National Cancer Institute Board of Scientific Advisors, the AACR Board of Trustees, and the Institute of Medicine National Cancer Policy Board. He is a recipient of the Paul Marks Prize for cancer research from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; the Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Prize from the AACR; a Doris Duke Distinguished Clinical Scientist award; the 2010 Canada International Gairdner Award; ASCI’s Stanley J. Korsmeyer Award; the Scientific Grand Prix of the Foundation Lefoulon-Delalande; the Wiley Prize in Biomedical Sciences; the Steven C. Beering Award; the AACR Princess Takamatsu Award; and the Science of Oncology Award from ASCO.
A Howard Hughes Medical Investigator since 1998, Dr. Kaelin’s research seeks to understand how, mechanistically, mutations affecting tumor-suppressor genes cause cancer. His laboratory is currently focused on studies of the VHL, RB-1, and p53 tumor suppressor genes. His long-term goal is to lay the foundation for new anticancer therapies based on the biochemical functions of such proteins. His work on the VHL protein helped to motivate the eventual successful clinical testing of VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of kidney cancer. Moreover, this line of investigation led to new insights into how cells sense and respond to changes in oxygen, and thus has implications for diseases beyond cancer, such as anemia, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

Research Abstract
The Kaelin Laboratory studies the functions of tumor suppressor proteins including the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), and a homolog of the p53 tumor suppressor protein called p73.  The laboratory uses a variety of molecular and cellular approaches to understand how, mechanistically, these proteins prevent tumor growth.  One long term goal of this work is to lay the foundation for novel anticancer strategies.  For example, one could envision the development of drugs that will selectively kill cells that lack a particular tumor suppressor protein or which will mimic a particular biochemical activity normally performed by a tumor suppressor protein.

ResearchFunctions of Tumor Suppressor Proteins
Our laboratory studies tumor suppressor genes and the normal functions of the proteins they encode. The long-term goal of this work is to lay the foundation for the development of new anticancer therapies based on the functions of specific tumor suppressor proteins. For example, it may be possible to develop a drug that mimics the behavior of a certain tumor suppressor protein, or to design strategies for killing only those cells in which a particular tumor suppressor protein has been inactivated, thus sparing normal cells.We are currently concentrating on the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB), and the p53-like protein p73. pVHL inactivation is common in several cancers including clear cell renal carcinoma. Our laboratory established that when oxygen is available, pVHL targets for destruction another protein called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Cells lacking pVHL, or starved of oxygen, accumulate HIF, which activates a cadre of genes that facilitate adaptation to hypoxia. We showed that downregulation of HIF is both necessary and sufficient for pVHL to suppress the growth of renal carcinomas in experimental models. This work motivated clinical trials of agents that inhibit HIF-responsive growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). At least one VEGF inhibitor will likely be approved for the treatment of renal carcinoma in 2005.Earlier work by our group showed that the binding of pVHL to HIF requires that HIF be hydroxylated on one of two proline residues. Preclinical data suggest that preventing this modification pharmacologically might be useful for the treatment of diseases characterized by impaired oxygen delivery, including myocardial infarctions and strokes.  In other research, we are studying tuberous sclerosis, a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by mutations of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. We recently discovered that TSC1 and TSC2, like pVHL, regulate HIF; we also found that another protein, REDD1, plays an important role in adaptation to chronic hypoxia by modulating the function of TSC1 and TSC2. The best understood function of the pRB protein is its ability to inhibit the E2F transcription factor. We discovered that pRB interacts with another protein, RBP2, which also has features of a transcription factor. Importantly, we showed that inhibition of RBP2 in cells lacking pRB induces some of the same changes observed following restoration of pRB function, including the induction of differentiation. We are now studying the biochemistry of RBP2 in greater detail.

His studies of rare forms of cancer have uncovered molecular pathways that are important in kidney cancer and have been targeted in several clinical trials.
Kaelin majored in math and chemistry at Duke University and then stayed at Duke for medical training. But his first stint in a lab was "horrible." "So I thought I was making the right decision to become a practicing physician," he says.
After an internship and residencies at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Kaelin moved to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to train in clinical oncology. For the first year, he treated patients; then he embarked on 2 years in a research laboratory to fulfill his board certification requirements and to give himself one last taste of laboratory life. But the lab closed down 4 months after he moved in. "I was getting sign after sign that laboratory research was not for me," he says.
By a stroke of luck, he landed in the lab of David Livingston, who was working on the molecular basis of retinoblastoma, the most common pediatric eye cancer. "Having just spent a year on the front line, taking care of patients with cancer, it was pretty clear that the only real hope for these people was to eventually have a more precise molecular understanding of cancer and to try to translate that knowledge into more effective therapeutics," he says.
In Livingston's lab, Kaelin isolated a DNA-binding protein, E2F, that promotes cell proliferation. E2F is normally kept in check by retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, pRB, which tightly regulates cell division. But when mutations prevent pRB from performing this function, cells divide unrestrainedly, triggering retinoblastoma.
Throughout his career, Kaelin has maintained this interest in the regulation of cell division. "But the field is relatively mature now, so we try to contribute where we can rather than getting sucked into just doing the next obvious experiment," he says.
In 1992, Kaelin set up his own lab down the hall from Livingston. Looking for a project, he read about the identification of the gene for von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Patients with this hereditary cancer may develop tumors in the kidneys, adrenal glands, or pancreas. And they often acquire tumors in the central nervous system that look like nests of blood vessels. Whenever Kaelin had encountered this rare condition, he had wondered if it involves an abnormal response to normal oxygen levels. As well as growing lots of blood vessels, the tumors sometimes produce erythropoietin, which stimulates red cell production. Thus, they behave like tissue that is short of oxygen.
Kaelin discovered that when oxygen levels are normal, the VHL protein helps mark another cellular protein, called HIF, for destruction. When oxygen levels fall, HIF is allowed to persist, so it can restore a healthy supply of oxygen by promoting blood vessel growth and stimulating erythropoietin production. But how does VHL know that oxygen is scarce and it should leave HIF alone?
For many years, scientists had been trying to understand how cells sense and adapt to changing oxygen levels. Kaelin's group discovered that when oxygen is present, HIF acquires a hydroxyl group (-OH). When there isn't enough oxygen to provide the oxygen atom in this group, HIF is not hydroxylated. Moreover, oxygen availability determines the efficiency of the hydroxylating enzyme. So HIF remains unadorned when oxygen is scarce, escapes being tagged by VHL (because the hydroxyl group serves as the binding signal), and survives to initiate blood vessel growth.
This discovery was surprising because hydroxylation had never been identified as a cellular signaling mechanism. But since Kaelin's finding was published in the journal Science in 2001, National Cancer Institute investigators have identified several genes in the human genome that are predicted to encode protein hydroxylases. "A major thrust of our laboratory now is to understand their functions and what their targets are," Kaelin says.
In 2002, one of Kaelin's postdocs noted that another hereditary syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, which produces widespread but benign tumors, shared some features with VHL disease. For example, he had observed that rodents with a mutated tuberous sclerosis gene are more like humans with VHL disease than are rodents with VHL mutations. The postdoc determined that mutations in the tuberous sclerosis gene, such as those that occur in the human disease, cause too much HIF to be made for various reasons. "That was a satisfying molecular explanation for the phenotypic overlap," Kaelin says.
Kaelin's work is already being translated into clinical medicine. His group determined that kidney cancer often involves nonhereditary VHL mutations that have the same effect as hereditary VHL mutations: overproduction of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), which both promotes blood vessel growth and stimulates erythropoietin production. Recently, the FDA approved the use of two VEGF inhibitors for treating kidney cancer.
The work on tuberous sclerosis led the group to demonstrate that, when kidney tumors lose functional VHL, they overproduce HIF. One solution was to inhibit a protein called mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), which regulates HIF synthesis. Now treatments for kidney cancer are combining mTOR inhibitors with inhibitors of VEGF and of HIF synthesis. "So I think we are starting to make a little dent in kidney cancer," Kaelin says.
Kaelin's group hopes to identify genes that complement or cooperate with VHL mutations to promote kidney cancer. They are also looking for genes that become essential when VHL function is lost, because inactivating the products of such genes would be another therapeutic strategy. "I'm hopeful that by having an even more complete molecular understanding of kidney cancer, we can help guide the next generation of clinical trials, which almost certainly will involve combinations of drugs that affect different molecular pathways that are important in kidney cancer," Kaelin says.
