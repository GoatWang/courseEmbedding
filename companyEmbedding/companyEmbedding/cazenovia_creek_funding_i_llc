Independent Accountants� Report on Applying Agreed-Upon Procedures




Cazenovia Creek Investment Management LLC
Caz Creek Tax Lien Fund, LLC (together, the �Company�)






� 


Re: Cazenovia Creek Funding I, LLC, Class A and Class B Series 2015-1 Notes





We have performed the procedures described below, which were agreed to by the Company, solely to assist the Company with certain information pertaining to the tax liens which we were informed are intended to be included as collateral in the offering of the Cazenovia Creek Funding I, LLC, Class A and Class B Series 2015-1 Notes (the �Notes�). The Company is responsible for the information set forth in the Initial Data File (defined below).��This agreed-upon procedures engagement was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.��The sufficiency of these procedures is solely the responsibility
of the Company.��Consequently, we make no representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or for any other purpose.


Unless otherwise indicated, the following definitions have been adopted in presenting our procedures and findings:






���


The term �compared� means compared to the information shown and found it to be in agreement, unless otherwise noted.��Such compared information was deemed to be in agreement if differences were attributable to rounding.



�




���


The term �recomputed� means recalculated and compared the result to the information shown and found it to be in agreement, unless otherwise noted.��Such recomputed information was deemed to be in agreement if differences were attributable to rounding.



�




���


The phrase �County Assessor�s Websites� means the listing of websites provided by the Company, included as Exhibit A attached hereto.



�




���


The phrase �Tax Lien File� means any file containing some or all of the following documents: Tax Certificate, Delinquent Tax Sales Receipt, and Temporary Tax Receipt for Delinquent Tax Sale, Request for Proposal to Bid, Wire Request Form, Bankruptcy Letter, and/or State Penalty Information.���The Tax Lien File, maintained and furnished to us by the Company, was represented by the Company to be either the original Tax Lien File and/or a copy of the original Tax Lien File.





�

I.���The Initial Data File and the Selected Tax Liens



On June 17, 2015, Guggenheim Securities, LLC, on behalf of the Company, provided us with an electronic data file containing certain information related to 40,652 original tax liens and subsequent tax liens purchased by the Company (collectively, the �Tax Liens�) as of May 31, 2015��(the �Initial Data File�).��We were instructed by the Company to randomly select a sample of 180 Tax Liens from the Initial Data File (the �Selected Tax Liens�).��A listing of the Selected Tax Liens is attached hereto as Exhibit B.


For each of the Selected Tax Liens, we compared the attributes listed below to the corresponding information appearing on or derived from a copy of the applicable Tax Lien File document(s). The Company indicated that the absence of any of the Tax Lien File documents noted below (the �Tax Lien File Documents�) or the inability to agree the indicated information from the Initial Data File to the Tax Lien File Documents for each of the attributes identified constituted an exception. The Tax Lien File Documents are listed in the order of priority until such attribute was compared.

For purposes of comparing Purchase Date for Selected Tax Liens in Florida, we were instructed by the Company to consider the Purchase Date to be in agreement if the Purchase Date on the Initial Data File and the Purchase Date on the Tax Certificate was within 14 days.


For purposes of comparing Rank for Selected Tax Liens indicated as a sub-lien (i.e., the �Rank� field in the Initial Data File contained a value of �S�), we were instructed by the Company to compare the parcel property information in the Initial Data File for such Selected Tax Lien to the parcel property information in the Tax Certificate for the corresponding Selected Tax Lien that was indicated as the original lien (i.e., the �Rank� field in the Initial Data File contained a value of �O�).


For purposes of comparing Assessed Value for Selected Tax Liens #88, #89, #96, #105, #111, #112, #116, #117, #121, #122, #127, #128, #130, and #132, we were informed by the Company that the Assessed Values were not available as of May 31, 2015.��As such, the Assessed Values were deemed to be zero.��These were not considered exceptions.


For purposes of comparing Assessed Value for Selected Tax Liens in Tennessee, we were instructed by the Company to use the �Total Appraisal Value� field found in the County Assessors� Website.


For purposes of comparing Interest Amount, we were instructed by the Company to recompute the Interest Amount (the �Recomputed Interest Amount�) as follows:��(A) for all Selected Tax Liens, except for Selected Tax Liens in New Jersey, multiply (i) Tax Amount by (ii) Current Interest Rate divided by (iii) the product of 12 and the number of months between Purchase Date and May 31, 2015 or (B) for Selected Tax Liens in New Jersey, multiply (i) Tax Amount by (ii) Current Interest Rate divided by (iii) the product of 360 and the number of days between Purchase Date and May 31, 2015. We compared the Recomputed Interest Amount to the �Interest Amount� field in the Initial Data File.


For purposes of comparing Penalty Amount, we were instructed by the Company to recompute the Penalty Amount (the �Recomputed Penalty Amount�) by multiplying the Current Penalty Rate per the State Penalty Information by the Tax Amount per the Tax Certificate.��We compared the Recomputed Penalty Amount to the �Penalty Amount� field in the Initial Data File.


For purposes of comparing Redemptive Value, we were instructed by the Company to recompute the Redemptive Value (the �Recomputed Redemptive Value�) by adding the Tax Amount, Overbid Amount, and Reimbursable Fees per the Tax Certificate, and the Recomputed Interest Amount to the Recomputed Penalty Amount.��We compared the Recomputed Redemptive Value to the �Redemptive Value� field in the Initial Data File.


For purposes of comparing Combined Redemptive Value, we were instructed by the Company to recompute the Combined Redemptive Value (the �Recomputed Combined Redemptive Value�) by adding the Recomputed Redemptive Value for the original tax liens and the Recomputed Redemptive Value for each of the subsequent tax liens affiliated with the original tax liens.��We compared the Recomputed Combined Redemptive Value to the �Combined Redemptive Value� field in the Initial Data File.


For purposes of comparing Combined OLTV, we were instructed by the Company to recompute the Combined OLTV (the �Recomputed Combined OLTV�) by dividing the Recomputed Combined Redemptive Value by the Market Value per printouts from the Cook County Assessor�s website provided by the Company or respective County Assessors� Websites.��We compared the Recomputed Combined OLTV to the �Combined OLTV� field in the Initial Data File.


The information regarding the Selected Tax Liens was found to be in agreement with the respective information on the Tax Lien File Documents, except as noted in Exhibit C attached hereto.


We were not engaged to, and did not, conduct an examination or review, the objectives of which would be the expression of an opinion or conclusion, respectively, on the Initial Data File. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion or conclusion.��Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.


The procedures performed were applied based on the methodologies, assumptions, and information indicated in the Initial Data File or provided by the Company, without verification or evaluation of such information by us; therefore, we express no opinion or any other form of assurance regarding (i) the physical existence of the Selected Tax Liens or as to the conformity of their respective characteristics with those assumed for purposes of the comparisons and recomputations described herein, (ii) the reliability or accuracy of the Tax Lien File Documents, or data and documents furnished to us by the Company which were used in our procedures, or (iii) the enforceability of an contractual provision in the Tax Lien File Documents.


The procedures performed were not intended to address, nor did they address:��(i) the conformity of the origination of the Selected Tax Liens to stated underwriting or credit extension guidelines, standards, criteria or other requirements, (ii) the value of collateral securing any such Selected Tax Liens being securitized, (iii) the compliance of the originator of the Selected Tax Liens with federal, state, and local laws and regulations,�or (iv) any other factor or characteristic of the Selected Tax Liens that would be material to the likelihood that the issuer or the asset-backed security will pay interest and principal in accordance with applicable terms and conditions.��The procedures performed were not intended to satisfy any criteria for due diligence published by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (�NRSRO�).


The terms of our engagement are such that we have no obligation to update this report because of events and transactions that may subsequently occur.


This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Company.��It is not intended to be and should not be used by any other person or entity, including investors and NRSROs, who are not identified in the report but who may have access to this report as required by law or regulation.
