Hygea Holdings Corp Secures $140 Million for Growth, Acquisitions




Adds 15 Locations, 35,000 Patients with Gemini Health Care 
      Acquisition






June 08, 2016 12:46 PM Eastern Daylight Time



DORAL, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hygea Holdings Corp (“Hygea”) announced today that on February 24th 
      2016 the Company and a consortium of US and international investment 
      banks agreed to terms in which the consortium is providing $40 million 
      in funding to Hygea, with an additional $100 million credit facility 
      available for the acquisitions of medical group practices and 
      independent provider networks. At the February 24th closing, 
      Hygea used proceeds from the funding to acquire MedPlan, a major South 
      Florida provider network.
    


      “Hygea’s new facility provided us with resources to realize significant 
      growth already in 2016. Hygea intends to continue to grow through 
      acquisitions, which will keep the Company in the vanguard of primary 
      care delivery,” said Hygea CEO and President Manuel Iglesias.
    

      Gemini Health Care, the parent company of MedPlan and MedCare Medical 
      Centers, will join the Hygea family with its 35,000 managed care members 
      and 15 medical offices in Miami-Dade County, bringing the total Hygea 
      locations to 30 medical offices in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, 
      Orange, Seminole, and Hillsborough counties, as well as in the greater 
      Atlanta metropolitan area.
    

      Mr. Iglesias added that “this acquisition makes us one of the largest 
      individual primary care providers in the Southeast. Part of our mission 
      is to offer a whole spectrum of insurance services, and this acquisition 
      allows us to contract with multiple insurance companies, instead of 
      being captive to one, so we can best serve our members.” Mr. Iglesias 
      said services are provided to members and patients who are covered under 
      commercial policies, Medicaid, Medicare, ACA, discount medical plans, or 
      are self-pay.
    

      Hygea offers extended office hours to patients and a fleet of buses to 
      transport those in need.

Hygea is a diversified healthcare holding company led by a team of nationally recognized industry innovators and leaders who represent many aspects of healthcare, from insurance and finance, to medicine and technology. We own physician practices, ancillary services companies (pharmacies, therapies and diagnostic facilities), independent physician associations (IPAs), and other medical service entities that provide seamless care to commercial, Medicare and Medicaid patients.

With a critical mass of physicians across 76 specialties, Hygea creates and owns management service organizations, or MSOs, under contract with Medicare and Medicaid HMO plans. Hygea currently manages over 190,000 members and patients through their Medicare Advantage at-risk contracts and provide care through our Integrated Group Practice as an improved delivery model.
Our business model applies best practices at every stage of healthcare delivery to reduce inefficiencies and improve patient care. As a result, we enjoy and share greater profits with our partner doctors than other industry participants. Most importantly, we do so by delivering quality medical care to the very people who need it.














Why choose Hygea


1
The Hygea model incorporates our competencies in conventional and managed care.

3

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale by the selling shareholders 
of their common stock.


The healthcare services industry tends to be fragmented and dynamic, consisting
of specialized and ancillary services firms that operate mainly on a regional
basis such as generalist management companies, information systems vending firms
that offer services ranging from simple EMR/PMS packages to complex billing and
management systems, Health Maintenance Organizations, and Managed Service
Organizations.  Due to the healthcare services market having a strong regional
bias, many competitors in one location may not be operating in other areas.
Management believes that the fragmented competition allows the Company the
opportunity to expand into new markets rapidly via targeted acquisitions.
 
The industry in which Hygea operates has no institutional provider
organizations. The Hygea integrated practice model combines three distinct
business verticals. The first business vertical is the Medicare Advantage
designated clinic system that only accepts Medicare Advantage patients with
significant presence maintained by Leon Medical Centers (Miami Dade County),
MCCI (Florida statewide), Pasteur Medical Centers (Miami Date County) and
Southeastern Integrated Medical (SiMed) Centers (Ocala and Jacksonville) The
second business vertical is the commercial market and fee-for-service Medicare
which is best represented in Florida by Cleveland Clinic (Florida statewide),
Mayo Clinic (Florida statewide) and Southeastern Integrated Medical (north
Florida). The third business vertical is comprised of small group practices that
will take a combination of both fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage patients;
these practices are usually not large enough to sustain all the components of
the Hygea integrated model.  Hygea combines all of the business verticals and
sees itself as payor neutral accepting clients irrespective of whether they are
commercial, cash or Medicare Advantage/Medicare fee-for-service. We do not
believe ancillary service firms are not in competition with Hygea as they do not
drive or attract patients but are more of recipient of referrals from these
three business verticals. In the State of Florida, the northern part of the
state is driven by a fee-for-service practice model while the southern part of
the state, has a much higher incident of managed care delivery model.


Company Description
We are the principal shareholder of Hygea Health owning 99.9% of Hygea
Health. Hygea Health has two principal areas of operations. The first is a
network of multidisciplinary integrated medical group practices ("Integrated
Group") with a primary care physician ("PCP") focus. The Integrated Group


 owns a
series of subsidiaries that provide industry related services and which support
the integrated group practice business model. The second focus is Palm Medical
Network LLC ("Palm Medical Network"), an independent physician network.  Under
Palm Medical Network, we have a series of medical service organizations ("MSOs")
that have entered "at risk" contracts with Medicare Advantage Health Maintenance
Organizations ("HMOs") throughout Florida.

Under the Integrated Group, we manage, own and are acquiring physician practices
that we incorporate into integrated multidisciplinary group practices. The
principal focus is the acquisition of primary care physicians, which includes
family practice, internal medicine, clinical cardiology and other primary care
concentrated disciplines. We began implementation of our provider rollout
strategy with an initial focus on the South and Central Florida markets. The
business plans provide for expansion into surrounding states in the Southeast in
2012 and then throughout the U.S. in subsequent years. In addition, we intend to
acquire specialty medical and ancillary healthcare service providers (including
diagnostic facilities, pharmacies, rehabilitation therapy practices, among
others) that will create community-based "medical malls" for more efficient,
more comprehensive and better patient care. The management services provided
include HMO contracting, physician recruiting, credentialing and contracting,
human resources services, claims administration, financial reporting services,
provider relations, patient eligibility and related services, pooled back office
and front office administration, practice management systems, electronic medical
record system, centralized billing, shared facilities, medical management
including utilization management and quality assurance, data collection,
management information systems and other services that provide scale
efficiencies.

Through the Palm Medical Network IPA (Independent Physician Association) our
Company has focused on building (i) multidisciplinary integrated medical group
practices with a primary care physician focus; (ii) healthcare management
service organizations that manage and coordinate the medical care of patients
enrolled in multiple managed care health plans (i.e., HMOs) and (iii)
integrating all aspects of this network with the requisite technology platform
that incorporates physician friendly electronic medical records and practice
management system services, including scheduling and billing capabilities.
Starting in 2009, we have commenced the acquisition process and management
contracting with a number of group physician practices including those within
the IPA's approximately 1,600 credentialed physicians. This continues to be our
organization-wide focus as we implement our business plan moving forward.

We also hold an interest in a medical software company that has deployed an
electronic medical records and practice management system ("EMR/PMS") across
multiple physician practices in Florida and the US. This system provides
integrated patient record management that is fully automated end-to-end. We have
allocated and deployed financial and technical resources to speed the continued
implementation and integration of EMR/PMS into additional Company-owned and
other physician practice groups throughout the U.S.

The development of our Integrated Group and our Palm Medical Network is subject
to a number of risks, uncertainties and obstacles.  These risks include our
inability to raise needed financing to maintain or grow our operations, the
erosion of our revenue stream as a result of competition, increased expenses
resulting from an increased regulatory atmosphere, the failure or delay of third
party payors to provide reimbursement for our services, healthcare claims
exceeding our reserves and our inability to locate or close acquisitions. If
these events are to occur, our operations may be negatively impacted including
our inability to generate additional revenue or maintain our current level of
revenue or increased expenses which may result in a decrease in our net income
or result in a net loss.
---

We are a Nevada corporation formed on August 26, 2008 as Piper Acquisition II, 
Inc.  We changed our name to “Hygea Holdings Corp.” on May 16, 2011.     

Our corporate headquarters are located at 9100 South Dadeland Blvd., Suite 1500,
