Arts and Crafts

Denver /
Upstairs Circus
Arts and Crafts
There’s a lot going on up there. Especially on the right-side. We’re pretty sure we all have monkeys on motorbikes whizzing around in them churning up all kinds of crazy ideas. We say: let’s embrace our circuses together and make a show of it.
—
Upstairs Circus is a social bar where people can gather together to create unique D.I.Y., art & design projects; think Maker Studio meets Hipster Bar. Upstairs Circus gives patrons the time, supplies, tutorials and assistance to make something amazing-  all they have to do is add a little of their brand of circus to make it spectacular!
Our goal at Upstairs Circus, beyond all else, is to inspire and empower creativity.
(That, and to make sure that the only thing tacky about the Upstairs Circus is our glue.)
So what are you waiting for? Come set your lions, tigers and bears (oh my!) free. Join the Circus.
At Upstairs Circus we bring a whole new meaning to “Team Building,” I mean, we’ve got hammers and nails, need we say more? In addition to team building, we also cater to business events like product launches, customer appreciations, off-site events, glorious holiday parties, media events and more.
