Our mission is to be problem solvers, a source of solutions and the go-to persons for all things financial. At HM Capital Management this is accomplished by providing fee-only investment advice from a team of experienced professionals that is always serving in the best interest of the client.




Close


Our Culture
At HM Capital Management we stress teamwork in everything we do. While individual creativity is always encouraged, we have found that team effort often produces the best results. While the old way may still be the best way, we encourage creativity and imagination because we are constantly striving to find better solutions to clients’ problems.
At HM Capital Management we regularly receive confidential information as part of our normal client relationships. To breach a confidence or to use confidential information improperly would be unthinkable. We understand times do change, but core professional ethics and values do not go into or out of fashion.
At HM Capital Management we believe personal modesty, social reserve, and deliberate absence of arrogance are characteristics of great professional cultures. HM Capital Management is a culture of strong individuals absent of egotism.
At HM Capital Management we believe the people at great firms work harder than their competitors-both longer, more demanding days and more days and nights each week. While producing more, they also insist on producing at the highest quality.  They take pride and find great meaning in what they and their firm can achieve for clients. The dedication of our people to the firm and the intense effort they give their jobs are greater than one finds in most other organizations.  We think that is an important part of our success.

Our History

Our History
HM Capital Management was founded in 2005 but its roots date back much further as its founders previously worked as a team at a major brokerage firm. The decision to form HM Capital Management was an easy one as our focus has always been to provide the highest level of professional advice on a fee-only basis with no products to sell. In short, we wanted to serve our clients as a legal fiduciary. This was no longer an option working at a brokerage firm and therefore the decision to start HM Capital Management was formulated.
Since inception, HM Capital Management has experienced considerable growth and has expanded in both professional expertise and client assets. In 2010, InvestmentNews recognized HM Capital Management as a “Top 40 Fee-Only Registered Investment Advisor” as well as a “Top 20 Fee-Only Emerging Registered Investment Adviser.”  In 2016 HM Capital Management was named in the Top Wealth Managers & Financial Advisors in St. Louis by AdvisoryHQ.com.  While such recognition is gratifying, our focus remains on providing unbiased, fee-only advice with our own corporate growth as a byproduct.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Mission & Core Values
Open


Our mission is to be problem solvers, a source of solutions and the go-to persons for all things financial. At HM Capital Management this is accomplished by providing fee-only investment advice from a team of experienced professionals that is always serving in the best interest of the client.




Close


Our Culture
At HM Capital Management we stress teamwork in everything we do. While individual creativity is always encouraged, we have found that team effort often produces the best results. While the old way may still be the best way, we encourage creativity and imagination because we are constantly striving to find better solutions to clients’ problems.
At HM Capital Management we regularly receive confidential information as part of our normal client relationships. To breach a confidence or to use confidential information improperly would be unthinkable. We understand times do change, but core professional ethics and values do not go into or out of fashion.
At HM Capital Management we believe personal modesty, social reserve, and deliberate absence of arrogance are characteristics of great professional cultures. HM Capital Management is a culture of strong individuals absent of egotism.
At HM Capital Management we believe the people at great firms work harder than their competitors-both longer, more demanding days and more days and nights each week. While producing more, they also insist on producing at the highest quality.  They take pride and find great meaning in what they and their firm can achieve for clients. The dedication of our people to the firm and the intense effort they give their jobs are greater than one finds in most other organizations.  We think that is an important part of our success.

Our History

Close
Our History
HM Capital Management was founded in 2005 but its roots date back much further as its founders previously worked as a team at a major brokerage firm. The decision to form HM Capital Management was an easy one as our focus has always been to provide the highest level of professional advice on a fee-only basis with no products to sell. In short, we wanted to serve our clients as a legal fiduciary. This was no longer an option working at a brokerage firm and therefore the decision to start HM Capital Management was formulated.
Since inception, HM Capital Management has experienced considerable growth and has expanded in both professional expertise and client assets. In 2010, InvestmentNews recognized HM Capital Management as a “Top 40 Fee-Only Registered Investment Advisor” as well as a “Top 20 Fee-Only Emerging Registered Investment Adviser.”  In 2016 HM Capital Management was named in the Top Wealth Managers & Financial Advisors in St. Louis by AdvisoryHQ.com.  While such recognition is gratifying, our focus remains on providing unbiased, fee-only advice with our own corporate growth as a byproduct.
