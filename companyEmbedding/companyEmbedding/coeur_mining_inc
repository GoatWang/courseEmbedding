History[edit]
Coeur Mining was formed in 1928 to mine silver in the Coeur d’Alene region of Idaho. The company was an important mine operator in northern Idaho for many decades and among others operated the Coeur d'Alene Silver Mine, the Coeur Mine and the Galena Mine.[5] Coeur sold its remaining assets in the region in July, 2006.[6] In the past 30 years, Coeur has acquired and operated mines in the US, Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and New Zealand and has had operating interests in mines in Australia. It has also held investments in various exploration and mining companies. For a short while, it even manufactured hose, duct and metal tubing. A short history of some of the key mines operated by Coeur is outlined below.[7] [8] [2]

1983: Coeur acquired Asarco’s operating lease on the Rochester Mine in Nevada. Production began in 1986 and the mine continues to operate in 2016.[9]
1987: Acquired a 50% interest in the Kensington Property in Alaska. The remaining 50% was purchased in 1995 and production commenced in 2010.[10] The mine continues to operate in 2014.
1990: Acquired the Fachinal property in Chile from a Chilean exploration company. The underground gold-silver Fachinal mine also known as the Cerro Bayo Mine was put into production in 1985[11] and closed in 2008. The Cerro Bayo assets were sold in 2010 to Mandalay Resources Corporation.[12]
1991: Coeur acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Callahan Mining Corporation.[13] This acquisition included the Galena Mine and the Flexaust Company, which manufactured flexible hose, duct and metal tubing. Coeur sold Flexaust in 1995.[11]
1993: Acquired an 80% operating interest in the Golden Cross Mine from Cyprus Gold New Zealand Limited. The mine is an underground and surface gold mine located near Waihi, New Zealand.[5] The mine was closed in 1998.[14]
1994: Coeur purchased controlling and operating interest in the underground gold-silver El Bronce Mine near Santiago Chile from Compania Minera El Bronce de Petorca.[11] The mine operated until 2001 when it was shut down and Coeur sold its interest in the project in 2002.
1995: Coeur and ASARCO placed their interests in northern Idaho mines (Coeur, Galena and Calday mines) into a new corporation, Silver Valley Resources Corporation.[11] The Coeur Mine was subsequently closed in 1998 and the Galena Mine continued to operate until 2006 when Coeur sold its interests in Silver Valley Resources to U.S. Silver Corporation.[6]
1999: Acquired the San Bartolome silver project in Bolivia from ASARCO. The San Bartolome Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2002: Coeur acquired the Martha underground silver mine in Argentina from Yamana Resources Inc.[16] Coeur operated the mine until September 2012 when it was shut down.[2]
2005: Acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to 20 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine in Australia as well as all of the silver production and reserves, up to 17.2 million payable ounces, at the Broken Hill Mine in Australia.[17]
2007: Acquired the Palmarejo project from Bolnisi Gold NL and Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation. The Palmarejo Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2013: Established Coeur Capital, Inc. to hold royalties and strategic investments.[18]
2016: Produced 14.8 million ounces of Ag and 358,170 ounces of Au.[19]

Operations[edit]
Kensington Mine is an underground gold mine located in the Alaskan panhandle about 75 km northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The Kensington property consists of 14,000 acres of mineral claims held by Coeur Alaska,[20] a subsidiary of Coeur Mining. Mining in the Kensington region first took place in the late 1800s and early 1900s and has occurred intermittently since that time.[10] Coeur acquired 50% of the Kensington property in 1987 and then 100% in 1995. After considerable exploration work involving option agreements with a number of different companies and a court case that contested permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers, the Kensington mine was finally put into Production on July 3rd, 2010.[10][2] The Kensington mine is an underground vein-style gold mine with several individual vein systems including the Kensington, Eureka, Raven, Elmira and Julian-Empire veins.[10] The mine uses the cut-and-fill or stope-and-fill underground mining method. In 2012, the mine produced 82,125 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.22 oz/ton and a total production cost of $1865/oz.[dubious – discuss] Reserves at the end of 2012 were just over 1 million ounces of gold.[2]
Rochester Mine is a heap-leach surface silver and gold mine located in the Humboldt Mountains near Lovelock, Nevada. The property consists of 9724 acres of mineral claims,[9] in the district of the historic mining town of Rochester, Nevada. Historic mining in the Rochester Mine area occurred from 1909 to 1935 and consisted of underground mining of high grade silver and gold veins. Coeur acquired the property in 1983 and restarted mining operations as a surface mine in 1986. Except for a three-year shut down from 2007 to 2010 due to low reserves and metal prices, the mine has operated continuously since re-opening.[9] The Rochester Mine produces ore from a conventional open pit operation, and from surface stockpiles of ore. The ore is processed using cyanide heap-leaching to produce silver-gold bars. In 2012 the mine produced 2.8 million ounces of silver and 38,066 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.55 oz/ton silver and 0.0047 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $14.05 per ounce of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 44.9 million ounces of silver and 308,000 ounces of gold.[2]
Palmarejo Mine is a surface and underground gold and silver mine located about 420 kilometers by road southwest of the city of Chihuahua in northwestern Mexico.[15] The property consists of over 12, 000 hectares of mineral claims encompassing several silver and gold veins systems. Small-scale underground mining for silver veins in the Palmarejo area has occurred intermittently since the early 1800s. [21] Coeur acquired the property in 2007 and mining commenced in 2008.[15] The Pamerejo mine produces ore from surface and underground operations that target a number of silver-gold vein systems. The ore is processed using flotation and cyanide leaching to produce silver-gold bars.[15] In 2012, the mine produced 8.2 million ounces of silver and 106,038 ounces of gold at a grade of 4.7 oz/ton silver and 0.05 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $19.26/oz of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 5.3 million ounces of silver and 665,000 ounces of gold.[2]
San Bartolomé mine is a surface silver mine located near the historic mining city of Potosi, Bolivia; a world heritage site.[22] Mining of silver and silver-tin veins from Cerro Rico, a volcanic mountain adjacent to Potosi, began in the mid 1500s and has been continuous for over 450 years. In the 1650s, Potosi was the largest city in the western hemisphere with 160,000 residents.[23] Today, up to 15,000 people make a living mining small underground silver-tin veins. The property consists of approximately 4,800 hectares of surface mineral claims that encompass gravel deposits or silver-bearing rock along the flank of Cerro Rico.[23] Coeur acquired the San Bartolome property in 1999 and began current mining operations in 2008. The San Bartolomé Mine involves free digging of mineralized gravels along the flanks of Cerro Rico. This material is processed in a conventional cyanide leaching operation using the Merrill–Crowe process.[23] In 2012, the mine produced 5.9 million ounces of silver at a grade of 4.49 oz/ton and at a total operating cost of $15.81/oz. At the end of 2012 reserves are at 109 million ounces of silver.[2]
Projects[edit]
As of January, 2014 Coeur Mining holds two main exploration projects: Joaquin in Argentina and La Preciosa in Mexico. [24]
Joaquin is an advanced stage silver-gold exploration project located in Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. Gold and silver mineralization was discovered on the property by Mirosal Resources in 2004. Coeur began exploring the property in 2007 under an option agreement and acquired 100% of the property from Mirosal Resources in 2012.[25] The property contains oxide and sulphide silver-gold mineralization in epithermal veins, breccias and stockworks hosted in acid volcanic rocks of the Deseado Massif; a well-known mineralized belt in southern Argentina. In January, 2013 Joaquin has a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 15.7 million tonnes at 128.9 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au and an inferred mineral resource estimate of 1 million tonnes at 100.7 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au.[25]
La Preciosa is an advanced stage silver-gold project located in Durango State Mexico. Coeur acquired the La Preciosa property through the acquisition of Orko Silver Corporation on April 16, 2013.[26] The property contains epithermal silver and gold veins and breccia bodies. As of July 26, 2013 La Preciosa had a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 51.9 million tonnes at 87.54 g/t Ag and 0.166 g/t Au and an indicated mineral resource estimate of 17.7 million tonnes at 66.31 g/t Ag and 0.106 g/t Au at a NSR cut off of $20.43/tonne.[27]

Coeur Capital, Inc. (Royalties and Investments)[edit]
Coeur Capital, Inc. was formed in 2013 to hold Coeur’s existing and future royalty and streaming interests along with its portfolio of strategic equity investments. In December 2013 Coeur Capital acquired Global Royalty Corp, a private company with royalty interests in mines in Mexico and Ecuador. As part of the acquisition, Mark Kucher, President and CEO of Global Royalty, joined Coeur Capital as the Managing Director.[28][29]
Coeur Capital holds a non-operating interest in the Endeavor Mine in New South Wales Australia. It acquired this interest in 2005 for $44.0 million and it entitles Coeur to all of the silver production and reserves (up to 20.0 million payable ounces) contained at the Endeavor Mine.[2] The company also owns net smelter royalties on the Cerro Bayo Mine in Chile, the El Gallo complex in Mexico, and the Zaruma Mine in Ecuador.[28][29] Coeur Capital also maintains shareholdings in a number of junior exploration companies for investment purposes. These include Hudra Silver, Pershing Gold, Commonwealth Silver, International Northair Mines, Silver Bull Resources, Soltoro, Caracara Silver, and Apogee Silver.[18]

Rochester Mine is a heap-leach surface silver and gold mine located in the Humboldt Mountains near Lovelock, Nevada. The property consists of 9724 acres of mineral claims,[9] in the district of the historic mining town of Rochester, Nevada. Historic mining in the Rochester Mine area occurred from 1909 to 1935 and consisted of underground mining of high grade silver and gold veins.

Reserves at the end of 2012 were 44.9 million ounces of silver and 308,000 ounces of gold.[2]
Palmarejo Mine is a surface and underground gold and silver mine located about 420 kilometers by road southwest of the city of Chihuahua in northwestern Mexico.[15] The property consists of over 12, 000 hectares of mineral claims encompassing several silver and gold veins systems. Small-scale underground mining for silver veins in the Palmarejo area has occurred intermittently since the early 1800s.

Gold and silver mineralization was discovered on the property by Mirosal Resources in 2004. Coeur began exploring the property in 2007 under an option agreement and acquired 100% of the property from Mirosal Resources in 2012.[25] The property contains oxide and sulphide silver-gold mineralization in epithermal veins, breccias and stockworks hosted in acid volcanic rocks of the Deseado Massif; a well-known mineralized belt in southern Argentina. In January, 2013 Joaquin has a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 15.7 million tonnes at 128.9 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au and an inferred mineral resource estimate of 1 million tonnes at 100.7 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au.[25]
La Preciosa is an advanced stage silver-gold project located in Durango State Mexico. Coeur acquired the La Preciosa property through the acquisition of Orko Silver Corporation on April 16, 2013.[26] The property contains epithermal silver and gold veins and breccia bodies. As of July 26, 2013 La Preciosa had a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 51.9 million tonnes at 87.54 g/t Ag and 0.166 g/t Au and an indicated mineral resource estimate of 17.7 million tonnes at 66.31 g/t Ag and 0.106 g/t Au at a NSR cut off of $20.43/tonne.[27]

Coeur Capital, Inc. (Royalties and Investments)[edit]
Coeur Capital, Inc. was formed in 2013 to hold Coeur’s existing and future royalty and streaming interests along with its portfolio of strategic equity investments. In December 2013 Coeur Capital acquired Global Royalty Corp, a private company with royalty interests in mines in Mexico and Ecuador. As part of the acquisition, Mark Kucher, President and CEO of Global Royalty, joined Coeur Capital as the Managing Director.[28][29]
Coeur Capital holds a non-operating interest in the Endeavor Mine in New South Wales Australia. It acquired this interest in 2005 for $44.0 million and it entitles Coeur to all of the silver production and reserves (up to 20.0 million payable ounces) contained at the Endeavor Mine.[2] The company also owns net smelter royalties on the Cerro Bayo Mine in Chile, the El Gallo complex in Mexico, and the Zaruma Mine in Ecuador.[28][29] Coeur Capital also maintains shareholdings in a number of junior exploration companies for investment purposes. These include Hudra Silver, Pershing Gold, Commonwealth Silver, International Northair Mines, Silver Bull Resources, Soltoro, Caracara Silver, and Apogee Silver.[18]

History[edit]
Coeur Mining was formed in 1928 to mine silver in the Coeur d’Alene region of Idaho. The company was an important mine operator in northern Idaho for many decades and among others operated the Coeur d'Alene Silver Mine, the Coeur Mine and the Galena Mine.[5] Coeur sold its remaining assets in the region in July, 2006.[6] In the past 30 years, Coeur has acquired and operated mines in the US, Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and New Zealand and has had operating interests in mines in Australia. It has also held investments in various exploration and mining companies. For a short while, it even manufactured hose, duct and metal tubing. A short history of some of the key mines operated by Coeur is outlined below.[7] [8] [2]

1983: Coeur acquired Asarco’s operating lease on the Rochester Mine in Nevada. Production began in 1986 and the mine continues to operate in 2016.[9]
1987: Acquired a 50% interest in the Kensington Property in Alaska. The remaining 50% was purchased in 1995 and production commenced in 2010.[10] The mine continues to operate in 2014.
1990: Acquired the Fachinal property in Chile from a Chilean exploration company. The underground gold-silver Fachinal mine also known as the Cerro Bayo Mine was put into production in 1985[11] and closed in 2008. The Cerro Bayo assets were sold in 2010 to Mandalay Resources Corporation.[12]
1991: Coeur acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Callahan Mining Corporation.[13] This acquisition included the Galena Mine and the Flexaust Company, which manufactured flexible hose, duct and metal tubing. Coeur sold Flexaust in 1995.[11]
1993: Acquired an 80% operating interest in the Golden Cross Mine from Cyprus Gold New Zealand Limited. The mine is an underground and surface gold mine located near Waihi, New Zealand.[5] The mine was closed in 1998.[14]
1994: Coeur purchased controlling and operating interest in the underground gold-silver El Bronce Mine near Santiago Chile from Compania Minera El Bronce de Petorca.[11] The mine operated until 2001 when it was shut down and Coeur sold its interest in the project in 2002.
1995: Coeur and ASARCO placed their interests in northern Idaho mines (Coeur, Galena and Calday mines) into a new corporation, Silver Valley Resources Corporation.[11] The Coeur Mine was subsequently closed in 1998 and the Galena Mine continued to operate until 2006 when Coeur sold its interests in Silver Valley Resources to U.S. Silver Corporation.[6]
1999: Acquired the San Bartolome silver project in Bolivia from ASARCO. The San Bartolome Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2002: Coeur acquired the Martha underground silver mine in Argentina from Yamana Resources Inc.[16] Coeur operated the mine until September 2012 when it was shut down.[2]
2005: Acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to 20 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine in Australia as well as all of the silver production and reserves, up to 17.2 million payable ounces, at the Broken Hill Mine in Australia.[17]
2007: Acquired the Palmarejo project from Bolnisi Gold NL and Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation. The Palmarejo Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2013: Established Coeur Capital, Inc. to hold royalties and strategic investments.[18]
2016: Produced 14.8 million ounces of Ag and 358,170 ounces of Au.[19]

Operations[edit]
Kensington Mine is an underground gold mine located in the Alaskan panhandle about 75 km northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The Kensington property consists of 14,000 acres of mineral claims held by Coeur Alaska,[20] a subsidiary of Coeur Mining. Mining in the Kensington region first took place in the late 1800s and early 1900s and has occurred intermittently since that time.[10] Coeur acquired 50% of the Kensington property in 1987 and then 100% in 1995. After considerable exploration work involving option agreements with a number of different companies and a court case that contested permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers, the Kensington mine was finally put into Production on July 3rd, 2010.[10][2] The Kensington mine is an underground vein-style gold mine with several individual vein systems including the Kensington, Eureka, Raven, Elmira and Julian-Empire veins.[10] The mine uses the cut-and-fill or stope-and-fill underground mining method. In 2012, the mine produced 82,125 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.22 oz/ton and a total production cost of $1865/oz.[dubious – discuss] Reserves at the end of 2012 were just over 1 million ounces of gold.[2]
Rochester Mine is a heap-leach surface silver and gold mine located in the Humboldt Mountains near Lovelock, Nevada. The property consists of 9724 acres of mineral claims,[9] in the district of the historic mining town of Rochester, Nevada. Historic mining in the Rochester Mine area occurred from 1909 to 1935 and consisted of underground mining of high grade silver and gold veins. Coeur acquired the property in 1983 and restarted mining operations as a surface mine in 1986. Except for a three-year shut down from 2007 to 2010 due to low reserves and metal prices, the mine has operated continuously since re-opening.[9] The Rochester Mine produces ore from a conventional open pit operation, and from surface stockpiles of ore. The ore is processed using cyanide heap-leaching to produce silver-gold bars. In 2012 the mine produced 2.8 million ounces of silver and 38,066 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.55 oz/ton silver and 0.0047 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $14.05 per ounce of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 44.9 million ounces of silver and 308,000 ounces of gold.[2]
Palmarejo Mine is a surface and underground gold and silver mine located about 420 kilometers by road southwest of the city of Chihuahua in northwestern Mexico.[15] The property consists of over 12, 000 hectares of mineral claims encompassing several silver and gold veins systems. Small-scale underground mining for silver veins in the Palmarejo area has occurred intermittently since the early 1800s. [21] Coeur acquired the property in 2007 and mining commenced in 2008.[15] The Pamerejo mine produces ore from surface and underground operations that target a number of silver-gold vein systems. The ore is processed using flotation and cyanide leaching to produce silver-gold bars.[15] In 2012, the mine produced 8.2 million ounces of silver and 106,038 ounces of gold at a grade of 4.7 oz/ton silver and 0.05 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $19.26/oz of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 5.3 million ounces of silver and 665,000 ounces of gold.[2]
San Bartolomé mine is a surface silver mine located near the historic mining city of Potosi, Bolivia; a world heritage site.[22] Mining of silver and silver-tin veins from Cerro Rico, a volcanic mountain adjacent to Potosi, began in the mid 1500s and has been continuous for over 450 years. In the 1650s, Potosi was the largest city in the western hemisphere with 160,000 residents.[23] Today, up to 15,000 people make a living mining small underground silver-tin veins. The property consists of approximately 4,800 hectares of surface mineral claims that encompass gravel deposits or silver-bearing rock along the flank of Cerro Rico.[23] Coeur acquired the San Bartolome property in 1999 and began current mining operations in 2008. The San Bartolomé Mine involves free digging of mineralized gravels along the flanks of Cerro Rico. This material is processed in a conventional cyanide leaching operation using the Merrill–Crowe process.[23] In 2012, the mine produced 5.9 million ounces of silver at a grade of 4.49 oz/ton and at a total operating cost of $15.81/oz. At the end of 2012 reserves are at 109 million ounces of silver.[2]
Projects[edit]
As of January, 2014 Coeur Mining holds two main exploration projects: Joaquin in Argentina and La Preciosa in Mexico. [24]
Joaquin is an advanced stage silver-gold exploration project located in Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. Gold and silver mineralization was discovered on the property by Mirosal Resources in 2004. Coeur began exploring the property in 2007 under an option agreement and acquired 100% of the property from Mirosal Resources in 2012.[25] The property contains oxide and sulphide silver-gold mineralization in epithermal veins, breccias and stockworks hosted in acid volcanic rocks of the Deseado Massif; a well-known mineralized belt in southern Argentina. In January, 2013 Joaquin has a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 15.7 million tonnes at 128.9 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au and an inferred mineral resource estimate of 1 million tonnes at 100.7 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au.[25]
La Preciosa is an advanced stage silver-gold project located in Durango State Mexico. Coeur acquired the La Preciosa property through the acquisition of Orko Silver Corporation on April 16, 2013.[26] The property contains epithermal silver and gold veins and breccia bodies. As of July 26, 2013 La Preciosa had a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 51.9 million tonnes at 87.54 g/t Ag and 0.166 g/t Au and an indicated mineral resource estimate of 17.7 million tonnes at 66.31 g/t Ag and 0.106 g/t Au at a NSR cut off of $20.43/tonne.[27]

Coeur Capital, Inc. (Royalties and Investments)[edit]
Coeur Capital, Inc. was formed in 2013 to hold Coeur’s existing and future royalty and streaming interests along with its portfolio of strategic equity investments. In December 2013 Coeur Capital acquired Global Royalty Corp, a private company with royalty interests in mines in Mexico and Ecuador. As part of the acquisition, Mark Kucher, President and CEO of Global Royalty, joined Coeur Capital as the Managing Director.[28][29]
Coeur Capital holds a non-operating interest in the Endeavor Mine in New South Wales Australia. It acquired this interest in 2005 for $44.0 million and it entitles Coeur to all of the silver production and reserves (up to 20.0 million payable ounces) contained at the Endeavor Mine.[2] The company also owns net smelter royalties on the Cerro Bayo Mine in Chile, the El Gallo complex in Mexico, and the Zaruma Mine in Ecuador.[28][29] Coeur Capital also maintains shareholdings in a number of junior exploration companies for investment purposes. These include Hudra Silver, Pershing Gold, Commonwealth Silver, International Northair Mines, Silver Bull Resources, Soltoro, Caracara Silver, and Apogee Silver.[18]

History[edit]
Coeur Mining was formed in 1928 to mine silver in the Coeur d’Alene region of Idaho. The company was an important mine operator in northern Idaho for many decades and among others operated the Coeur d'Alene Silver Mine, the Coeur Mine and the Galena Mine.[5] Coeur sold its remaining assets in the region in July, 2006.[6] In the past 30 years, Coeur has acquired and operated mines in the US, Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and New Zealand and has had operating interests in mines in Australia. It has also held investments in various exploration and mining companies. For a short while, it even manufactured hose, duct and metal tubing. A short history of some of the key mines operated by Coeur is outlined below.[7] [8] [2]

1983: Coeur acquired Asarco’s operating lease on the Rochester Mine in Nevada. Production began in 1986 and the mine continues to operate in 2016.[9]
1987: Acquired a 50% interest in the Kensington Property in Alaska. The remaining 50% was purchased in 1995 and production commenced in 2010.[10] The mine continues to operate in 2014.
1990: Acquired the Fachinal property in Chile from a Chilean exploration company. The underground gold-silver Fachinal mine also known as the Cerro Bayo Mine was put into production in 1985[11] and closed in 2008. The Cerro Bayo assets were sold in 2010 to Mandalay Resources Corporation.[12]
1991: Coeur acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Callahan Mining Corporation.[13] This acquisition included the Galena Mine and the Flexaust Company, which manufactured flexible hose, duct and metal tubing. Coeur sold Flexaust in 1995.[11]
1993: Acquired an 80% operating interest in the Golden Cross Mine from Cyprus Gold New Zealand Limited. The mine is an underground and surface gold mine located near Waihi, New Zealand.[5] The mine was closed in 1998.[14]
1994: Coeur purchased controlling and operating interest in the underground gold-silver El Bronce Mine near Santiago Chile from Compania Minera El Bronce de Petorca.[11] The mine operated until 2001 when it was shut down and Coeur sold its interest in the project in 2002.
1995: Coeur and ASARCO placed their interests in northern Idaho mines (Coeur, Galena and Calday mines) into a new corporation, Silver Valley Resources Corporation.[11] The Coeur Mine was subsequently closed in 1998 and the Galena Mine continued to operate until 2006 when Coeur sold its interests in Silver Valley Resources to U.S. Silver Corporation.[6]

Operations[edit]
Kensington Mine is an underground gold mine located in the Alaskan panhandle about 75 km northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The Kensington property consists of 14,000 acres of mineral claims held by Coeur Alaska,[20] a subsidiary of Coeur Mining. Mining in the Kensington region first took place in the late 1800s and early 1900s and has occurred intermittently since that time.[10] Coeur acquired 50% of the Kensington property in 1987 and then 100% in 1995. After considerable exploration work involving option agreements with a number of different companies and a court case that contested permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers, the Kensington mine was finally put into Production on July 3rd, 2010.[10][2] The Kensington mine is an underground vein-style gold mine with several individual vein systems including the Kensington, Eureka, Raven, Elmira and Julian-Empire veins.[10] The mine uses the cut-and-fill or stope-and-fill underground mining method. In 2012, the mine produced 82,125 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.22 oz/ton and a total production cost of $1865/oz.[dubious – discuss] Reserves at the end of 2012 were just over 1 million ounces of gold.[2]
Rochester Mine is a heap-leach surface silver and gold mine located in the Humboldt Mountains near Lovelock, Nevada. The property consists of 9724 acres of mineral claims,[9] in the district of the historic mining town of Rochester, Nevada. Historic mining in the Rochester Mine area occurred from 1909 to 1935 and consisted of underground mining of high grade silver and gold veins. Coeur acquired the property in 1983 and restarted mining operations as a surface mine in 1986. Except for a three-year shut down from 2007 to 2010 due to low reserves and metal prices, the mine has operated continuously since re-opening.[9] The Rochester Mine produces ore from a conventional open pit operation, and from surface stockpiles of ore. The ore is processed using cyanide heap-leaching to produce silver-gold bars. In 2012 the mine produced 2.8 million ounces of silver and 38,066 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.55 oz/ton silver and 0.0047 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $14.05 per ounce of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 44.9 million ounces of silver and 308,000 ounces of gold.[2]
Palmarejo Mine is a surface and underground gold and silver mine located about 420 kilometers by road southwest of the city of Chihuahua in northwestern Mexico.[15] The property consists of over 12, 000 hectares of mineral claims encompassing several silver and gold veins systems. Small-scale underground mining for silver veins in the Palmarejo area has occurred intermittently since the early 1800s. [21] Coeur acquired the property in 2007 and mining commenced in 2008.[15] The Pamerejo mine produces ore from surface and underground operations that target a number of silver-gold vein systems. The ore is processed using flotation and cyanide leaching to produce silver-gold bars.[15] In 2012, the mine produced 8.2 million ounces of silver and 106,038 ounces of gold at a grade of 4.7 oz/ton silver and 0.05 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $19.26/oz of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 5.3 million ounces of silver and 665,000 ounces of gold.[2]
San Bartolomé mine is a surface silver mine located near the historic mining city of Potosi, Bolivia; a world heritage site.[22] Mining of silver and silver-tin veins from Cerro Rico, a volcanic mountain adjacent to Potosi, began in the mid 1500s and has been continuous for over 450 years. In the 1650s, Potosi was the largest city in the western hemisphere with 160,000 residents.[23] Today, up to 15,000 people make a living mining small underground silver-tin veins. The property consists of approximately 4,800 hectares of surface mineral claims that encompass gravel deposits or silver-bearing rock along the flank of Cerro Rico.[23] Coeur acquired the San Bartolome property in 1999 and began current mining operations in 2008. The San Bartolomé Mine involves free digging of mineralized gravels along the flanks of Cerro Rico. This material is processed in a conventional cyanide leaching operation using the Merrill–Crowe process.[23] In 2012, the mine produced 5.9 million ounces of silver at a grade of 4.49 oz/ton and at a total operating cost of $15.81/oz. At the end of 2012 reserves are at 109 million ounces of silver.[2]
Projects[edit]
As of January, 2014 Coeur Mining holds two main exploration projects: Joaquin in Argentina and La Preciosa in Mexico. [24]
Joaquin is an advanced stage silver-gold exploration project located in Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. Gold and silver mineralization was discovered on the property by Mirosal Resources in 2004. Coeur began exploring the property in 2007 under an option agreement and acquired 100% of the property from Mirosal Resources in 2012.[25] The property contains oxide and sulphide silver-gold mineralization in epithermal veins, breccias and stockworks hosted in acid volcanic rocks of the Deseado Massif; a well-known mineralized belt in southern Argentina. In January, 2013 Joaquin has a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 15.7 million tonnes at 128.9 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au and an inferred mineral resource estimate of 1 million tonnes at 100.7 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au.[25]
La Preciosa is an advanced stage silver-gold project located in Durango State Mexico. Coeur acquired the La Preciosa property through the acquisition of Orko Silver Corporation on April 16, 2013.[26] The property contains epithermal silver and gold veins and breccia bodies. As of July 26, 2013 La Preciosa had a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 51.9 million tonnes at 87.54 g/t Ag and 0.166 g/t Au and an indicated mineral resource estimate of 17.7 million tonnes at 66.31 g/t Ag and 0.106 g/t Au at a NSR cut off of $20.43/tonne.[27]

Coeur Capital, Inc. (Royalties and Investments)[edit]
Coeur Capital, Inc. was formed in 2013 to hold Coeur’s existing and future royalty and streaming interests along with its portfolio of strategic equity investments. In December 2013 Coeur Capital acquired Global Royalty Corp, a private company with royalty interests in mines in Mexico and Ecuador. As part of the acquisition, Mark Kucher, President and CEO of Global Royalty, joined Coeur Capital as the Managing Director.[28][29]
Coeur Capital holds a non-operating interest in the Endeavor Mine in New South Wales Australia. It acquired this interest in 2005 for $44.0 million and it entitles Coeur to all of the silver production and reserves (up to 20.0 million payable ounces) contained at the Endeavor Mine.[2] The company also owns net smelter royalties on the Cerro Bayo Mine in Chile, the El Gallo complex in Mexico, and the Zaruma Mine in Ecuador.[28][29] Coeur Capital also maintains shareholdings in a number of junior exploration companies for investment purposes. These include Hudra Silver, Pershing Gold, Commonwealth Silver, International Northair Mines, Silver Bull Resources, Soltoro, Caracara Silver, and Apogee Silver.[18]

History[edit]
Coeur Mining was formed in 1928 to mine silver in the Coeur d’Alene region of Idaho. The company was an important mine operator in northern Idaho for many decades and among others operated the Coeur d'Alene Silver Mine, the Coeur Mine and the Galena Mine.[5] Coeur sold its remaining assets in the region in July, 2006.[6] In the past 30 years, Coeur has acquired and operated mines in the US, Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and New Zealand and has had operating interests in mines in Australia. It has also held investments in various exploration and mining companies. For a short while, it even manufactured hose, duct and metal tubing. A short history of some of the key mines operated by Coeur is outlined below.[7] [8] [2]

1983: Coeur acquired Asarco’s operating lease on the Rochester Mine in Nevada. Production began in 1986 and the mine continues to operate in 2016.[9]
1987: Acquired a 50% interest in the Kensington Property in Alaska. The remaining 50% was purchased in 1995 and production commenced in 2010.[10] The mine continues to operate in 2014.
1990: Acquired the Fachinal property in Chile from a Chilean exploration company. The underground gold-silver Fachinal mine also known as the Cerro Bayo Mine was put into production in 1985[11] and closed in 2008. The Cerro Bayo assets were sold in 2010 to Mandalay Resources Corporation.[12]
1991: Coeur acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Callahan Mining Corporation.[13] This acquisition included the Galena Mine and the Flexaust Company, which manufactured flexible hose, duct and metal tubing. Coeur sold Flexaust in 1995.[11]
1993: Acquired an 80% operating interest in the Golden Cross Mine from Cyprus Gold New Zealand Limited. The mine is an underground and surface gold mine located near Waihi, New Zealand.[5] The mine was closed in 1998.[14]
1994: Coeur purchased controlling and operating interest in the underground gold-silver El Bronce Mine near Santiago Chile from Compania Minera El Bronce de Petorca.[11] The mine operated until 2001 when it was shut down and Coeur sold its interest in the project in 2002.
1995: Coeur and ASARCO placed their interests in northern Idaho mines (Coeur, Galena and Calday mines) into a new corporation, Silver Valley Resources Corporation.[11] The Coeur Mine was subsequently closed in 1998 and the Galena Mine continued to operate until 2006 when Coeur sold its interests in Silver Valley Resources to U.S. Silver Corporation.[6]
1999: Acquired the San Bartolome silver project in Bolivia from ASARCO. The San Bartolome Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2002: Coeur acquired the Martha underground silver mine in Argentina from Yamana Resources Inc.[16] Coeur operated the mine until September 2012 when it was shut down.[2]
2005: Acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to 20 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine in Australia as well as all of the silver production and reserves, up to 17.2 million payable ounces, at the Broken Hill Mine in Australia.[17]
2007: Acquired the Palmarejo project from Bolnisi Gold NL and Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation. The Palmarejo Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2013: Established Coeur Capital, Inc. to hold royalties and strategic investments.[18]
2016: Produced 14.8 million ounces of Ag and 358,170 ounces of Au.[19]

History[edit]
Coeur Mining was formed in 1928 to mine silver in the Coeur d’Alene region of Idaho. The company was an important mine operator in northern Idaho for many decades and among others operated the Coeur d'Alene Silver Mine, the Coeur Mine and the Galena Mine.[5] Coeur sold its remaining assets in the region in July, 2006.[6] In the past 30 years, Coeur has acquired and operated mines in the US, Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and New Zealand and has had operating interests in mines in Australia. It has also held investments in various exploration and mining companies. For a short while, it even manufactured hose, duct and metal tubing. A short history of some of the key mines operated by Coeur is outlined below.[7] [8] [2]

1983: Coeur acquired Asarco’s operating lease on the Rochester Mine in Nevada. Production began in 1986 and the mine continues to operate in 2016.[9]
1987: Acquired a 50% interest in the Kensington Property in Alaska. The remaining 50% was purchased in 1995 and production commenced in 2010.[10] The mine continues to operate in 2014.
1990: Acquired the Fachinal property in Chile from a Chilean exploration company. The underground gold-silver Fachinal mine also known as the Cerro Bayo Mine was put into production in 1985[11] and closed in 2008. The Cerro Bayo assets were sold in 2010 to Mandalay Resources Corporation.[12]
1991: Coeur acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Callahan Mining Corporation.[13] This acquisition included the Galena Mine and the Flexaust Company, which manufactured flexible hose, duct and metal tubing. Coeur sold Flexaust in 1995.[11]
1993: Acquired an 80% operating interest in the Golden Cross Mine from Cyprus Gold New Zealand Limited. The mine is an underground and surface gold mine located near Waihi, New Zealand.[5] The mine was closed in 1998.[14]
1994: Coeur purchased controlling and operating interest in the underground gold-silver El Bronce Mine near Santiago Chile from Compania Minera El Bronce de Petorca.[11] The mine operated until 2001 when it was shut down and Coeur sold its interest in the project in 2002.
1995: Coeur and ASARCO placed their interests in northern Idaho mines (Coeur, Galena and Calday mines) into a new corporation, Silver Valley Resources Corporation.[11] The Coeur Mine was subsequently closed in 1998 and the Galena Mine continued to operate until 2006 when Coeur sold its interests in Silver Valley Resources to U.S. Silver Corporation.[6]
1999: Acquired the San Bartolome silver project in Bolivia from ASARCO. The San Bartolome Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2002: Coeur acquired the Martha underground silver mine in Argentina from Yamana Resources Inc.[16] Coeur operated the mine until September 2012 when it was shut down.[2]
2005: Acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to 20 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine in Australia as well as all of the silver production and reserves, up to 17.2 million payable ounces, at the Broken Hill Mine in Australia.[17]
2007: Acquired the Palmarejo project from Bolnisi Gold NL and Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation. The Palmarejo Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2013: Established Coeur Capital, Inc. to hold royalties and strategic investments.[18]
2016: Produced 14.8 million ounces of Ag and 358,170 ounces of Au.[19]

Operations[edit]
Kensington Mine is an underground gold mine located in the Alaskan panhandle about 75 km northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The Kensington property consists of 14,000 acres of mineral claims held by Coeur Alaska,[20] a subsidiary of Coeur Mining. Mining in the Kensington region first took place in the late 1800s and early 1900s and has occurred intermittently since that time.[10] Coeur acquired 50% of the Kensington property in 1987 and then 100% in 1995. After considerable exploration work involving option agreements with a number of different companies and a court case that contested permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers, the Kensington mine was finally put into Production on July 3rd, 2010.[10][2] The Kensington mine is an underground vein-style gold mine with several individual vein systems including the Kensington, Eureka, Raven, Elmira and Julian-Empire veins.[10] The mine uses the cut-and-fill or stope-and-fill underground mining method. In 2012, the mine produced 82,125 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.22 oz/ton and a total production cost of $1865/oz.[dubious – discuss] Reserves at the end of 2012 were just over 1 million ounces of gold.[2]
Rochester Mine is a heap-leach surface silver and gold mine located in the Humboldt Mountains near Lovelock, Nevada. The property consists of 9724 acres of mineral claims,[9] in the district of the historic mining town of Rochester, Nevada. Historic mining in the Rochester Mine area occurred from 1909 to 1935 and consisted of underground mining of high grade silver and gold veins. Coeur acquired the property in 1983 and restarted mining operations as a surface mine in 1986. Except for a three-year shut down from 2007 to 2010 due to low reserves and metal prices, the mine has operated continuously since re-opening.[9] The Rochester Mine produces ore from a conventional open pit operation, and from surface stockpiles of ore. The ore is processed using cyanide heap-leaching to produce silver-gold bars. In 2012 the mine produced 2.8 million ounces of silver and 38,066 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.55 oz/ton silver and 0.0047 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $14.05 per ounce of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 44.9 million ounces of silver and 308,000 ounces of gold.[2]
Palmarejo Mine is a surface and underground gold and silver mine located about 420 kilometers by road southwest of the city of Chihuahua in northwestern Mexico.[15] The property consists of over 12, 000 hectares of mineral claims encompassing several silver and gold veins systems. Small-scale underground mining for silver veins in the Palmarejo area has occurred intermittently since the early 1800s. [21] Coeur acquired the property in 2007 and mining commenced in 2008.[15] The Pamerejo mine produces ore from surface and underground operations that target a number of silver-gold vein systems. The ore is processed using flotation and cyanide leaching to produce silver-gold bars.[15] In 2012, the mine produced 8.2 million ounces of silver and 106,038 ounces of gold at a grade of 4.7 oz/ton silver and 0.05 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $19.26/oz of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 5.3 million ounces of silver and 665,000 ounces of gold.[2]
San Bartolomé mine is a surface silver mine located near the historic mining city of Potosi, Bolivia; a world heritage site.[22] Mining of silver and silver-tin veins from Cerro Rico, a volcanic mountain adjacent to Potosi, began in the mid 1500s and has been continuous for over 450 years. In the 1650s, Potosi was the largest city in the western hemisphere with 160,000 residents.[23] Today, up to 15,000 people make a living mining small underground silver-tin veins. The property consists of approximately 4,800 hectares of surface mineral claims that encompass gravel deposits or silver-bearing rock along the flank of Cerro Rico.[23] Coeur acquired the San Bartolome property in 1999 and began current mining operations in 2008. The San Bartolomé Mine involves free digging of mineralized gravels along the flanks of Cerro Rico. This material is processed in a conventional cyanide leaching operation using the Merrill–Crowe process.[23] In 2012, the mine produced 5.9 million ounces of silver at a grade of 4.49 oz/ton and at a total operating cost of $15.81/oz. At the end of 2012 reserves are at 109 million ounces of silver.[2]
Projects[edit]
As of January, 2014 Coeur Mining holds two main exploration projects: Joaquin in Argentina and La Preciosa in Mexico. [24]
Joaquin is an advanced stage silver-gold exploration project located in Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. Gold and silver mineralization was discovered on the property by Mirosal Resources in 2004. Coeur began exploring the property in 2007 under an option agreement and acquired 100% of the property from Mirosal Resources in 2012.[25] The property contains oxide and sulphide silver-gold mineralization in epithermal veins, breccias and stockworks hosted in acid volcanic rocks of the Deseado Massif; a well-known mineralized belt in southern Argentina. In January, 2013 Joaquin has a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 15.7 million tonnes at 128.9 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au and an inferred mineral resource estimate of 1 million tonnes at 100.7 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au.[25]
La Preciosa is an advanced stage silver-gold project located in Durango State Mexico. Coeur acquired the La Preciosa property through the acquisition of Orko Silver Corporation on April 16, 2013.[26] The property contains epithermal silver and gold veins and breccia bodies. As of July 26, 2013 La Preciosa had a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 51.9 million tonnes at 87.54 g/t Ag and 0.166 g/t Au and an indicated mineral resource estimate of 17.7 million tonnes at 66.31 g/t Ag and 0.106 g/t Au at a NSR cut off of $20.43/tonne.[27]

Coeur Capital, Inc. (Royalties and Investments)[edit]
Coeur Capital, Inc. was formed in 2013 to hold Coeur’s existing and future royalty and streaming interests along with its portfolio of strategic equity investments. In December 2013 Coeur Capital acquired Global Royalty Corp, a private company with royalty interests in mines in Mexico and Ecuador. As part of the acquisition, Mark Kucher, President and CEO of Global Royalty, joined Coeur Capital as the Managing Director.[28][29]
Coeur Capital holds a non-operating interest in the Endeavor Mine in New South Wales Australia. It acquired this interest in 2005 for $44.0 million and it entitles Coeur to all of the silver production and reserves (up to 20.0 million payable ounces) contained at the Endeavor Mine.[2] The company also owns net smelter royalties on the Cerro Bayo Mine in Chile, the El Gallo complex in Mexico, and the Zaruma Mine in Ecuador.[28][29] Coeur Capital also maintains shareholdings in a number of junior exploration companies for investment purposes. These include Hudra Silver, Pershing Gold, Commonwealth Silver, International Northair Mines, Silver Bull Resources, Soltoro, Caracara Silver, and Apogee Silver.[18]

History[edit]
Coeur Mining was formed in 1928 to mine silver in the Coeur d’Alene region of Idaho. The company was an important mine operator in northern Idaho for many decades and among others operated the Coeur d'Alene Silver Mine, the Coeur Mine and the Galena Mine.[5] Coeur sold its remaining assets in the region in July, 2006.[6] In the past 30 years, Coeur has acquired and operated mines in the US, Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and New Zealand and has had operating interests in mines in Australia. It has also held investments in various exploration and mining companies. For a short while, it even manufactured hose, duct and metal tubing. A short history of some of the key mines operated by Coeur is outlined below.[7] [8] [2]

1983: Coeur acquired Asarco’s operating lease on the Rochester Mine in Nevada. Production began in 1986 and the mine continues to operate in 2016.[9]
1987: Acquired a 50% interest in the Kensington Property in Alaska. The remaining 50% was purchased in 1995 and production commenced in 2010.[10] The mine continues to operate in 2014.
1990: Acquired the Fachinal property in Chile from a Chilean exploration company. The underground gold-silver Fachinal mine also known as the Cerro Bayo Mine was put into production in 1985[11] and closed in 2008. The Cerro Bayo assets were sold in 2010 to Mandalay Resources Corporation.[12]
1991: Coeur acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Callahan Mining Corporation.[13] This acquisition included the Galena Mine and the Flexaust Company, which manufactured flexible hose, duct and metal tubing. Coeur sold Flexaust in 1995.[11]
1993: Acquired an 80% operating interest in the Golden Cross Mine from Cyprus Gold New Zealand Limited. The mine is an underground and surface gold mine located near Waihi, New Zealand.[5] The mine was closed in 1998.[14]
1994: Coeur purchased controlling and operating interest in the underground gold-silver El Bronce Mine near Santiago Chile from Compania Minera El Bronce de Petorca.[11] The mine operated until 2001 when it was shut down and Coeur sold its interest in the project in 2002.
1995: Coeur and ASARCO placed their interests in northern Idaho mines (Coeur, Galena and Calday mines) into a new corporation, Silver Valley Resources Corporation.[11] The Coeur Mine was subsequently closed in 1998 and the Galena Mine continued to operate until 2006 when Coeur sold its interests in Silver Valley Resources to U.S. Silver Corporation.[6]
1999: Acquired the San Bartolome silver project in Bolivia from ASARCO. The San Bartolome Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2002: Coeur acquired the Martha underground silver mine in Argentina from Yamana Resources Inc.[16] Coeur operated the mine until September 2012 when it was shut down.[2]
2005: Acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to 20 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine in Australia as well as all of the silver production and reserves, up to 17.2 million payable ounces, at the Broken Hill Mine in Australia.[17]
2007: Acquired the Palmarejo project from Bolnisi Gold NL and Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation. The Palmarejo Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2013: Established Coeur Capital, Inc. to hold royalties and strategic investments.[18]
2016: Produced 14.8 million ounces of Ag and 358,170 ounces of Au.[19]

Operations[edit]
Kensington Mine is an underground gold mine located in the Alaskan panhandle about 75 km northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The Kensington property consists of 14,000 acres of mineral claims held by Coeur Alaska,[20] a subsidiary of Coeur Mining. Mining in the Kensington region first took place in the late 1800s and early 1900s and has occurred intermittently since that time.[10] Coeur acquired 50% of the Kensington property in 1987 and then 100% in 1995. After considerable exploration work involving option agreements with a number of different companies and a court case that contested permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers, the Kensington mine was finally put into Production on July 3rd, 2010.[10][2] The Kensington mine is an underground vein-style gold mine with several individual vein systems including the Kensington, Eureka, Raven, Elmira and Julian-Empire veins.[10] The mine uses the cut-and-fill or stope-and-fill underground mining method. In 2012, the mine produced 82,125 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.22 oz/ton and a total production cost of $1865/oz.[dubious – discuss] Reserves at the end of 2012 were just over 1 million ounces of gold.[2]
Rochester Mine is a heap-leach surface silver and gold mine located in the Humboldt Mountains near Lovelock, Nevada. The property consists of 9724 acres of mineral claims,[9] in the district of the historic mining town of Rochester, Nevada. Historic mining in the Rochester Mine area occurred from 1909 to 1935 and consisted of underground mining of high grade silver and gold veins. Coeur acquired the property in 1983 and restarted mining operations as a surface mine in 1986. Except for a three-year shut down from 2007 to 2010 due to low reserves and metal prices, the mine has operated continuously since re-opening.[9] The Rochester Mine produces ore from a conventional open pit operation, and from surface stockpiles of ore. The ore is processed using cyanide heap-leaching to produce silver-gold bars. In 2012 the mine produced 2.8 million ounces of silver and 38,066 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.55 oz/ton silver and 0.0047 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $14.05 per ounce of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 44.9 million ounces of silver and 308,000 ounces of gold.[2]
Palmarejo Mine is a surface and underground gold and silver mine located about 420 kilometers by road southwest of the city of Chihuahua in northwestern Mexico.[15] The property consists of over 12, 000 hectares of mineral claims encompassing several silver and gold veins systems. Small-scale underground mining for silver veins in the Palmarejo area has occurred intermittently since the early 1800s. [21] Coeur acquired the property in 2007 and mining commenced in 2008.[15] The Pamerejo mine produces ore from surface and underground operations that target a number of silver-gold vein systems. The ore is processed using flotation and cyanide leaching to produce silver-gold bars.[15] In 2012, the mine produced 8.2 million ounces of silver and 106,038 ounces of gold at a grade of 4.7 oz/ton silver and 0.05 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $19.26/oz of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 5.3 million ounces of silver and 665,000 ounces of gold.[2]
San Bartolomé mine is a surface silver mine located near the historic mining city of Potosi, Bolivia; a world heritage site.[22] Mining of silver and silver-tin veins from Cerro Rico, a volcanic mountain adjacent to Potosi, began in the mid 1500s and has been continuous for over 450 years. In the 1650s, Potosi was the largest city in the western hemisphere with 160,000 residents.[23] Today, up to 15,000 people make a living mining small underground silver-tin veins. The property consists of approximately 4,800 hectares of surface mineral claims that encompass gravel deposits or silver-bearing rock along the flank of Cerro Rico.[23] Coeur acquired the San Bartolome property in 1999 and began current mining operations in 2008. The San Bartolomé Mine involves free digging of mineralized gravels along the flanks of Cerro Rico. This material is processed in a conventional cyanide leaching operation using the Merrill–Crowe process.[23] In 2012, the mine produced 5.9 million ounces of silver at a grade of 4.49 oz/ton and at a total operating cost of $15.81/oz. At the end of 2012 reserves are at 109 million ounces of silver.[2]
Projects[edit]
As of January, 2014 Coeur Mining holds two main exploration projects: Joaquin in Argentina and La Preciosa in Mexico. [24]
Joaquin is an advanced stage silver-gold exploration project located in Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. Gold and silver mineralization was discovered on the property by Mirosal Resources in 2004. Coeur began exploring the property in 2007 under an option agreement and acquired 100% of the property from Mirosal Resources in 2012.[25] The property contains oxide and sulphide silver-gold mineralization in epithermal veins, breccias and stockworks hosted in acid volcanic rocks of the Deseado Massif; a well-known mineralized belt in southern Argentina. In January, 2013 Joaquin has a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 15.7 million tonnes at 128.9 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au and an inferred mineral resource estimate of 1 million tonnes at 100.7 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au.[25]
La Preciosa is an advanced stage silver-gold project located in Durango State Mexico. Coeur acquired the La Preciosa property through the acquisition of Orko Silver Corporation on April 16, 2013.[26] The property contains epithermal silver and gold veins and breccia bodies. As of July 26, 2013 La Preciosa had a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 51.9 million tonnes at 87.54 g/t Ag and 0.166 g/t Au and an indicated mineral resource estimate of 17.7 million tonnes at 66.31 g/t Ag and 0.106 g/t Au at a NSR cut off of $20.43/tonne.[27]

Coeur Capital, Inc. (Royalties and Investments)[edit]
Coeur Capital, Inc. was formed in 2013 to hold Coeur’s existing and future royalty and streaming interests along with its portfolio of strategic equity investments. In December 2013 Coeur Capital acquired Global Royalty Corp, a private company with royalty interests in mines in Mexico and Ecuador. As part of the acquisition, Mark Kucher, President and CEO of Global Royalty, joined Coeur Capital as the Managing Director.[28][29]
Coeur Capital holds a non-operating interest in the Endeavor Mine in New South Wales Australia. It acquired this interest in 2005 for $44.0 million and it entitles Coeur to all of the silver production and reserves (up to 20.0 million payable ounces) contained at the Endeavor Mine.[2] The company also owns net smelter royalties on the Cerro Bayo Mine in Chile, the El Gallo complex in Mexico, and the Zaruma Mine in Ecuador.[28][29] Coeur Capital also maintains shareholdings in a number of junior exploration companies for investment purposes. These include Hudra Silver, Pershing Gold, Commonwealth Silver, International Northair Mines, Silver Bull Resources, Soltoro, Caracara Silver, and Apogee Silver.[18]

Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for Coeur Mining Inc.
Coeur Mining is transforming, which means it's also the best time for you to consider the stock.











                Neha Chamaria
            

                (Nehams)



            
            Jun 27, 2017 at 12:07PM
            
            





It's become a new normal for Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE) shares to take a hit after earnings releases. The stock tanked after the silver and gold producer released its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2016 numbers in early February, and then they fell a bit more after the first-quarter release in April. Year to date, Coeur is down 25%, as of this writing.
But why is the market punishing a company that ended 2016 with record production, is striving to cut costs, and appears to be on its way to another record year? Coeur is in a transformational phase, and there's perhaps no better time to consider a stock than when a company is turning around. Here are just some of the things that Coeur is doing right and that could propel its shares higher in the near future.
Tapping additional sources of income
After ending fiscal 2016 with a production record of 36.3 million silver equivalent ounces (SEO), Coeur now expects its SEO to rise to roughly 39.6 million ounces at the midpoint this year. Nearly half of that production growth is expected to come from Coeur's largest multiple-mine complex, Palmarejo in Mexico, which is in the midst of a major expansion phase. Palmarejo should bring in money for Coeur in two ways -- higher production, and the income from its renewed gold streaming agreement with Franco-Nevada Corp. (NYSE:FNV).

Franco-Nevada is a precious-metals streaming and royalty company that buys metal streams from pure miners like Coeur at low costs, in exchange for funding the miners upfront. Last year, Coeur and Franco-Nevada renewed their agreement under which Franco-Nevada buys 50% of the gold produced from Palmarejo at $800 an ounce. That's almost twice the amount Franco-Nevada was paying Coeur under its old agreement. Coeur made its first gold sale to Franco-Nevada under the new agreement in Q4 2016. In fact, Coeur's Q4 cash flows took a hit because of higher inventory, as it retained gold to sell later to the streaming company -- a fact that investors chose to overlook.
While banking on such streaming and royalty agreements for a steady flow of income, Coeur is focused on increasing its reserves. In line with those goals, Coeur has outlined an exploration budget of $40 million this year, compared with the $25.8 million it spent in fiscal 2016. Aside from Palmarejo, two other key mines Coeur is ramping up are Rochester, in Nevada, and Kensington, in Alaska.
Of course, Coeur isn't the only miner expanding its business -- Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL) is among its peers growing at a strong pace, hitting record production levels and reducing costs. But Coeur stands out for two reasons: the way it's redefining its portfolio in terms of metal and geographic mix, and moves that ensure long-term benefits.
Strengthening its product and geographic mix
You probably know Coeur as a silver producer, but you'd be surprised to know that the company has changed its product mix so dramatically in recent years that 63% of its revenue came from gold last year, versus only 31% in 2010. That was all part of a well-planned strategy that involved a shift toward the yellow metal and the lucrative streaming agreement from Franco-Nevada.

Image source: Coeur Mining.

At the same time, Coeur operates in one of the safest geographic regions, with 64% of revenue originating in the U.S. last year, versus only 15% in 2010. Again, this improved geographic mix positions Coeur better than its rivals. Tahoe Resources (NYSE:TAHO), for example, operates primarily out of the higher-risk nation of Guatemala.





Improving mining technique to cut costs
There's another area where Coeur has made significant progress in recent quarters: the transition from open-pit mining to 100% underground mining, which translates into higher metal recovery rates and production at lower costs.
Coeur is focused on two key growth areas: production and costs. While I've already elaborated on what it's doing on the production front, Coeur also cut down its all-in-sustaining costs by 6% year over year to $13.65 per ounce of silver in Q1. Coeur's full-year costs could be slightly higher because of lower production from its Wharf mine in South Dakota, but its costs should trend down as its ongoing expansion projects start adding to its top line.
Foolish takeaway: Solid growth potential ahead
Coeur CEO Mitchell J. Krebs perfectly summed up 2016 during the company's Q4 earnings call, when he referred to the year as "a key inflection point for Coeur." Palmarejo could be a game-changer, as it has the potential to push Coeur's production and cash flows substantially higher in the near future. Given its growth catalysts and the fact that Coeur is already generating strong operating and free cash flow, a current price-to-cash flow of 8.5 looks like a bargain right now for investors with a long-term view.

History[edit]
Coeur Mining was formed in 1928 to mine silver in the Coeur d’Alene region of Idaho. The company was an important mine operator in northern Idaho for many decades and among others operated the Coeur d'Alene Silver Mine, the Coeur Mine and the Galena Mine.[5] Coeur sold its remaining assets in the region in July, 2006.[6] In the past 30 years, Coeur has acquired and operated mines in the US, Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and New Zealand and has had operating interests in mines in Australia. It has also held investments in various exploration and mining companies. For a short while, it even manufactured hose, duct and metal tubing. A short history of some of the key mines operated by Coeur is outlined below.[7] [8] [2]

1983: Coeur acquired Asarco’s operating lease on the Rochester Mine in Nevada. Production began in 1986 and the mine continues to operate in 2016.[9]
1987: Acquired a 50% interest in the Kensington Property in Alaska. The remaining 50% was purchased in 1995 and production commenced in 2010.[10] The mine continues to operate in 2014.
1990: Acquired the Fachinal property in Chile from a Chilean exploration company. The underground gold-silver Fachinal mine also known as the Cerro Bayo Mine was put into production in 1985[11] and closed in 2008. The Cerro Bayo assets were sold in 2010 to Mandalay Resources Corporation.[12]
1991: Coeur acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Callahan Mining Corporation.[13] This acquisition included the Galena Mine and the Flexaust Company, which manufactured flexible hose, duct and metal tubing. Coeur sold Flexaust in 1995.[11]
1993: Acquired an 80% operating interest in the Golden Cross Mine from Cyprus Gold New Zealand Limited. The mine is an underground and surface gold mine located near Waihi, New Zealand.[5] The mine was closed in 1998.[14]
1994: Coeur purchased controlling and operating interest in the underground gold-silver El Bronce Mine near Santiago Chile from Compania Minera El Bronce de Petorca.[11] The mine operated until 2001 when it was shut down and Coeur sold its interest in the project in 2002.
1995: Coeur and ASARCO placed their interests in northern Idaho mines (Coeur, Galena and Calday mines) into a new corporation, Silver Valley Resources Corporation.[11] The Coeur Mine was subsequently closed in 1998 and the Galena Mine continued to operate until 2006 when Coeur sold its interests in Silver Valley Resources to U.S. Silver Corporation.[6]
1999: Acquired the San Bartolome silver project in Bolivia from ASARCO. The San Bartolome Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2002: Coeur acquired the Martha underground silver mine in Argentina from Yamana Resources Inc.[16] Coeur operated the mine until September 2012 when it was shut down.[2]
2005: Acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to 20 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine in Australia as well as all of the silver production and reserves, up to 17.2 million payable ounces, at the Broken Hill Mine in Australia.[17]
2007: Acquired the Palmarejo project from Bolnisi Gold NL and Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation. The Palmarejo Mine was put into production in 2008 and continues to operate in 2014.[15]
2013: Established Coeur Capital, Inc. to hold royalties and strategic investments.[18]
2016: Produced 14.8 million ounces of Ag and 358,170 ounces of Au.[19]

Operations[edit]
Kensington Mine is an underground gold mine located in the Alaskan panhandle about 75 km northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The Kensington property consists of 14,000 acres of mineral claims held by Coeur Alaska,[20] a subsidiary of Coeur Mining. Mining in the Kensington region first took place in the late 1800s and early 1900s and has occurred intermittently since that time.[10] Coeur acquired 50% of the Kensington property in 1987 and then 100% in 1995. After considerable exploration work involving option agreements with a number of different companies and a court case that contested permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers, the Kensington mine was finally put into Production on July 3rd, 2010.[10][2] The Kensington mine is an underground vein-style gold mine with several individual vein systems including the Kensington, Eureka, Raven, Elmira and Julian-Empire veins.[10] The mine uses the cut-and-fill or stope-and-fill underground mining method. In 2012, the mine produced 82,125 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.22 oz/ton and a total production cost of $1865/oz.[dubious – discuss] Reserves at the end of 2012 were just over 1 million ounces of gold.[2]
Rochester Mine is a heap-leach surface silver and gold mine located in the Humboldt Mountains near Lovelock, Nevada. The property consists of 9724 acres of mineral claims,[9] in the district of the historic mining town of Rochester, Nevada. Historic mining in the Rochester Mine area occurred from 1909 to 1935 and consisted of underground mining of high grade silver and gold veins. Coeur acquired the property in 1983 and restarted mining operations as a surface mine in 1986. Except for a three-year shut down from 2007 to 2010 due to low reserves and metal prices, the mine has operated continuously since re-opening.[9] The Rochester Mine produces ore from a conventional open pit operation, and from surface stockpiles of ore. The ore is processed using cyanide heap-leaching to produce silver-gold bars. In 2012 the mine produced 2.8 million ounces of silver and 38,066 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.55 oz/ton silver and 0.0047 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $14.05 per ounce of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 44.9 million ounces of silver and 308,000 ounces of gold.[2]
Palmarejo Mine is a surface and underground gold and silver mine located about 420 kilometers by road southwest of the city of Chihuahua in northwestern Mexico.[15] The property consists of over 12, 000 hectares of mineral claims encompassing several silver and gold veins systems. Small-scale underground mining for silver veins in the Palmarejo area has occurred intermittently since the early 1800s. [21] Coeur acquired the property in 2007 and mining commenced in 2008.[15] The Pamerejo mine produces ore from surface and underground operations that target a number of silver-gold vein systems. The ore is processed using flotation and cyanide leaching to produce silver-gold bars.[15] In 2012, the mine produced 8.2 million ounces of silver and 106,038 ounces of gold at a grade of 4.7 oz/ton silver and 0.05 oz/ton gold and at a total production cost of $19.26/oz of silver. Reserves at the end of 2012 were 5.3 million ounces of silver and 665,000 ounces of gold.[2]
San Bartolomé mine is a surface silver mine located near the historic mining city of Potosi, Bolivia; a world heritage site.[22] Mining of silver and silver-tin veins from Cerro Rico, a volcanic mountain adjacent to Potosi, began in the mid 1500s and has been continuous for over 450 years. In the 1650s, Potosi was the largest city in the western hemisphere with 160,000 residents.[23] Today, up to 15,000 people make a living mining small underground silver-tin veins. The property consists of approximately 4,800 hectares of surface mineral claims that encompass gravel deposits or silver-bearing rock along the flank of Cerro Rico.[23] Coeur acquired the San Bartolome property in 1999 and began current mining operations in 2008. The San Bartolomé Mine involves free digging of mineralized gravels along the flanks of Cerro Rico. This material is processed in a conventional cyanide leaching operation using the Merrill–Crowe process.[23] In 2012, the mine produced 5.9 million ounces of silver at a grade of 4.49 oz/ton and at a total operating cost of $15.81/oz. At the end of 2012 reserves are at 109 million ounces of silver.[2]
Projects[edit]
As of January, 2014 Coeur Mining holds two main exploration projects: Joaquin in Argentina and La Preciosa in Mexico. [24]
Joaquin is an advanced stage silver-gold exploration project located in Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. Gold and silver mineralization was discovered on the property by Mirosal Resources in 2004. Coeur began exploring the property in 2007 under an option agreement and acquired 100% of the property from Mirosal Resources in 2012.[25] The property contains oxide and sulphide silver-gold mineralization in epithermal veins, breccias and stockworks hosted in acid volcanic rocks of the Deseado Massif; a well-known mineralized belt in southern Argentina. In January, 2013 Joaquin has a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 15.7 million tonnes at 128.9 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au and an inferred mineral resource estimate of 1 million tonnes at 100.7 g/t Ag and 0.12 g/t Au.[25]
La Preciosa is an advanced stage silver-gold project located in Durango State Mexico. Coeur acquired the La Preciosa property through the acquisition of Orko Silver Corporation on April 16, 2013.[26] The property contains epithermal silver and gold veins and breccia bodies. As of July 26, 2013 La Preciosa had a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 51.9 million tonnes at 87.54 g/t Ag and 0.166 g/t Au and an indicated mineral resource estimate of 17.7 million tonnes at 66.31 g/t Ag and 0.106 g/t Au at a NSR cut off of $20.43/tonne.[27]

Coeur Capital, Inc. (Royalties and Investments)[edit]
Coeur Capital, Inc. was formed in 2013 to hold Coeur’s existing and future royalty and streaming interests along with its portfolio of strategic equity investments. In December 2013 Coeur Capital acquired Global Royalty Corp, a private company with royalty interests in mines in Mexico and Ecuador. As part of the acquisition, Mark Kucher, President and CEO of Global Royalty, joined Coeur Capital as the Managing Director.[28][29]
Coeur Capital holds a non-operating interest in the Endeavor Mine in New South Wales Australia. It acquired this interest in 2005 for $44.0 million and it entitles Coeur to all of the silver production and reserves (up to 20.0 million payable ounces) contained at the Endeavor Mine.[2] The company also owns net smelter royalties on the Cerro Bayo Mine in Chile, the El Gallo complex in Mexico, and the Zaruma Mine in Ecuador.[28][29] Coeur Capital also maintains shareholdings in a number of junior exploration companies for investment purposes. These include Hudra Silver, Pershing Gold, Commonwealth Silver, International Northair Mines, Silver Bull Resources, Soltoro, Caracara Silver, and Apogee Silver.[18]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

                Services                















Claim Filing
We also offer land status verification, which involves hand checking the plat maps and verifying all of the status against state lands, Indian lands and other withdrawals.
GRE, Inc. will guarantee accuracy in paperwork and submission with all respective counties and governing bodies in relation with mining claims.
Average time for client to receive all paperwork on claims including deeds and documentation is 45-60 business days. This time allows us to make sure that all issues have been resolved and your claim is unencumbered.











Geology Surveys And Samples
Maybe you just want an underground survey with samples. Our trained surveyors will document the exposed veins and lodes in the mine and extract samples from those ore bodies. These to be delivered directly to the claim owner or to one of our trusted Assayers. All samples are the property of the claim owner and are held strictly confidential.
Maybe you need some deep drilling and core sampling? We can do that as well. Drilling and core sample extractions are contracted out to GRE trusted companies.











Mine Exploration
Underground exploration can be dangerous. Our teams utilize both oxygen and gas meters to monitor air quality and are trained to safely navigate the inner workings of underground operations. Exploration occurs to the extent that is viably safe for the Surveyor to do so. In the case of re-opening closed mines, we require at least 30 days lead time for the mine to clear of “dead air”.
If it is determined that the mine cannot be safely documented, there will be a $100 survey fee. This fee will include pictures of the site from outside the mine and surrounding area. Underground exploration is billed at $1 per foot. Excavation services are on a case by case quote. Mine owner is responsible for any permits required from state to state.











Notice Of Intent / Operation
A solid notice of operation is the cornerstone of any mining operation. We offer our expertise and years of experience to help you write an effective Notice that gets approved. We have written over 100 Notices of Intent/Operation that have all been successfully approved by Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management agencies.

                Frequently Asked Questions                















General Questions



Why does Gold Rush Expeditions sell mining claims instead of working them themselves?
Our mission is to preserve mining history and to reestablish the glory days of mining. That has been our goal from the very beginning. Thousands of mine sites are destroyed across the West each year by the BLM, Forest Service and other land managers. Every mine we claim and sell can be moved off of that list of “Abandoned Mines” and thus preserved. We seek to document and preserve the work that made the West what it is today.
If Gold Rush stopped to “work” these mines, we would not be able to document and procure new sites. We would become strictly a mining company. That’s not who we are, and not what we do. We sell mines with visible veins of gold or gems every day. The mission of Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc is not to mine these sites. To coin a phrase, “We find ’em, You mine ’em!” 
 




Can I look at a claim site and test some samples before I buy?
Absolutely, but we do require a signed non-disclosure/confidentiality agreement prior to disclosing the location of sites. We do this because we spend a lot of time locating these sites and believe they have value, and often times the new claimant does not want a lot of people wandering around their claim after purchase.
In the case of claims listed on our website, we can hold a claim for seven days, with a nonrefundable deposit of $500.00. If you decide to purchase the claim, the $500.00 can then be used towards your purchase. We can also provide you with authorization to remove up to 100 lbs of sample.




How does Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. determine the price for each claim?
There are a variety of elements that determine the pricing of a particular mining claim or block of mining claims. For your information, here are some of the elements that are taken into consideration:
Mineral Content:
The surveyors themselves look through any available tailings to find evidence of precious metals. They inspect the ores and veins personally, and report the visible presences of any valuable minerals. It doesn’t get any more direct than that! The surveyors are looking for minerals that can be taken by hand in many cases. They bypass many mines with “microscopic gold” or “sulphide minerals” because they are difficult to extract value from. That is the reason you see Gold Rush mines stating “free milling gold” or visible gems and deposits. While our historical research is extensive and painstaking, we don’t solely rely on that second hand information. We validate and verify, right on site.
Scarcity/Rarity:
Contrary to popular belief, there are many mines out there with substantial mineral reserves and values. With that in mind, Mines are being destroyed by the BLM and Forest Service on a daily basis. 40 years ago, you could find a good producing mine in any variety of districts across the west. Not today. With reclamation becoming a business for the government, closures are more prevalent. Usable, mining claims are becoming more scarce. For instance, in a county or a district with high gold values but very few viable mines, those mines will have increased value. Our goal is to find a mine that is still intact, preferably not reclaimed, that can be worked profitably under casual use with no government interference. There are a lot of factors to take into consideration, we judge them all and pass the information to you.
Location:
Location in a key mining district or region is vital to pricing of a claim. If the mine is located in a gulch or drainage, it may rank higher. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc surveyors will often overlook mines that are right off the highway. No one wants to deal with lots of passerby’s unless the mine is completely stunning and secure. 
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc’s ideal sites are large, remote and undisturbed with substantial documentation. Even though a more remote mine will rank high, it’s not much good to you if you cannot build a road to it. Another element of the critique is if the claim is easily accessible by road or trail. A mine that is inaccessible, cannot ship out ores, and its thus going to rank low on our scale.
Environment:
The next element that is addressed are factors in the climate and environment in general. We look at the available resources on the site and make note if there’s any shelter, water, or timber.
Having year round water is often pivotal, and shelter is more than necessary when the sun is beating down on you. Some older mines will have remnants of old structures, and that can prove useful to a miner. Whether it’s providing shelter in a cabin, or utilizing an old mill. Sometimes it is easier and cheaper to utilize existing structures than building new.
Also as part of environment we consider the aesthetics. Is the mine itself awe inspiring? Does it have a special and unique look to it that you can’t quite find anywhere else? Does it have character? Does it have an interesting story? 
Market:
All of the elements above put together a good picture of the market for specific mines and properties. This market will fluctuate slightly from year to year, but similar to real estate, it always seems to grow. As mining companies and small miners pay more for claims, the values of others will grow. Naturally, history can attest to how valuable a mine is, records of the mine producing gold and/or other precious metals. The general trend is a positive one, where the exact mine claim that sold in 2008 for $50k, today will sell for over $110k in most regions. That’s not a bad trend!




Does Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc offer leases and/or shared ventures?
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. does not often enter into shared ventures. But there are rare occasions where we have been able to assist small miners in getting their operations up and running for a share of the smelter returns. 
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc does offer leases on many of its higher priced mining claim blocks. This is to assist the smaller miner with start up costs. We require an initial deposit and monthly lease payments. This is also predicated upon 10% return of net smelter returns.




Can I sell my mining claim through Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc.?
Yes! Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can help you sell your mining claims. We will even do all the work for you if required. There are specific criteria that must be met to meet the Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. standards. For more information, please give us a call at: 385-218-2138 or email us: goldrush@goldrushexpeditions.com






Purchasing



What sort of payment options does Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. accept?
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can accept credit/debit cards for monthly payments, deposits and down payments for a maximum amount of $500.00.
For payment of a purchase, we can only accept Personal Checks, Wire Transfers, Money Orders, Cashier’s Checks or other certified funds. Please be aware that mining claims are considered real property, and as such, the payments must be secured.
We do take cash if delivered in person to our main office. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. also accepts certified (stamped) silver and gold bullion for payment. Spot Pricing determines the value given for silver and gold. This fluctuates throughout the normal business day, and can be tracked on websites such as http://www.kitco.com/ Kitco website. Spot pricing is defined at the time of acceptance at the GRE offices.
We do not accept payments through PayPal. PayPal considers mining claims to be real property and their company policies don’t permit them to process transactions regarding real property.




Can I pay for my claim with ore collected from the claim?
No, we do not accept raw ores as a form of payment. Ores must be processed by a reputable source. They are then stamped with a weight and purity. Once the ores have been processed to this point they are referred to as bullion, and can be accepted at spot pricing.




What paperwork will I get after purchasing a mining claim from GRE?
You will receive a Quit Claim deed, showing transfer of ownership of the claim and all of the associated paperwork, images and documentation of the claim.
The Deed transfers the mineral rights from GRE to the new owner. The Deed is created and submitted to the appropriate State and Federal agencies.
You can expect to receive a New Claim Owner Welcome packet within 14 days of full payment. The welcome packet includes:

Land status map of the claim
Original copy of the Quit Claim Deed
National Bureau of Mines Claim Certificates
Digital copies of:

Land status map of the claim
Map showing GPS coordinates of the claim corner markers
All Pictures of the claim and underground images of the mine(s) where applicable
Notice of Location/Certificate of Location with BLM and county recorded stamp
Copy of the Signed Purchase Agreement
Guide to permitted mining operations (State Specific)


A copy of the Quit Claim Deed that has been recorded by the County and BLM will be emailed to you when returned from the County and BLM





Can I change the name of my claim after purchase?
Yes. A  mining claim Name can be modified by submitting an amended NOL/COL to the appropriate county and state BLM. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can also provide this service for a nominal cost.




Who can own a mining claim?
Mining Claims are limited in ownership by US Citizenship. Any US Citizen can own a mining company. Additionally, any US based company can take ownership of mining claims. In the case of international companies, those companies must be approved to do business in the Unites States.






Financing



What is the required down payment for financing a claim with GRE?
Mining Claim Financing is offered at a rate of 0% APR (annual percentage rate) for the first 6 months. If the claim is not paid off within 6 months a 9% APR (annual percentage rate) will be applied to the total claim price from the date of contract execution. If you would like to finance a claim, basic terms are a minimum of 25% down. A documentation fee of $349.00 per claim and $249 for each additional claim is added to this down payment. If buyer is over 30 days late, claim falls into default and reverts back to GRE with no return of any funds paid. We will not file collections, but we will not return funds.  Financing limited to one (1) buyer for one (1) site (in the case of multiple claims on a single site) at any given time. Buyer will have full access to the claim under casual use guidelines. More details on financing will be sent to those who are approved for financing.




Is a credit check required?

Please see your contract for full description and disclosure of all terms and agreements.






Auctions and eBay



Do you sell mining claims on eBay?
We do offer limited mining claims for purchase through eBay and other auction sites.
Our surveyors document a large number of claims each month. We only file and stake so many mining claims and reserve the best of the best for our website and customers. 
We do file claims on some mining claims that for various reasons do not meet the strict guidelines to be listed on our website. In such cases, these claims are liquidated to eBay or other auction sites.
These claims are still good and valid mining claims, and also carry the Gold Rush Guarantee.
 




If I am blocked from bidding can I become unblocked?
There are many reasons for eBay bidders to be blocked from participation in Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. auctions. The most common block is due to non-payment. If you have been banned from our auctions for non-payment or another reason, your bid will not be accepted. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. reserves the right to block bidders who have not paid on previous eBay claim purchases or any other reason at our sole discretion.
If you are a bidder with a feedback rating of less than 10, you will receive an email from Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. to confirm your identity. If your identity cannot be verified, you will likely be blocked. In most cases, you can resolve this with a quick call to our offices at 385-218-2138. Removing a bidder from the blocked list may take up to 24 hours. 






Mining Claims



What exactly am I getting with an Mineral Claim?
An unpatented lode claim gives the claimant complete ownership of all minerals and gems located within the confines of the mining claim. 
Lode Mineral Claims give ownership of minerals that are located in their original location or amalgamated in a host rock.
Placer Mineral Claims give ownership of valuable minerals or gems that have been displaced from their original lodes and can be found in gravels or riverbeds. Placer claims usually apply to the topmost 18 inches of gravel or sands.
All unpatented mineral claim rights are subject to annual renewal. Plainly put, If you do not renew your claim annually, those rights will revert back to the US Federal Government. Keep your mining claim active and valid by paying your annual assessments before September 1st of each year.
Ownership of a mining claim, either placer or lode does not, by default, convey or imply ownership or interest in any BUILDINGS, MACHINERY or other EQUIPMENT that is found within the boundaries of the claim. In the case of many mining claims, it is possible to take control of the buildings, machinery or other items by filing a Notice of Operation and utilizing the  items in conjunction with or to promote your mineral extraction operation. 
Use of any implement, building or machine on the mineral claim may not violate the Antiquities Act of 1906. Any items that have been undisturbed (undisturbed means that the item has not been moved or utilized in any manner) for over 50 years are subject to the Antiquities Act and any movement or removal of said items is a violation of federal law.
When in doubt, please inquire. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. has years of experience and we can provide answers to any questions that may arise.




How do I keep my claim active?
All mining claims must be renewed each year with the appropriate county and Bureau of Land Management. This is done in one of two ways:

Pay an annual assessment fee and record and register your claim with the County and Bureau of Land Management before September 1st of each year.  
Document improvements made to your claim and submit a waiver to the county and Bureau of Land Management.

Annual assessment fees are the fees paid to the Department of the Interior to maintain ownership of your property. Annual Assessment fees are subject to change. In 2015 and 2016, the cost to renew a single, 20 acre lode or placer claim was $155.00. Please call us for current pricing.
Assessment fees or Annual Maintenance for unpatented claims are due by September 1st of every year, no exceptions. Claims that are not renewed by September 1st will revert back to federal ownership.
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can assist with the Annual Assessment process to ensure that you retain ownership of your claim each year.




Can an unpatented claim be changed to a patented claim?
No, not at this time. There is currently a moratorium on patenting mining claims. This was signed in by President Bill Clinton in 1994 specifically to hinder mining efforts in the United States. Until this moratorium is lifted,  it is not currently possible to patent (gain full ownership of the land) an unpatented mining claim.




How many claims can an individual own?
There is no limit to the number of claims you can own. In order to file a small miner waiver for annual assessments, you cannot own over 10 claims.




How long does a mining claim remain active?
Indefinitely, provided that the annual assessment payments are kept current. These annual assessments must be completed by September 1st of each year.




Weren't most mines abandoned because they were all mined out?
It may come as a surprise, but most mines were not abandoned due to lack of production or minerals. There are many reasons that mines were abandoned. The most common are related to regulation and are as follows:

The “Silver Crash” of 1891-3. Federal support for purchase of silver and silver ores was removed in 1891. The value of silver dropped from over $1 per ounce to $0.27 per ounce in 1893, stabilizing at an average of $0.79 by the end of the year. This equated to a cut of more than 30%. (Consider the impact that losing 30% of your income tomorrow would have on your own economy.) As a result, many silver mines were mothballed while waiting for the price to rise to previous levels of $1 per ounce.
During WWI and WWII many left their mines to either fight in the war or help support the war effort by working in other industries.
In 1941, President Roosevelt made it illegal to pursue the mining of any minerals except those considered strategic. This act was known as the War Act, and its intent was to cripple the mining industry, while providing man power for WWII. 418,000 men never returned from WWII. This left their mining operations abandoned. In addition, over 300,000 were wounded, left permanently disabled and were unable to return to their mines.  Many men after WWII never returned to their mines.
In the years after WWII, the federal government bolstered efforts to encourage people to work in the cities and offices of the nation. 
Since the repeal of the War Act in 1945, Mining activity decreased over 400%. These mines were left abandoned because people died or were no longer able to work their mines. Many more people held their mining claims while they worked their city jobs from 9-5, all the while promising to return to mining at some point. Most never did, and when they died, or stopped paying on their claims, they were considered abandoned.





Where can I get raw ore processed?
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. recommends the Paradine Mill in Montana for processing your ore. There are also a good number of mills that can process ores in Nevada and Arizona.
A good mine should be able to offset the costs of logistics by producing rich ores. 
For more information, please call our office at 385-218-2138 during normal business hours.






Working your Claim



Can I build a cabin or other structure on my claim?
Yes, but only with an approved Notice of Operation. Your building will need to be in direct support of your mining operation. You will likely be assessed a bond that insures that you will remove the cabin when you leave the claim.
You can make improvements to current structures on the claim with an approved notice of intent or notice of operations. The improvements must be in support of mining operations.




How far can I tunnel outside my claim boundaries?
As far as you want, as long as you don’t breach the surface. You have virtually unlimited rights underground provided your workings do not surface at any time outside of your claim boundaries. In the case of your workings surfacing outside your claim boundaries, another party could claim that portion of the workings. The legal owner of those workings would be the claimant which controls the apex of the lode on their claim.




I got a letter/notice from the BLM or FS, what do I do? 
You usually have 30 days from receipt of the letter to respond. If you do not respond in that time frame you may lose your rights.
What you need to do depends on what the letter says. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can assist you in responding to these notices. If you require assistance with a BLM or FS issue, please call our offices at 385-218-2138 to see how we can help.




 Can I live on my claim?
The word “live” implies doing things possibly not incident to or reasonably related to mining. You can’t “live” on your claim, but you can prospect and mine it. Residency not reasonably incident to mining is not allowed. If it is reasonable to pack up mining gear and go back to a town or campground, you will be expected to do that, rather than stay more than 14 days straight on your claim. However if it is approved in your Notice of Operations, then yes you can remain on your claim for however many days you listed in your approved Notice of Operations.




 Are there public utilities (power, water, etc.) that I can use on the claim?
On rare occasion, there are public utilities near or on the property. If public utilities are present you can contact the utility company for set up requirements.




Can Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. provide help to those new to mining?
There is a lot of information that we can help the beginning miner with. This from permitting to logistics and processing. If you need help, give us a call (385-218-2138 ) or email goldrush@goldrushexpeditions.com, let us know what you need and we can help you put it together. 
There are also volumes of information available on mining basics in the form of old mining books. For a list a recommended books please contact our offices. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can answer specific questions regarding mining basics and operations. Email your specific questions to goldrush@goldrushexpeditions.com




Where can I buy equipment to mine with? 
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. is very particular about who we work with. For this reason we only make recommendations we can stand behind.
Global Mining Equipment is an all American provider of all your mining equipment or needs. If you need it, Global has it. Global Mining Equipment comes highly recommended by Gold Rush Expeditions Inc.




I bought a claim from someone else, can Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. verify the validity of that claim?
Yes, we can research and report on the validity of your claim. This is charged per hour based on the current Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. office services rate. Call 385-218-2138 or email goldrush@goldrushexpeditions.com for more information.






Gold



Why do people attach so much value to Gold?
Gold is one of the rarest elements on the planet earth. It has been used as currency and for trade since the dawn of recorded history. It is a solid, tangible asset that can be used to purchase, barter or trade for most any item.




How does gold differ from pyrite?
Pyrite is a derivative of iron. Pyrite often occurs in gold lodes. Old Spanish prospectors lived by the motto: “Gold rides an iron horse”. Meaning that where you find heavy concentrations of iron, you will find gold.
If you find something that you think is gold. Use the knife method to verify. Gold is mallable, it will feel soft. You can gouge it with a knife but it will not scratch. Pyrite on the other hand is a more crystalline formation and is very hard. If you scratch it with a knife, the surface will mar and become defaced.
Gold and pyrite differ slightly in color, shape, hardness, odor, and malleability. It’s not difficult to tell the two apart once you have seen them side by side. Gold also forms in and with pyrite, in a form known as auferous pyrite. For more information please see:Difference Between Gold and Pyrite




What does gold look like in its native form/in the host rock?
The appearance of gold is dependent on how it is formed. Native gold, in a good mine, will look exactly like what it is. Gold. Gold is soft. It can be “dented” with the tip of a knife or other hard object. Gold is also globulus, meaning it is not crystalline, it will not have hard edges, or any crystal formations.
Native Gold is also called “Free Gold”, or “Free Milling Gold”, this  refers to gold that can be crushed and panned out. By crushing the rock, you will break the gold out of it. It can then be panned out with water or other chemicals. 
Gold can also be microscopic and invisible to the naked eye. Unless you are planning a pit mine processing thousands of tons per day, microscopic gold is as good as no gold.
Gold often runs with quartz. Gold also alloys with metals such as copper, iron and silver.
An old miner adage is that that you always want to be on the look out for one of the 4 metals, which always occur together, those being: Gold, Silver, Copper and Platinum. The concentrations may vary, but this is a very accurate statement. This is why there are a lot of mines named “The 4 Metals”.




Where can I find the current price on Gold/Silver?
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. recommends Kitco.com. Kitco website.

                About Us                















The Story of Gold Rush Expeditions – From then ’til now.
It all started with George Thompson and a book called “Some Dreams Die” in 1988. The book is basically a treasure hunter’s handbook, George set up grand images of mining days gone by and the lost treasures buried by miners, Indians, and other outlaws.
In 1989, Driver’s license in one hand and a well read, dog-eared copy of “Some Dreams Die”, Corey set out to find these lost treasures. Endless days and long starry nights were spent wandering and exploring the hills of Utah’s remote and unforgiving west Desert. Days were spent matching lore with real maps and history and then finding and documenting the old areas. One aspect became clear and consistent with each discovery, everything was tied to mining sites. That lead to a different search. What was this mining thing, and why was it nearly dead for the average person today?
History is pretty clear that the west was settled on one concept. Mining. Anyone could be a prospector. These prospectors combed the hills and sometimes made a strike. Farmers and Ranchers followed, feeding the miners. This was the start of a community. Soon a small town would form, because Americans are capitalists if anything, and these miners and ranchers, needed supplies. As the mines expanded, so did the towns. Soon there were rail lines. Be aware that the cross country rail lines were not built for the people and tourism of the Nation. No, they were built to transport massive loads of gold and silver ores to mills and plants.
These towns would flourish from mining. Schools, hospitals and more would pop up in support of the mining operations. In many cases, when the mines died out for whatever reasons, the towns would fade as well. It’s a story that can be seen all over the west even today.
Corey found it intriguing that most every town in Utah could be traced back to mining. Even Brigham Young and his band of Mormons were only able to survive by selling wares to the people who passed along on their way to the gold fields of Nevada, or the Gold Rush lands of California. Yet very little mining was happening today. 
Over the years, Corey couldn’t help but notice more and more historic mining sites vanishing from the landscape. Tunnels and drifts that made up the being of many men’s lives were backfilled and bulldozed. The history completely destroyed and the mines and their locations becoming lost knowledge.
A bit of investigation showed that this history was being viciously destroyed by our own US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management through their Abandoned Mine Reclamation Programs. No concern for history or the heritage of a mine camp that had been tucked away for 100 years in a long forgotten canyon. No concern for the men still mining their claims on the weekend for some extra money.
The mission of these agencies is nothing less than the eradication of mining from the face of the land. Entire historic mine camps from the 1800s through the great depression are/were being burned and bulldozed at an alarming rate. This destruction included mills, ore bins, trusses, and cabins. These historic mines where people had built a life, were being completely erased from the landscape, never to be seen again.
Utah Division of Oil Gas and Mining Director John Baza said it best, “It’s time to erase the scar of mining from this land”.
One week these abandoned mining camps would be there, the next week there would be an empty bulldozed piece of land. No history, no remembrance of the men and women who worked, slept and may have died there. The concept of wiping out the history of these people and what they built through mining was completely unacceptable. Corey was determined to do something about it, and so Gold Rush Expeditions was born.
Today Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. combs the historic maps and documents locating valuable and historic mining sites that are still standing. As a company, we have come to learn that mining is not dead. Many mines hold millions and sometimes billions of dollars in gold and gem reserves. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. locates these sites and documents them thoroughly. Then offering them up for sale, providing opportunities for mining to grow and live again. Mining has been around since the beginning of time, and it’s not too difficult to make a living like thousands of miners have done over the years.
“We find ’em you mine ’em”, that pretty much sums it up. Over the years Gold Rush Expeditions have become experts at finding the best available mines in the West and then documenting and presenting those mines to the public. GRE takes care of all of the paperwork with the BLM and simplifies the process. Then we show you what you need to do to mine it. Our legal team helps you through all of the steps of permitting and turning your mining operation into a working, producing mine. 
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. also sponsors the National Bureau of Mines. A repository of every mine and mine site that they have documented over the years. The goal is to educate people about America’s mining heritage, remind us all that we come from tough stock. People who were both dreamers and doers. Highlighting the incredible feats they accomplished. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc wants to bring back the Gold Rush. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. wants these mining sites to be around for future generations to learn from and enjoy.
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. formally formed as an incorporated entity in 2004. Since that time they have grown exponentially, evolving into a powerful force restoring mining as a way of life.
Mining Today
Today the opportunity for mining is greater than it has ever been. Old mines that were abandoned when gold mining was made illegal by the War Act are still out there. These mines provided more than a living, they provided independence and freedom.  Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. locates mines throughout the West. These mines are ready to work with rich veins visible and ores exposed. While regulations have increased, the tools and ability to process the ore from these historic mines are more effective than ever.
While each year more and more mines are erased from our landscape, Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. is racing against the destruction. We are out documenting the old mines in the backcountry of the West. Researching, Surveying and filing Claims on the valuable sites.
These Mines were America’s past success and with a little work, they are America’s future success. Gold Rush envisions the transition, a generation of paper pushing, computer terminal warriors being transformed into an army of miners. Creating their own future and prosperity working underground, digging out gold and gems. 
Over the years Gold Rush has seen that we are not alone. There are many miners in waiting, snapping up these sites as quickly as we can locate them.
Gold Rush is playing a small part in helping Americans to remember and appreciate their past. This while offering an opportunity to work the mines and provide a good living for themselves.
“It’s a 21st century Gold Rush. If our kids and their kids have something to look back on, then we are accomplishing what we have set out to do.”
 
A Crash Course on Abandoned Mine Reclamation
Back in the 1970’s the nation’s mining heritage dotted, if not covered, the landscape of the Western States. An estimated 115 to 120 thousand of these old abandoned mines were found scattered throughout the West. Their head frames and waste piles provided a glimpse into the Nation’s past. Today there are still some surviving mines on federal lands, but most of those will be gone in a few decades. The loss of Western mining heritage will accelerate in the coming years, rather than diminish. Not because of the gradual effects of wind, weather, and vandals, but primarily due to government reclamation programs. In 1977, Congress passed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act which taxes active coal mines. The funds were meant to fix safety hazards and environmental problems from two centuries of coal mining, but increasingly the funds are applied towards eliminating historic hard rock mines in the West. Since the passage of the Act in 1977, $7.2 billion has been spent by the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) to reclaim old mines that have been deemed “hazardous”. The history of these landmarks is gone forever. Never to be seen again.
Why the BLM and FS are Bent on Closing Abandoned Mines
The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service claim that they are bulldozing old mining sites for public safety, which is a believable story until you look at the numbers. From 2013 to 2014, there were only 4 deaths across the United States attributed to abandoned mines. In 2012 there were 15 deaths attributed to abandoned mines. In 2011, there were 5 deaths attributed to abandoned mines. In relation, there are approximately 10 people PER DAY that die while swimming in lakes and rivers across the US. That is over 3,500 people per year. So why isn’t there more of a focus on lake and river safety?
Follow the money. They have the money to spend and it’s use it or risk losing it. There also seems to be an underlying current among the BLM and Forest Service to reclaim much of the land in the West to its primitive state. It appears that the BLM and Forest service use the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act to reclaim mines and the Endangered Species Act to close large swaths of land with the same goal, to keep the public from using the land.
Why it is Important to Preserve our Mining Heritage
The destruction of these historic landmarks is alarming. We are actively destroying our heritage. We are standing on the shoulders of giants and at the same time, our government organizations are determined to erase all evidence that these giants ever existed. When we remember the struggles that our predecessors went through and the obstacles they overcame we begin to see that we are part of a larger narrative. It gives us added strength. We become more resilient and better able to deal with the challenges in our own lives. The ingenuity, resourcefulness and the stick to it mentality of these old miners are absolutely amazing. Here they were far from civilization, making their living cutting tunnels and bringing out gold. They built small towns with whatever resources they could find. They crossed the plains and built every mining town from Leadville, Colorado, and Virginia City, Nevada, to Butte Montana. They were independent and hardworking dreamers, who in very essence built the West. Thomas Paine wrote, over 200 years ago, “What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly”. In a bigger sense when we forget the price that was paid for the rise of this nation and the struggles that we overcame to get where we are; we esteem our current position too lightly and we risk losing what our ancestors worked so hard to gain. One of the main reasons we work so hard to preserve these old mines is so that we have the physical reminders of the contributions of those who went before us.
 
In Corey’s own words, “It’s a wild ride. I never expected to see so many mining enthusiasts. We’ve had our fair share of tough times, but I have no regrets. This is what I love doing, and the more mines I can save and put into production, the bigger the chance that these mines and their history will be preserved. The best part is seeing the number of people who are able to make a good living, working mines that would have otherwise been destroyed.”

I really like this claim, it is one of the nicest you have offered. I loved it the last time it was available. I’d just like to add; Corey, you and your crew are awesome. You have provided a great deal of information on mining and prospecting and have been professional and upstanding to the utmost. You are helping to make the dream come true for many. Have a great day.

You can’t go wrong buying a mine from GRE, They are honest and accurate with their details. I can’t say enough so nuf’ said

by Don Wotherspoon
 






Last spring I bought a lode mining claim in southern Arizona from Gold Rush Expeditions (GRE). I purchased this claim from GRE because I felt that they were a reputable, professional company. In September I received a notice from BLM that they wanted an amendment to the Notice of Location that had previously been accepted by the county and BLM, or else they would terminate my claim. I contacted GRE and they quickly responded to this regulatory change by BLM and submitted amendments to the county and BLM, which have been recorded successfully. It is one thing to have a company complete a sale and accept your funds. It is another to have that company come through for you after the sale when it matters.

I highly recommend GRE as a competent company with integrity. I would go back to them again in the future.

We have done business with Gold Rush almost since the inception.  We have purchased and/or sold numerous claims with Gold Rush and have always had a very pleasant purchasing and selling experience... Phone calls, emails, and messages have always been handled in prompt, courteous manner... 
We would recommend Gold Rush Expeditions to our valued customers and friends as having a highly respectful and honest organization... "You need not worry as their word tends to be their BOND"...

When GRE says that they want satisfied customers, it's not just words. They prove it with actions that go beyond normal business practices. So this is a shout out to them .....Kudos for all.

I have bought other claims from individuals that were later forfeited to the BLM because of a failure by the previous owners to file the proper paperwork. I was able to reclaim the claims, but what a pain and waste of time and money. I know when I purchase a claim from Gold Rush Expeditions the claim is solid and your support team is there if assistance is needed. I would especially recommend purchasing claims from Gold Rush Expeditions to someone who is new to prospecting. I am waiting for the weather to cooperate a little more before going to the claim, but I feel like I have already been there by way of your video. I hope to purchase more claims from Gold Rush Expeditions in the future.

GRE has answered my questions and some I didn't have. Very nice to work with. Easy communication and fast service. I would highly recommend them for a mine purchase.
