A&Q Aggregated Alpha Strategies Fund LLC 
Notes to Financial Statements 
(Unaudited)   
June 30, 2015   
   


1.
 Organization 
A&Q Aggregated Alpha Strategies Fund LLC (the Fund) was organized as a limited liability company under the
laws of Delaware on July 29, 2004 and commenced operations on October 1, 2004. The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment
company. The Fund is commonly referred to as a fund of funds. Its investment objective is to seek capital appreciation over the long term. The Fund is a multi-strategy fund that pursues its investment objective by seeking absolute
returns with lower volatility and correlation to the broader markets principally through the allocation of assets among a select group of alternative asset managers (the Investment Managers) and the funds they operate. Investment
Managers generally conduct their investment programs through unregistered investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, that have investors other than the Fund, and in other registered investment companies (collectively, the Investment
Funds).  Subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, the business and affairs of the Fund shall be managed under
the direction of the Funds Board of Directors (the Board, with an individual member referred to as a Director). The Board shall have the right, power and authority, on behalf of the Fund and in its name, to do all
things necessary and proper to carry out its duties under the Funds Limited Liability Company Agreement, as amended and restated from time to time. Each Director shall be vested with the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of
the Fund as are customarily vested in each director of a Delaware corporation, and each Director who is not an interested person (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund shall be vested with the same powers, authority and
responsibilities on behalf of the Fund as are customarily vested in each director of a closed-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act that is organized as a Delaware corporation who is not an interested person of
such company. No Director shall have the authority individually to act on behalf of or to bind the Fund except within the scope of such Directors authority as delegated by the Board. The Board may delegate the management of the Funds
day-to-day operations to one or more officers or other persons (including, without limitation, UBS Hedge Fund Solutions (as defined below)), subject to the investment objective and policies of the Fund and to the oversight of the Board. 
The Directors have engaged UBS Hedge Fund Solutions LLC (formerly UBS Alternative and Quantitative Investments LLC) (UBS
Hedge Fund Solutions, the Adviser and, when providing services under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator), a Delaware limited liability company, to provide investment advice regarding the selection of
Investment Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. The Adviser is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. 
Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may be accepted at such times as the Directors may
determine and are generally accepted monthly. The Directors reserve the right to reject any application for interests in the Fund.

written tenders to members (the Members). These repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their complete and exclusive discretion. The Adviser expects that generally, it will
recommend to the Directors that the Fund offer to repurchase interests from Members twice each year, near mid-year and year-end. Members can only transfer or assign their membership interests, or a portion thereof, (i) by operation of law
pursuant to the death, bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution of a Member, or (ii) with the written approval of the Directors, which may be withheld in their sole and absolute discretion. Such transfers may be made even if the balance of the
capital account to such transferee is equal to or less than the transferors initial capital contribution.

 New Accounting Pronouncement 
In May 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Codification Accounting Standards Update
No. 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (ASU 2015-07). ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all
investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value (NAV) per share practical expedient. ASU 2015-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-07 is currently being assessed by the Adviser of the Fund.

 Significant Accounting Policies   


 
a.
 Portfolio Valuation 
The Fund values its investments at fair value, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP), which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
The Fund uses NAV as its measure of fair value of an investment in an investee when (i) the Funds investment does
not have a readily determinable fair value and (ii) the NAV of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the underlying investments at
fair value. In evaluating the level at which the fair value measurement of the Funds investments have been classified, the Fund has assessed factors including, but not limited to, price transparency, the ability to redeem at NAV at the
measurement date and the existence or absence of certain restrictions at the measurement date.

a.
 Portfolio Valuation (continued)   
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
 






Level 1
 
quoted prices in active markets for identical investments

Level 2
 
fair value of investments in Investment Funds with the ability to redeem in full within one quarter from the measurement date

Level 3
 
fair value of investments in Investment Funds that do not have the ability to redeem within one quarter from the measurement date
 The Fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above and transfers between
an Investment Funds liquid holdings and side pocket holdings at the end of the reporting period. All transfers into and out of Level 3 can be found in the Level 3 reconciliation table within the Schedule of Portfolio Investments. The Fund
considers all Investment Funds with the ability to redeem in full within one quarter of the measurement date at the Investment Funds NAV to be Level 2. 
GAAP provides guidance in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an
asset or liability when compared with normal market activity for such asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities). GAAP also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction with regards to such an asset or
liability is not orderly. In its consideration, the Fund must consider inputs and valuation techniques used for each class of assets and liabilities. Judgment is used to determine the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities for which
disclosures about fair value measurements are provided. Fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities requires greater disaggregation than the Funds line items in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and
Members Capital. The Fund determines the appropriate classes for those disclosures on the basis of the nature and risks of the assets and liabilities and their classification in the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Levels 1, 2, and 3). 
For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, the Fund provides quantitative
disclosures about the fair value measurements separately for each class of assets and liabilities, as well as a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of Level 3 assets and liabilities broken down by class. 
The following is a summary of the investment strategies and any restrictions on the liquidity provisions of the investments in
Investment Funds held in the Fund as of June 30, 2015. Investment Funds with no current redemption restrictions may be subject to future gates, lock-up provisions or other restrictions, in accordance with their offering documents. The Fund had

commitments as of June 30, 2015. The Fund used the following categories to classify its Investment Funds: 
The Investment Fund in the credit/income strategy utilizes credit analysis to evaluate potential investments and uses debt or
debt-linked instruments to execute its investment theses. Its approach can be either fundamental, quantitative, or a combination of both. The Investment Fund in the credit/income strategy has restrictions on liquidity in its offering documents as
described in the table below:

  *       The Investment Fund is available to be redeemed in

 The Investment Funds in the equity hedged strategy generally utilize fundamental analysis to
invest in publicly traded equities investing in both long and short positions seeking to capture perceived security mispricing. Portfolio construction is driven primarily by bottom-up fundamental research; top-down analysis may also be applied. The
Investment Funds in the equity hedged strategy have restrictions on liquidity in their offering documents as described in the table below:

full holdings at any redemption date typically requiring 4 redemption periods.
 The Investment Funds in the multi-strategy strategy invest in both long and short, equity and
debt strategies that are primarily in US based securities. The management of these Investment Funds seek arbitrage opportunities, distressed securities, corporate restructures and hedges established in equities, convertible securities, options,
warrants, rights, forward contracts, futures, trade claims, credit default swaps and other derivatives, real estate and other financial instruments. The

 The other category contains investment approaches that are outside of the mainstream hedge
fund strategies (credit/income, equity hedged, relative value and trading). The category includes other strategies, such as certain private equity and real estate dealings, as well as niche investment approaches including asset-backed lending,
insurance-linked securities, direct private lending, factoring, infrastructure investing, viatical/structured settlements, natural resources and weather derivatives. The Investment Funds in the other strategy have restrictions on liquidity in their

 The Investment Funds in the relative value strategy, a broad category, generally encompass
strategies that are non-fundamental and non-directional, and often quantitatively driven. The Investment Funds in this strategy typically use arbitrage to exploit mispricing and other opportunities in various asset classes, geographies, and time
horizons. The Investment Funds frequently focus on capturing the spread between two assets, while maintaining neutrality to other factors, such as geography, changes in interest rates, equity market movement, and currencies, to

  **     These Investment Funds limit investors ability to redeem their

 The Investment Fund in the trading strategy is generally top-down in nature and often driven
by econometric and macroeconomic research. The Investment Fund may utilize financial instruments, such as foreign exchange, equities, rates, sovereign debt, currencies, and commodities to express a managers view. In executing different
approaches, the manager may use either fundamental or quantitative models or a combination of both. The Investment Fund in the trading strategy has restrictions on liquidity in its offering documents as described in the table below:

 A detailed depiction of each investment in the portfolio by investment strategy, including any
additional liquidity terms and other restrictions, as well as a breakdown of the portfolio into the fair value measurement levels, can be found in the tables within the Schedule of Portfolio Investments. 
The NAV of the Fund is determined by the Funds administrator, under the oversight of the Adviser, as of the close of
business at the end of any fiscal period in accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the Directors. The Funds investments in Investment Funds are
subject to the terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and offering memorandums, as appropriate. The Adviser has adopted procedures pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements in which the
Fund values its investments in Investment Funds at fair value. Fair value is generally

 Portfolio Valuation (continued)   

determined utilizing NAVs supplied by, or on behalf of, the Investment Funds investment managers, which are net of management and incentive fees charged by the Investment Funds. NAVs
received by, or on behalf of, the Investment Funds investment managers are based on the fair value of the Investment Funds underlying investments in accordance with the policies established by the Investment Funds. Because of the
inherent uncertainty of valuation, the value of the Funds investments in the Investment Funds may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a ready market been available. See Schedule of Portfolio Investments for
further information.  The fair value relating to certain underlying investments of these Investment Funds, for which there
is no ready market, has been estimated by the respective Investment Funds management and is based upon available information in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values and does not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately
be realized. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. These differences could be material. 
It is unknown, on an aggregate basis, whether the Investment Funds held any investments whereby the Funds proportionate
share exceeded 5% of the Funds members capital at June 30, 2015.  The fair value of the Funds
assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members Capital.   


 
b.
 Investment Transactions and Income Recognition 
The Fund accounts for realized gains and losses from Investment Fund transactions based on the
pro-rata ratio of the fair value and cost of the underlying investment at the date of redemption. Interest income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis. 
 


 
c.
 Fund Expenses 
The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs and expenses
related to portfolio transactions and positions for the Funds account; legal fees; accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Funds NAV; costs of insurance; registration expenses; interest expense; offering and
organization costs; due diligence, including travel and related expenses; expenses of meetings of Directors; all costs with respect to communications to Members; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors.

d.
 Income Taxes 
The Fund has reclassified $765,475 and $1,368,475 from accumulated net investment loss and accumulated net realized gain from
investments in Investment Funds, respectively, to net capital contributions during the six month period ended June 30, 2015. The reclassification was to reflect, as an adjustment to net contributions, the amount of estimated taxable income or
loss that have been allocated to the Funds Members as of June 30, 2015 and had no effect on members capital. 
The Fund files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and applicable states. Management has analyzed the
Funds tax positions taken on its federal and state income tax returns for all open tax years, and has concluded that no provision for federal or state income tax is required in the Funds financial statements. The Funds federal and
state income tax returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have not expired are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of revenue. The Fund will recognize interest and penalties, if
any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. For the six month period ended June 30, 2015, the Fund did not incur any interest or penalties. The Adviser does not believe there are positions for
which it is reasonably likely that the total amounts of unrecognized tax liability will significantly change within twelve months of the reporting date. 
Each Member is individually required to report on its own tax return its distributive share of the Funds taxable income
or loss.   


 
e.
 Cash 
Cash consists of monies held at The Bank of New York Mellon (the Custodian). Such cash, at times, may exceed
federally insured limits. The Fund has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such accounts.   


 
f.
 Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in members capital from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Because of the uncertainty of valuation, such estimates may differ significantly from values that would have been used had a ready market existed, and the differences could be
material.

 Related Party Transactions 
The Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement. In consideration
for such services, the Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee (the Management Fee) at an annual rate of 1.30% of the Funds members capital, excluding the capital account attributable to the Adviser. 
The Administrator provides certain other administrative services to the Fund including, among other things, providing office
space and other support services. In consideration for such services, the Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee (the Administrator Fee) at an annual rate of 0.30% of the Funds members capital, excluding the capital
account attributable to the Adviser. The Management Fee and the Administrator Fee will be paid to the Adviser out of the Funds assets and debited against the Members capital accounts, excluding the capital account attributable to the
Adviser. A portion of the Management Fee is paid by UBS Hedge Fund Solutions to its affiliates.  UBS Financial Services
Inc. (UBS FSI), a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS Americas, Inc., acts as a placement agent for the Fund, without special compensation from the Fund, and bears its own costs associated with its activities as placement agent. Placement
fees, if any, charged on contributions are debited against the contribution amounts, to arrive at a net subscription amount. The placement fee does not constitute assets of the Fund. 
The net increase or decrease in members capital derived from operations (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital
accounts of all Members on a pro-rata basis, other than the Administrator Fee and the Management Fee which are similarly allocated to all Members other than the Adviser as described above. 
Each Director of the Fund receives an annual retainer of $8,250 plus a fee for each meeting attended. The Chairman of the
Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors each receive an additional annual retainer in the amount of $20,000. These additional annual retainer amounts are paid for by the Fund on a pro-rata basis along
with the seven other registered alternative investment funds advised by UBS Hedge Fund Solutions. All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund for all reasonable out of pocket expenses. 
Other investment partnerships sponsored by UBS AG or its affiliates may also maintain investment interests in the Investment
Funds owned by the Fund.

 Administration and Custody Fees 
BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (BNY Mellon), as Fund administrator, performs certain additional
administrative, accounting, record keeping, tax and investor services for the Fund. BNY Mellon receives a monthly fee primarily based upon (i) the average members capital of the Fund subject to a minimum monthly fee, and (ii) the
aggregate members capital of the Fund and certain other investment funds sponsored or advised by UBS AG, UBS Americas, Inc. or their affiliates. Additionally, the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by BNY Mellon. 
The Custodian has entered into a service agreement whereby it provides custodial services for the Fund. 
 


6.
 Loan Payable 
The Fund, along with several other funds advised by UBS Hedge Fund Solutions, is party to a secured Credit Agreement dated as
of November 1, 2010, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, which will terminate on July 16, 2015 unless extended (the Credit Agreement). Under the Credit Agreement, the Fund may borrow from time to
time on a revolving basis at any time up to $9,000,000 for temporary investment purposes and to meet requests for tenders. Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement accrues interest at a rate per annum for each day equal to 1.5% plus the
higher of the Overnight LIBOR Rate and the Federal Funds Rate for such day (the Interest Rate), or at 2% over the Interest Rate during an event of default. There is a commitment fee payable by the Fund, calculated at 35 basis points per
annum of the line of credit not utilized.  For the six month period ended June 30, 2015, the Funds average
interest rate paid on borrowings was 1.62% per annum and the average borrowings outstanding was $8,333. The Fund did not have any borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2015. Interest expense for the six month period ended June 30, 2015
was $135, of which none was payable at June 30, 2015.   


7.
 Investments 
As of June 30, 2015, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none of which were related parties. 
Aggregate purchases and proceeds from sales of investments for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 amounted to
$10,250,000 and $16,745,949, respectively.

 Investments (continued)   
The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items
of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment Funds. The allocated taxable income is reported to the Fund by the Investment Funds on Schedule K-1. The tax basis of investments for 2015 will not be finalized by the Fund until after the
fiscal year end.  The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for compensation to the general
partners/managers in the form of management fees of 1.00% to 2.00% (per annum) of net assets and incentive fees or allocations ranging from 17.50% to 20.00% of net profits earned. One or more Investment Funds have entered into a side pocket
arrangement. Detailed information about the Investment Funds portfolios is not available. Please see the Schedule of Portfolio Investments for further information.   


8.
 Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests trade various financial instruments and enter
into various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts, contracts for differences and equity swaps. The Funds risk of loss in these Investment
Funds is limited to the fair value of these investments.   


9.
 Indemnification 
In the ordinary course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts or agreements that contain indemnifications or
warranties. Future events could occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Fund. Based on its history and experience, the Fund believes that the likelihood of such an event is remote. 
 


10.
 Subsequent Events 
As of June 30, 2015, the Fund had $6,639,158 of withdrawals payable. On July 24, 2015, the Fund paid $5,975,243. The
remaining amount payable of $663,915 is scheduled to be paid in accordance with the terms of the Funds June 30, 2015 tender offer. 
On August 13, 2015, the Board approved the formal liquidation of the Fund, and as such, the Fund is proceeding with a
liquidation of its portfolio of investments. As a result, withdrawals out of the Fund have been suspended, and proceeds will be distributed in an orderly manner. Subscriptions into the Fund, for both new and existing Members, have been suspended
since May 1, 2015, and will remain suspended throughout the liquidation, distribution and wind down. Notices regarding the Funds liquidation have been sent to Members, and Members will continue to receive pertinent information from the
Adviser, as appropriate.

(a)
 Available frequency of redemptions after the initial lock-up period, if any. Different tranches may have varying liquidity terms.



(b)
 The Investment Fund is subject to an investor level gate of 25%. 


(c)
 All of the Funds interests in the Investment Fund are held in side pockets and liquidating trusts which have restricted liquidity.



(d)
 A portion of these holdings have been designated Level 3 because they are not redeemable within 90 days without paying a fee. 


(e)
 The Investment Fund is subject to an investor level gate of 25% monthly during any 90-day period. 
Complete information about the Investment Funds underlying investments is not readily available. 
The Funds valuation procedures require evaluation of all relevant factors available at the time the Fund values its
portfolio. These relevant factors include the individual Investment Funds compliance with fair value measurements, price transparency and valuation procedures in place, and subscription and redemption activity. 
The Funds investments are categorized in three levels as disclosed below. Level 1 discloses the amount of investments
where the values of those investments are based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical investments. Level 2 discloses the amount of investments where the Fund has the ability to redeem in full within one quarter from the measurement date
at the Investment Funds NAV. Level 3 discloses the amount of investments where the Fund does not have the ability to redeem in full within one quarter from the measurement date at the Investment Funds NAV. The Fund does not bifurcate an
investment between Level 2 and Level 3 when there is an investor level gate; therefore if a portion of the investment is determined to be Level 3, the entire holding is classified as a Level 3 investment. Included in Level 3 as of June 30, 2015
is $4,695,364 which relates to the value of a portion of several investments that can be partially redeemed within one quarter from the measurement date. Further liquidity information is contained in the Schedule of Portfolio Investments. There were
no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the period ended June 30, 2015.

Exhibit (a)(1)(v) 
Forms of Letters from the Fund
to Investors in connection with acceptance of offers of tender

UBS Multi-Strat Fund, L.L.C.



This letter is being sent to you if you tendered your entire interest in the
Fund.




Dear Investor:
UBS Multi-Strat Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") has received and
accepted your tender request. Enclosed is a statement showing the breakdown of
your capital withdrawal and the manner in which it is being distributed, in
accordance with the tender offer. 
Since you have tendered your entire investment, you have been
paid 90% of the amount requested, in accordance with the terms of the tender
offer. The funds were wired directly into your UBS Financial Services brokerage
account if you have a UBS Financial Services account. If you do not have a UBS
Financial Services account, the funds were mailed directly in the form of a
check to you at your mailing address as listed in the Fund's records.
The remaining 10% of the amount requested is a contingent
portion of the repurchased interest and is valued based on the unaudited
estimated net asset value of the Fund as of June 30, 2007, and is subject to
year-end audit adjustments which may cause a change in the value of the
contingent portion of the repurchased interest. The contingent portion, together
with interest, will be paid (subject to audit adjustment) within approximately
ten days after the conclusion of the 2007 year-end audit, or on such earlier
date as the Fund's Directors may determine, according to the terms of the tender
offer. We expect the audit to be completed by the end of February 2008.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact the
Fund's Administrator, PFPC Inc., at (877) 431-1973. 
Sincerely,
UBS Multi-Strat Fund, L.L.C.
Enclosure

This letter is being sent to you if you
tendered Interests in the Fund and the Offer was oversubscribed.




Dear Investor:
UBS Multi-Strat Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") has received and
accepted approximately [___]% of your tender request. 
For the tender period ending Friday, June 22, 2007,
approximately $[________] of Interests in the Fund were submitted for redemption
and the offer was oversubscribed. Because of the oversubscription, the Fund will
repurchase from you a pro rata portion of the Interests tendered, or
approximately [___]% of your requested tender amount, in accordance with the
terms of the Fund's Offer to Purchase. Enclosed is a statement showing the
breakdown of your capital withdrawal in accordance with the tender offer.
You have been paid in cash, in accordance with the terms of the
tender offer. The funds were wired directly into your UBS Financial Services
brokerage account. If you do not have a UBS Financial Services account, the
funds were mailed directly in the form of a check to you at your mailing address
as listed in the Fund's records. Please note that because a portion of your
capital remains with the Fund, you are still an investor in the Fund.
As stated in the Offer to Purchase, the Directors of the Fund
have the discretion to determine whether the Fund will repurchase Interests from
investors from time to time pursuant to written tender offers. If authorized by
the Directors, the next tender offer period is expected to commence in November
2007. Investors who wish to have the Fund purchase any Interests not purchased
in the tender offer just concluded must re-tender the Interests in a subsequent
tender offer. 
Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Fund's
Administrator, PFPC Inc., at (877) 431-1973. 
Sincerely,
UBS Multi-Strat Fund, L.L.C.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                                                     (UNAUDITED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2007 TO JUNE 30, 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  ORGANIZATION                                                                

    UBS  Multi-Strat  Fund,  L.L.C.  (the  "Fund")  was  organized  as a limited
    liability  company under the laws of Delaware on July 29, 2004.  The Fund is
    registered  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
    Act"), as a closed-end, non-diversified,  management investment company. The
    Fund's  investment  objective is to seek capital  appreciation over the long
    term. The Fund is a  multi-manager  fund that seeks to achieve its objective
    by deploying its assets among a select group of portfolio  managers who over
    time have produced  attractive returns.  Generally,  such portfolio managers
    conduct their  investment  programs  through  unregistered  investment funds
    (collectively,  the  "Investment  Funds"),  in which the Fund  invests  as a
    limited partner, member or shareholder along with other investors.  The Fund
commenced operations on October 1, 2004.                                

    The Fund's Board of Directors (the  "Directors") has overall  responsibility
    to manage  and  control  the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
    exclusive  authority  to oversee and to  establish  policies  regarding  the
    management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business. The Directors have
    engaged UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C. ("UBSFA", the "Adviser" and, when providing
    services  under  the  Administration  Agreement,  the  "Administrator"),   a
    Delaware limited liability  company,  to provide investment advice regarding
    the selection of Investment  Funds and to be responsible  for the day-to-day
management of the Fund.                                                 

    The Adviser is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of UBS Americas, Inc., which
    is a wholly owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG, and is registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.          

    Initial and additional  applications for interests by eligible investors may
    be accepted at such times as the Adviser  may  determine  and are  generally
    accepted monthly.  The Fund reserves the right to reject any application for
interests in the Fund.                                                  

    The Fund from time to time may offer to  repurchase  interests  pursuant  to
    written tenders to Members. These repurchases will be made at such times and
    on such terms as may be determined by the  Directors,  in their complete and
    exclusive discretion.  The Manager expects that, generally it will recommend
    to the Directors  that the Fund offer to repurchase  interests  from Members
    twice each year,  near mid year and year end.  Members can only  transfer or
    assign their membership interests, or a portion thereof, (i) by operation of
    law  pursuant  to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  dissolution  of a
    Member,  or (ii) with the written  approval of the  Directors,  which may be
    withheld in their sole and absolute  discretion.  Such transfers may be made
    even if the balance of the capital account to such transferee is equal to or
less than the transferor's initial capital contribution.                

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                             
A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION                                                  

    Net asset  value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                                                                     (UNAUDITED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2007 TO JUNE 30, 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                                 
A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)                                      

    determined  from  time to  time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
    Directors.  The Fund's  investments  in Investment  Funds are subject to the
    terms and  conditions of the  respective  operating  agreements and offering
    memoranda,  as appropriate.  The Fund's  investments in Investment Funds are
    carried at fair value as  determined  by the Fund's pro rata interest in the
    net  assets  of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations  utilize  financial
    information  supplied by each  Investment Fund and are net of management and
    performance  incentive fees or allocations  payable to the Investment Funds'
    managers  or  pursuant  to the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The  Fund's
    valuation   procedures   require  the  Adviser  to  consider   all  relevant
    information available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. The Adviser
    and/or the Directors will consider such  information and consider whether it
    is  appropriate,  in light of all  relevant  circumstances,  to value such a
    position at its net asset value as reported or whether to adjust such value.
    The underlying investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for at fair
    value as described in each  Investment  Fund's  financial  statements.  (See
Schedule of Portfolio Investments)                                      

    Distributions  received or withdrawals from Investment Funds, whether in the
    form of  cash  or  securities,  are  first  applied  as a  reduction  of the
investment's cost.                                                      

B. INCOME RECOGNITION                                                   

    Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis.  Realized gains and losses
    from  Investment  Fund  transactions  are calculated on the identified  cost
basis.                                                                  

C. FUND COSTS                                                           

    The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its  business,  including,  but not
    limited  to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to  portfolio
    transactions  and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting
    and auditing fees;  custodial fees;  costs of computing the Fund's net asset
    value;  costs of  insurance;  registration  expenses;  certain  organization
    costs;  due diligence,  including travel and related  expenses;  expenses of
    meetings of Directors and Members;  all costs with respect to communications
    to Members; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors.  Offering
costs are charged to capital as incurred.                               

D. INCOME TAXES                                                         

    No  provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local  income taxes has
    been  provided,  since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each Member is
    individually required to report on its own tax return its distributive share
of the Fund's taxable income or loss.                                   

                                                                               6

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                                                                     (UNAUDITED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2007 TO JUNE 30, 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                                 
E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS                                            

    Cash and cash  equivalents  consist  of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,  NA
    account  that pays money  market  rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
    accrued interest,  which is included in interest receivable on the Statement
of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.                            

F. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS                                                

    From  time to time,  the Fund  may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
    connection with such transactions it is the Fund's policy that its Custodian
    take possession of the underlying collateral  securities,  the fair value of
    which exceeds the principal amount of the repurchase transaction,  including
    accrued interest,  at all times. If the seller defaults,  and the fair value
    of the collateral declines, realization of the collateral by the Fund may be
    delayed  or  limited.  As of  June  30,  2007,  there  were  no  outstanding
repurchase agreements.                                                  

G. USE OF ESTIMATES                                                     

    The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with U.S.  generally
    accepted  accounting  principles  requires the Manager to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    accompanying  notes.  The Manager  believes that the  estimates  utilized in
    preparing  the Fund's  financial  statements  are  reasonable  and  prudent;
however, actual results could differ from these estimates.              

3.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS                                                  

    The Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant to an
    Investment Advisory Agreement.  In consideration for such services, the Fund
    pays the  Adviser a monthly  fee (the "Fund  Asset-Based  Fee") at an annual
    rate of 1.30% of the Fund's net assets, excluding assets attributable to the
    Adviser's  capital  account.   The  Administrator   provides  certain  other
    administrative services to the Fund including, among other things, providing
    office space and other support services. In consideration for such services,
    the Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee (the  "Administrator  Fee") at
    an  annual  rate  of  0.30%  of the  Fund's  net  assets,  excluding  assets
    attributable to the Administrator's  and the Adviser's capital account.  The
    Fund  Asset-Based  Fee will be paid to the Adviser out of the Fund's  assets
    and debited  against the Members'  capital  accounts,  excluding  net assets
    attributable  to the  Adviser's  capital  account.  A  portion  of the  Fund
Asset-Based Fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.                     

    UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
    Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without  special
    compensation  from the Fund, and will bear its own costs associated with its
    activities  as  placement   agent.   Placement  fees,  if  any,  charged  on
    contributions are debited against the contribution amount to arrive at a net
    subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not  constitute  assets of the
Fund.                                                                   

                                                                               7

3.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)                                      

    The net increase (or decrease) in Members'  capital  derived from operations
    (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital  accounts of all Members on
    a pro-rata basis,  other than the Fund Asset-Based Fee and the Administrator
    Fee which are  similarly  allocated to all Members other than the Adviser or
Administrator as described above.                                       

    Each Director of the Fund  receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a fee
    for each meeting attended.  All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund for all
    reasonable  out of  pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed  by the Fund
    related to  Directors  for the period from  January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2007
were $17,009.                                                           

    Other  investment  partnerships  sponsored by UBS Americas or its affiliates
    may also maintain investment  interests in the Investment Funds owned by the
Fund.                                                                   

4.  ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES                                           

    PFPC Trust  Company (an  affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as the custodian
    (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides  custodial  services for
the Fund.                                                               

    PFPC Inc.  (also an  affiliate  of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as  Accounting  and
    Investor  Servicing Agent to the Fund and in that capacity  provides certain
    administrative, accounting, record keeping, tax and Member related services.
    PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee  primarily  based upon (i) the average net
    assets of the Fund subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and (ii) the aggregate
    net assets of the Fund and  certain  other  investment  funds  sponsored  or
    advised by UBS  Americas,  Inc. or its  affiliates.  Additionally,  the Fund
reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.         

5.  CREDIT FACILITY                                                             

    Effective  July 1, 2006 the Fund,  along  with  other UBS  sponsored  funds,
    entered into a $200,000,000  committed,  unsecured  revolving line of credit
    with Harris Trust and Savings Bank. Under the most restrictive  arrangement,
    the Fund may borrow an amount that combined with the other borrowings of the
    Fund would not exceed 20% of its net assets.  The Fund's borrowing  capacity
    is also  limited to the portion of the unused line of credit at any point in
    time.  The Fund is only liable under the line of credit to the extent of its
    own  borrowing  there under.  The interest rate on the borrowing is based on
    the Federal Funds rate plus 150 basis points per annum.  The expiration date
    of such credit  agreements  is July 31, 2007.  The  committed  facility also
    requires  a fee to be paid by the Fund,  on a pro rata  basis,  based on the
    amount of the aggregate commitment,  which has not been utilized of 25 basis
    points per annum.  For the period from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2007, the
    Fund's average  interest rate paid on borrowings was 6.75% per annum and the
    average borrowings  outstanding were $1,002,265.  The Fund had $8,340,000 in
    borrowings  outstanding  at June 30, 2007.  Interest  expense for the period
    from  January  1, 2007 to June 30,  2007 was  $34,014,  of which  $3,128 was
    payable  at  the  end  of the  period.  See  Subsequent  Event  for  further
information.

6.  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS                                                     

    Aggregate  purchases  and proceeds  from sales of  Investment  Funds for the
    period from  January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2007  amounted to  $32,500,000  and

    The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax  purposes is adjusted  for
    items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment Funds. The
    allocated  taxable income is reported to the Fund by the Investment Funds on

    The  agreements  related to  investments  in  Investment  Funds  provide for
    compensation to the general partners/managers in the form of management fees
    of between 1% and 2.5% (per annum) of net assets and  performance  incentive
    fees or allocations  ranging from 20% to 25% of net profits  earned.  One or
    more   underlying  fund   investments   have  entered  into  a  side  pocket
arrangement.                                                            

8.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK                           

    In the normal  course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the Fund
    invests  trade  various   financial   instruments  and  enter  into  various
    investment  activities with off-balance  sheet risk. These include,  but are
    not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,   writing  option  contracts,
    contracts  for  differences,  and equity  swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in
    these  Investment  Funds is  limited  to the value of these  investments  as
reported by the Fund.                                                   

9.  INDEMNIFICATION                                                             

    In the  ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into  contracts or
    agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties.  Future events could
    occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Fund. Based
    on its history and experience,  management feels that the likelihood of such
an event is remote.

10. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS                                               

    On September 20, 2006, the FASB released  Statement of Financial  Accounting
    Standards No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157 establishes
    an  authoritative  definition  of  fair  value,  sets  out a  framework  for
    measuring fair value, and requires  additional  disclosures about fair-value
    measurements.  The  application  of FAS 157 is  required  for  fiscal  years
    beginning  after  November 15, 2007 and interim  periods within those fiscal
    years.  At this time,  management is evaluating the  implications of FAS 157
and its impact on the financial statements has not yet been determined.

Summary of Risk Factors
You should read the prospectus carefully for a description of the risks associated with an investment in JLL Income Property Trust. Some of these risks include but are not limited to the following:

Since there is no public trading market for shares of our common stock, repurchases of shares by us after a one-year minimum holding period will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares.
After a required one-year holding period, we limit the amount of shares that may be repurchased under our repurchase plan to approximately 5% of our net asset value (NAV) per quarter and 20% of our NAV per annum. Because our assets will consist primarily of properties that generally cannot be readily liquidated, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to satisfy repurchase requests. Further, our Board of Directors may modify or suspend our repurchase plan if it deems such action to be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, our shares have limited liquidity and at times may be illiquid.
The purchase and redemption price for shares of our common stock will be based on the NAV of each class of common stock and will not be based on any public trading market. Because valuation of properties is inherently subjective, our NAV may not accurately reflect the actual price at which our assets could be liquidated on any given day.
We are dependent on our advisor to conduct our operations. We will pay substantial fees to our advisor, which increases your risk of loss.
We have a history of operating losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.
Our advisor will face conflicts of interest as a result of, among other things, time constraints, allocation of investment opportunities, and the fact that the fees it will receive for services rendered to us will be based on our NAV, which it is responsible for calculating.
The amount of distributions we make is uncertain and there is no assurance that future distributions will be made. We may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, the sale of assets, borrowings, or offering proceeds.
Our use of leverage increases the risk of your investment.
If we fail to maintain our status as a REIT, and no relief provisions apply, we would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences that would cause a significant reduction in our cash available for distribution to our stockholders and potentially have a negative impact on our NAV.

These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” and other similar terms, including references to assumptions and forecasts of future results.
