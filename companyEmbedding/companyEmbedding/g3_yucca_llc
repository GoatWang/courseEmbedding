        Works If You Work It!
I've tried SO many different gels & stylers and this one works best for me! Great slip when applying, very moisturizing, beautiful curl definition, firm hold (which I need), no flakes after it dries, and great shine! It does not leave my hair dry and dull looking like other gels have. Don't let the thin consistency fool you; it works if you work it. I apply it to my hair while it is soaking wet, with only a liquid leave-in underneath (Obia Naturals Curl Hydration Spray), then let it air dry. The result is shiny, well-defined curls that can last all week by refreshing with water, more Curl Hydration Spray, and reapplication of only a small amount of this gel to my trouble areas. I've found that layering this product with creams, lotions, or anything other than a thin, liquid leave-in will decrease its effectiveness. It does leave my hair a little crunchy, but I don't mind because for me crunch = lasting hold and no frizz, and the crunch wears off. When I rinse the gel out, my hair is soft. Another tip - I add just a tad of eco styler olive oil gel on top of this gel (while hair is wet) when the weather is especially humid outside - this combination works wonders at fighting frizz (eco styler alone doesn't work for me and is too drying).

        Love this gel!
I love this gel. It's my favorite. Glides on and is very silly but adheres to my hair. Provides it with wonderful shine and less frizz. I also love the smell of it. My hair has never looked better. Please do not discontinue this product. I'm able to do day 2-3 hair with some water, small reapplication, and scrunching. I have 3B curly hair.

        Works as Described  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product
Love this gel. I have thin frizzy 3c hair and it gives me perfect curls. Works great in humid weather. Perfect hold, a little crunchy at first and as the day goes on my hair gets softer. I will reorder again.

        it's OK, but not wonderful
I wanted to love the product, but like i have mentioned before for some reason the gels and mousse don't work well for my hair. When you 1st apply it on the hair it doesn't feel soft, later on my hair was getting hard and felt like hay :x i had to apply a little bit of oil to make the hair softer and touchable, after that it was ok but not great. :(
