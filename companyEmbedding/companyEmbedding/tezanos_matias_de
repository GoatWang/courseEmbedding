Matias de Tezanos’ BrokersWeb.com Makes Inc. 500

by Adam Strong in Categories: 
                        People 

After watching an interview on MO.com with Brent Beshore, an Inc 500 entrepreneur, I cruised over to Inc.com and noticed another familiar name in the list of the fastest growing companies.  Matias de Tezanos and his company BrokerWeb.com ranked #20 in the 2011 Inc 500issue. The company saw a 3 year growth of 8,127% with 2010 Revenues of $15.7 million.
Tezanos has has a stellar track record as an entrepreneur starting his career at the age of 20 launching Hoteles.com (sold to Expedia in 2002). He also sold his company ClickDiario.com to Livedoor.com which later sold to NewsCorp in 2007. ClickDiario was rated one of the top 10 largest Spanish networks at the time of the sale with over 25 million monthly users.  The company portfolio included incredible domains such as Deportes.com (Sports), Salud.com (Health), Mujer.com (Women), Mascotas.com (Pets), Boletines.com (Newsletters), Dietas.com (Diets), and Tarjetas.com (Greeting Cards).
His current company BrokersWeb.com, runs a dozen niche sites mostly focused on insurance products on some great domains including Healthcare.com, AutoInsuranceFinders.com and LifeInsurance.org.  Tezanos is also an investor in DomainHoldings.
If you haven’t heard of Tezanos, you may want to read some history from a 2005 DnJournal story.
Congrats Matias and BrokerWeb.com

COMPANY PROFILE
Company: BrokersWeb.com
2012 Inc. 5000 Rank: 50
Headquarters: Miami, FL Year Founded: 2007 2011 Revenue: $54.5 million
3-Year Growth: 4,562%
Website: BrokersWeb.com 








In 2000, Matias de Tezanos, then 20, dropped out of college to start Hoteles.com, a hotel reservation site for Spanish-speaking users. Two years later, Expedia acquired the company. Next, de Tezanos launched ClickDiario.com, an online advertising network. News Corporation bought the company in 2007; it now operates as a division of Fox International Channels. De Tezanos was eager to start another company, but his noncompete agreement barred him from reentering the Latin American market. So he started an insurance marketing company, BrokersWeb, which operates 12 sites (HealthCare.com and AutoInsuranceFinders.com are the largest), on which insurance carriers can advertise and users can compare plans. "I knew nothing about insurance four years ago," de Tezanos says. "It's growing even faster than I thought."

            Work Experience
          

Summary
I think that the best things in life are free. Avid reader. Family guy. Blessed and incredible life.

I like to start projects and companies, I have a blast doing it. I self-ignite. 

At the age of 20 (2000), I dropped out of college and founded the travel site Hoteles.com, which became one of the leading hotel reservations sites targeting Spanish speaking Internet users worldwide. Acquired by Expedia in 2002.

In 2002 I co-founded a company that sells advertising across popular websites in Latin America; ClickDiario. Our team was so fantastic that 2 years after starting the company, we end up reaching 6 out of 10 Spanish speaking users worldwide, turning it into the largest online advertising network in Latin America. Acquired by .FOX Networks (Newscorp) in 2006.

In 2006 I started a private equity firm now called PeopleFund, investing in early and growth stage Internet companies; crazy, dangerous, chaos, non sense, plans always change, however, seeing how many great things are built by all the amazing people running those projects and companies is a lot of fun for me.

In 2008 my partners and I acquired a company called BrokersWeb, when it was a small startup. We grew the company 100X in 3 years. We had an incredible team. During both 2011 and 2012, BrokersWeb was ranked America's fastest growing insurance marketing company in revenue growth by INC 500 magazine. In 2011 we sold BrokersWeb to VantageMedia creating one of the largest and fastest growing internet marketing companies in the US.

After 2 years playing VC and exploring what to do next, in September of 2013 I decided to start a new company: AutoWeb.com. Working hard on it now, here we go again =)
