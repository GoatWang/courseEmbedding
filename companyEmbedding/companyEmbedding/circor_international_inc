CIRCOR Acquires Critical Flow Solutions | Business Wire
























































CIRCOR Acquires Critical Flow Solutions




Provider of Severe-Service Valves with Significant Aftermarket 
      Sales.


Acquisition Expands Presence in Downstream O&G.


Company to Host Conference Call Today at 10:00 am ET.






October 13, 2016 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BURLINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CIRCOR 
      International, Inc. (NYSE: CIR), a leading provider of valves 
      and other highly engineered products for markets including oil & gas, 
      power generation and aerospace & defense, today announced that it has 
      signed a definitive agreement to acquire Critical Flow Solutions (CFS) 
      for $210 million. The Utah-based company manufactures critical 
      severe-service equipment for refining operations. CFS recorded revenue 
      of approximately $120 million with EBITDA margins over 20% for the 
      fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The acquisition is anticipated to close 
      shortly and become accretive in the first 12 months of combined 
      operations. CIRCOR plans to use its existing credit facility to finance 
      the acquisition.
    


      “We are very excited to welcome the CFS team to CIRCOR,” said Scott 
      Buckhout, President and Chief Executive Officer of CIRCOR International. 
      “This acquisition diversifies CIRCOR’s revenue base as we further 
      penetrate the stable downstream refining market. CFS brings an 
      impressive portfolio of high technology valves and automation equipment 
      for severe-service applications. CFS generates strong margins due to its 
      unique technology, large installed base, and high proportion of 
      aftermarket sales.”
    

      This transaction is expected to:
    


        Add differentiated technology and leading positions in niche markets 
        with high barriers to entry;
      

        Broaden CIRCOR’s revenue base by expanding its presence in the stable 
        downstream refining end market;
      

        Provide earnings accretion with strong margins;
      

        Increase exposure to high margin aftermarket sales to support a large 
        installed base; and
      

        Offer opportunities for significant cost synergies.
      


      “CFS has highly differentiated products, strong patent protection, and 
      an excellent track record of developing and commercializing new 
      products,” added Buckhout. “We look forward to working with the CFS team 
      to continue providing excellent service to our customers and capitalize 
      on the growth opportunities in this market.”
    

      Critical Flow Solutions delivers a range of products and services to the 
      petroleum refining industry. The DeltaValve brand is the market leader 
      and offers solutions for the delayed coking process in refineries. The 
      TapcoEnpro brand provides market leading solutions for the fluid 
      catalytic cracking process in refineries. CFS has a total of 
      approximately 200 employees at its Salt Lake City, Utah headquarters, 
      Houston, Texas facilities and Barnsley, UK service center. CIRCOR 
      expects to operate the newly acquired business as part of the Energy 
      Group.
    

      CIRCOR plans to discuss the acquisition of Critical Flow Solutions on a 
      conference call today at 10:00 a.m. ET. To listen to the live conference 
      call and view the accompanying presentation slides, please visit “Webcasts 
      & Presentations” in the “Investors”
