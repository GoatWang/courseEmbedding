Advantage from Perspective
Long-term investment success demands a focus on essential truths that are not always obvious. We focus on investing in companies with the enduring elements that create value: free cash flow and managements committed to providing positive returns to shareholders. Like the companies in which we invest, we are committed to transparency. This includes sharing our global market perspectives and insights that help drive our investment decisions.






OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

	Investors often view a company through the prism of accounting measures such as price-to-book value and price-to-earnings ratios. Epoch adopts a different approach. Earnings growth and dividends drive shareholder returns, and they come from a single source: cash flow. We focus on companies that are growing free cash flow and allocating it intelligently.

	Reinvesting cash flows in internal projects or acquisitions is preferred when those actions will generate returns above the cost of capital. Otherwise, we believe company managements should return excess cash to shareholders through dividends, share buybacks or debt repayments -- collectively known as "shareholder yield."

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY
INVESTMENT PROCESS






INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY
Our investment strategy reflects the changing hierarchy of the three determinants of equity investment returns: earnings, dividends, and P/E multiples.
Historical perspective 
Over time, the relative importance of these three determinants has changed dramatically in response to changes in the economic landscape. In the 1980s and 1990s, for example, rising P/E ratios were the principal drivers of equity returns, leading to the popularity of valuation methodologies that reflected price-to-book value and price-to-earnings metrics. Underlying this 20-year P/E expansion was a collapse in interest rates. Beginning in June 2003, however, this two-decade period of declining interest rates and expanding P/E ratios showed signs of coming to an end. We believe we have entered a period in which P/E ratios are more likely to contract than expand as interest rates begin to rise rather than fall from recent historic lows. Given the inverse relationship of P/E ratios to interest rates, the expansion of P/E multiples will no longer be the primary explanatory variable of equity returns. This leaves earnings growth and dividends, the two variables that have been the dominant sources of equity returns over the past 80 years. These two variables are derived from a single source: cash flow.



Components of Equity Returns by Decade (S&P 500 Index 1927-2015)


A Focus on Cash Flow
Epoch’s security selection process is thus focused on free-cash-flow metrics as opposed to traditional accounting-based metrics. In our view, the key to producing superior risk-adjusted equity returns is the identification of companies with a consistent ability to both generate free cash flow and to properly allocate it among internal reinvestment opportunities, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and debt repayments. The determination of how to deploy free cash flow should be guided by the company’s cost of capital. Acquisitions and reinvestments should only be undertaken when the return on capital is greater than the firm’s average cost of capital. Otherwise, free cash flow should be returned to shareholders via the other three uses: dividends, share buybacks and debt repayments. Epoch defines these three uses of free cash flow as “Shareholder Yield.”

How Corporations Allocate Free Cash Flow


Stock Selection 
Before making an investment, we analyze a company as if we were looking to purchase the entire business. We invest in businesses with understandable operating models, transparent financial statements, and a proven ability to generate free cash flow. We also seek securities that, in our view, have unrecognized potential. Risk controls are integrated in both the security selection and portfolio construction process in order to manage aggregation risk exposures and increase the efficiency of the portfolio in terms of risk versus reward.

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY
INVESTMENT PROCESS






INVESTMENT PROCESS
Our goal is to produce an efficient portfolio on a risk/return basis. We undertake detailed fundamental research on individual companies, diversify across attractive companies and economic sectors, limit individual holding sizes, and employ a strict sell discipline. If we have identified a good business at a good price, time is our ally as patient investors. As a result, we have relatively low portfolio turnover in most strategies. Epoch’s Investment Policy Group, representing the most experienced members of the investment team, provides a macro-level perspective that portfolio managers may use as a context when evaluating individual companies and sectors. This is combined with rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis that incorporates the following components:
Analyze the Business:
Determine the sustainability of the business, earnings drivers, barriers to entry, and competitive advantages.
Understand the Cash Flow Structure:
Focus on companies that generate cash earnings and assess the quality and character of those earnings to determine the net cash flow from the business.
Relate Cash Flow to Enterprise Value:
Examine relevant claims against net cash flow and determine the necessity of these claims to maintain and grow the business. Evaluate how management will use free cash flow. Value the cash flow stream and compare it to enterprise value to determine the attractiveness of the investment.
Evaluate Management Quality:
Identify managements with the intention and demonstrated ability to create shareholder value.
Seek Unrecognized Assets:
Uncover, where possible, hidden, undervalued or underutilized assets, especially in under-researched small- and mid-cap companies.
Manage Risk:
Risk management is integrated into each step of the investment process. We have a team dedicated to quantitative research and risk management, ensuring that the portfolio construction process takes into account aggregation risks and diversification objectives. The goal is twofold: first, to minimize stock-specific risk through greater diversification, and second, to avoid unintended risks or biases at the portfolio level. Our Chief Risk Officer is a co-portfolio manager of every strategy we offer. As a result, the lead portfolio manager is continually aware of these risks. While the research and security selection methodology is the starting point for all of Epoch's equity strategies, the portfolio construction process is adaptable to the specific parameters of each investment strategy and our clients’ individual guidelines.

Epoch Global Equity Yield Portfolio

Investment Overview
Epoch Investment Partners, Inc. ("Epoch") seeks to provide a high level of income by investing in a globally diversified portfolio of stocks with a history of attractive dividends and positive growth in free cash flow which may be used to pay future dividends.
Investment Process
Epoch utilizes an investment discipline that combines bottom-up stock research with top-down analysis. The investment team analyzes companies, regardless of domicile, based on in-house research, similar to the approach taken by private investors. They invest in businesses they understand, that meet their strict Free Cash Flow criteria, possess high dividend yields, and that can be purchased at an attractive price.
In determining the risk/reward profile of a company, Epoch may evaluate the sustainability of the company's business, the company's earnings drivers, barriers to entry for potential competitors, the quality and character of the company's cash earnings, and the likelihood of the company's management to use free cash flow to enhance shareholder value, among other factors. The portfolio is comprised of global stocks exhibiting strong free cash flow growth and providing for high dividend yields.

Complements TD Asset Management's existing capabilities


Immediately and significantly advances organic growth strategy for TD's
 North American Wealth business



TORONTO, Dec. 6, 2012 /PRNewswire/ - TD (TD) (TSX and NYSE:   TD) and Epoch
 Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:   EPHC) including its subsidiary Epoch
 Investment Partners, Inc. today announced that they have signed a
 definitive agreement under which Epoch will be acquired by TD Bank
 Group for approximately US$668 million, in an all-cash transaction.
 Epoch Holding Corporation shareholders will receive US$28.00 in cash
 per share, representing a premium of approximately 28 per cent to
 Epoch's closing price on December 5, 2012.


"We've been looking for an opportunity to acquire a U.S. asset manager
 to build our North American Wealth business, which is a key growth area
 for TD," said Mike Pedersen, Group Head, Wealth Management, Insurance
 and Corporate Shared Services, TD. "This acquisition makes strategic
 sense for TD.  It will broaden our offer for institutional and retail
 clients in Canada and will immediately and significantly strengthen our
 U.S. Wealth business."



Epoch is a highly successful asset management firm with an excellent
 record of investment performance and an extremely strong and
 experienced management team. Epoch's investment strategies have
 exceeded their performance benchmarks over the past five years and
 their thought leadership in the investment community is well
 recognized. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in New York City, Epoch
 has 65 employees. Their asset management team has an average of over 20
 years of investment management experience.


"The combination of our two firms, which share compatible cultures and
 complementary investment disciplines, will help us better serve clients
 on both sides of the border. Epoch will enable TD Asset Management to
 substantially broaden our expertise in U.S. and global equities," said
 Brian Murdock, Chairman & CEO, TD Asset Management. "This transaction
 represents an excellent opportunity for both Epoch and TD Asset
 Management to build on our respective strengths to solve client needs."


"Epoch is pleased to be joining forces with TD, whose financial strength
 will enhance our competitive advantage as we continue to deepen and
 expand our capabilities," said William W. Priest, CEO, Epoch Investment
 Partners, Inc. "We are confident that this transaction will strengthen
 Epoch's existing franchise and further support our client focused
 efforts. Our investment management philosophy aligns with TD's
 long-term strategy. This transaction allows us to combine Epoch's U.S.
 and global equities expertise with TD's client-centric approach."


Epoch Holding Corporation's Board of Directors has unanimously
 recommended this transaction to their shareholders for approval.
 Members of Epoch Holding Corporation's management team and Board of
 Directors, who currently hold approximately 28 per cent of the
 company's outstanding shares, have demonstrated their support for the
 transaction by agreeing to vote such shares in favor of the
 transaction.


With this transaction, TD expects to add approximately US$24 billion in
 assets under management at closing to the US$207 billion already under
 management by TD Asset Management. Following the completion of the
 transaction, Epoch will continue to operate and serve clients under its
 current brand name and operating structure.


Additional details of the transaction 


Subject to the approval of Epoch Holding Corporation's stockholders,
 receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary
 closing conditions for a transaction of this type, this transaction is
 expected to close in the first half of 2013. The acquisition is
 expected to have minimal impact on TD's earnings in fiscal 2013 and to
 be accretive in fiscal 2014.  At closing, TD's Basel III Common Equity
 Tier 1 ratio is expected to decrease by approximately 24 basis points
 on a pro forma basis as at TD's last quarter ending October 31, 2012 as
 a result of the transaction.


Investor information:


TD will briefly discuss this transaction during its fourth quarter
 results call which will be audio webcast live at www.td.com/investor/ at 3:00 p.m. ET today.  The presentation material referenced during the
 call will be available on the website at www.td.com/investor/calendar_arch.jsp. A listen-only telephone line will be available at 416-644-3415 or

 objectives and priorities for 2013 and beyond and strategies to achieve
 them, and TD's anticipated financial performance. Forward-looking
 statements are typically identified by words such as "will", "should",
 "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "intend", "estimate", "plan", "may",
 and "could".


By their very nature, these statements require TD to make assumptions
 and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and
 specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the
 financial, economic, political and regulatory environments, such risks
 and uncertainties - many of which are beyond TD's control and the
 effects of which can be difficult to predict - may cause actual results
 to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the
 forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause such
 differences include: credit, market (including equity, commodity,
 foreign exchange, and interest rate), liquidity, operational (including
 technology), reputational, insurance, strategic, regulatory, legal,
 environmental, capital adequacy and other risks, all of which are
 discussed in TD's 2012 Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A").


With regard to TD's proposed acquisition of Epoch, there can be no
 assurance that TD will realize the anticipated benefits or results of
 the acquisition due to a variety of factors, including: inability to
 complete the acquisition in the timeframe anticipated, obtain client or
 regulatory approvals of the transaction, obtain approval of the
 transaction by Epoch Holding Corporation stockholders, or satisfy other
 closing conditions to the transaction on the proposed terms and
 timeframe; difficulties or delays in integrating Epoch or higher than
 anticipated integration costs; lower than anticipated assets under
 management, inability to maintain significant advisory relationships,
 lower than anticipated margins, and lower than anticipated new client
 account origination.


We caution that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible
 risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect TD's
 results. For additional information, please see the "Risk Factors and
 Management" section of the 2012 MD&A.  TD's material general economic
 assumptions are set out in TD's 2012 MD&A under the heading "Economic
 Summary and Outlook" and for each of the business segments under the
 heading "Business Outlook and Focus for 2013".


All such factors should be considered carefully, as well as other
 uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of
 forward-looking statements, when making decisions with respect to TD
 and we caution readers not to place undue reliance on TD's
 forward-looking statements.


Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release represent
 the views of management only as of the date hereof and are presented
 for the purpose of assisting TD's shareholders and analysts in
 understanding TD's financial position, objectives and priorities and
 anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on
 the dates presented, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. TD
 does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether
 written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on its
 behalf, except as required under applicable securities legislation.

Save a little more today, 


	  

	  for the things you’ll love forever.

	  
Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html

Unexpected
LOSS OF
INCOME


You're already challenged to generate retirement income that could last 20 or 30 years. But if you're a surviving spouse or partner, you may also have to replace the loss of expected income, which could include Social Security and pension benefits.

TAXES


The higher your tax rate in retirement, the more you'll have to withdraw from your investments to meet your retirement income target.

AND HEALTH

Advantage from Perspective
Long-term investment success demands a focus on essential truths that are not always obvious. We focus on investing in companies with the enduring elements that create value: free cash flow and managements committed to providing positive returns to shareholders. Like the companies in which we invest, we are committed to transparency. This includes sharing our global market perspectives and insights that help drive our investment decisions.






OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

	Investors often view a company through the prism of accounting measures such as price-to-book value and price-to-earnings ratios. Epoch adopts a different approach. Earnings growth and dividends drive shareholder returns, and they come from a single source: cash flow. We focus on companies that are growing free cash flow and allocating it intelligently.

	Reinvesting cash flows in internal projects or acquisitions is preferred when those actions will generate returns above the cost of capital. Otherwise, we believe company managements should return excess cash to shareholders through dividends, share buybacks or debt repayments -- collectively known as "shareholder yield."
