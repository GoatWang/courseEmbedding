Bondtesters
Find ball shear and wafer bond strength test equipment at Nordson
Bond strength testers help electronics manufacturers improve quality control and ensure the integrity of connections. Nordson DAGE  understands the importance of checking every single bond accurately, and making adjustments to increase end-product reliability. Our bondtesters check the strength of attachments in electronic devices through a variety of tests including wafer, wire pull, ball shear, tweezer pull and several others. With Nordson bonding tests incorporated into your quality control process, you’ll gain enhanced confidence in the performance of your finished product. In addition to this equipment, be sure to browse our other quality-control products, including x-ray inspection equipment  and Nordson YESTECH automated optical inspection (AOI) equipment.
