Smead Strategies
Our investment strategies are governed by three primary beliefs that are the bedrock of our investment philosophy.

Valuation matters dearly. Academic studies show that securities purchased at a discount provide enhanced return possibilities to investors.
We are business owners on behalf of our clients. We believe portfolio turnover is the enemy of investors because of frictional costs and the likelihood it makes them regularly exit what could have been the investor’s best performing securities.
We seek out high-quality businesses. It is our belief that long-duration investment success in common stocks is far more likely to come from businesses that have succeeded in the past.

Our investment philosophy plays out in our firm’s eight investment criteria.
 Eight Investment Criteria

Our portfolio managers evaluate and purchase stocks based on the following Eight Investment Criteria:  
Required over the entire holding period 
1. Meets an economic need  2. Strong competitive advantage (wide moats or barriers to entry)3. Long history of profitability and strong operating metrics 4. Generates high levels of free cash flow  5. Available at a low price in relation to intrinsic value  
Favored, but not required 
6. Management's history of shareholder friendliness 7. Strong balance sheet 8. Strong insider ownership (preferably with recent purchases)  
Every company we own must satisfy the required criteria. For companies that do not also meet the favored criteria, we believe these short-term conditions will be ultimately corrected or overwhelmed by the required criteria.    
Sell Criteria 
Companies are sold if they deviate significantly from these criteria or if their stock price becomes unreasonable due to dramatic price appreciation in relation to underlying fundamentals. When a security falls 15-20% from our purchase price or relative to a peer group, the portfolio managers execute a formal, intensified review.

How we'll work with you:
 Advisors

Our firm has deep roots in the investment advisory business through the careers of our experienced staff. We understand the careful balance you have to strike between knowing what’s right for the client and getting the client to act on your prudent advice. We believe our firm’s thought leadership in the missives, quarterly newsletters and media appearances we publish help level that precise balance.
We seek to partner with advisors whether they are registered investment advisors or financial advisors of a broker dealer organization. Advisors can access our firm’s investment strategy through separately managed accounts (SMA), wrap accounts, sub-advisory or our mutual funds.
Connect with Us 


 Family Offices

Family wealth is amassed through long-term ownership of both publicly-traded and privately held companies. Those who have built wealth slowly have already exercised a demeanor that leads to interest in our firm’s philosophy and strategy. Whether you are the patriarch/matriarch overseeing the wealth of your relatives or an advisor providing due diligence and trust to a group of families you work with, we are here to serve the wealth creation needs that you have by taking risk in the common stocks of durational businesses.
We seek to work for and with single-family offices and multi-family offices. Both single- and multi-family offices can access our firm’s investment strategies through separately managed accounts (SMA), wrap accounts, sub-advisory or our mutual funds.
Connect with Us 


 Institutional Investors

Institutional Investors, whether they be foundations, endowments, defined benefit, Taft-Hartley or 401(k) plans, have needs that must be filled based on the particular mandate of their organization or the participants they represent. We understand the role our firm can perform, for these institutions as well as the consulting firms that advise them, through the long-duration common stock strategy that we manage on behalf of our investors.
We seek to work for institutional investors directly or through their investment committees and consultants. Institutional investors and plans can access our firm’s investment strategies through separately managed accounts (SMA), sub-advisory mandates or our mutual funds.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
