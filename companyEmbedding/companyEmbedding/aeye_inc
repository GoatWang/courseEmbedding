AEye Expands Executive Team as Growth AcceleratesSeasoned Engineering, Product and Business Executives to Drive Development and Commercialization of AEye's Advanced Vision Systems for Autonomous VehiclesPLEASANTON, CA, June 28, 2017 - AEye Inc, a robotic vision pioneer, today announced it has expanded its executive team to accelerate development and deployment of its “pre-fused” solid state LiDAR and computer vision systems for autonomous vehicles. This follows the company’s recent $16 million series A funding announcement from Kleiner Perkins, Airbus Ventures, Intel Capital and others. The new hires include renowned defense scientist Dr. Allan Steinhardt as chief engineer, semiconductor industry veteran John Stockton as VP of product, and accomplished business strategist Blair LaCorte as chief of staff. The executives round out a seasoned management team with deep technical experience developing complex and reliable software enabling electro-optic solutions for military and civilian deployments.“We are thrilled to bring on Allan, John and Blair, each of whom are leaders in their respective fields,” said Luis Dussan, CEO of AEye. “These executives’ credentials and expertise will be invaluable to AEye’s growth and development as the company looks to lead the charge in delivering truly intelligent vision systems that advance vehicle autonomy.”AEye’s advanced vision system combines proprietary LiDAR and computer vision with artificial intelligence and customized software to enable a new level of safety for operators and passengers of autonomous or driver-assisted vehicles. The system scans a scene, intelligently focusing on information content. By having a visual cortex behind the “eyes” of the vehicle that digests information quickly, AEye greatly improves reliability. At the same time, AEye’s solid state system, which uses a 1550 nanometer retina-safe laser, reduces bandwidth and improves performance to enable fast control loops through improved perception. New Hires Round Out Seasoned TeamAs chief engineer, Dr. Allan Steinhardt will help lead AEye’s technical innovation, developing the company’s core competencies as it seeks to accelerate the arrival of safe and reliable autonomous vehicles.

Dr. Steinhardt holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, and master’s and PhD degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder. He is an IEEE fellow and a member of the Naval Science Board at the National Academies of Science.As VP of product, John Stockton will be in charge of overseeing AEye’s product development, working closely with AEye’s technologists and customers to ensure product excellence. Stockton is an entrepreneur and seasoned semiconductor executive with a track record of taking products to market and scaling production. His past CEO roles include ARC International, a semiconductor intellectual property company; Synergy Semiconductor, a maker of high-speed bipolar ICs; and Stream Machine, an MPEG-2 codec maker. He was also the founder of SVision, as well as a fellow at VLSI, where he co-created the company's PC Chip-Set Division, and organized ARM Ltd., a UK-based processor design and intellectual property licensing company. Stockton has been a venture partner at both Mayfield Fund and Autotech Ventures, where he focused on semiconductor/MEMS/EDA and automotive sectors, respectively. John holds a Bachelor’s degree in nuclear and electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin.As chief of staff, Blair LaCorte will be responsible for planning and executing key organizational objectives.

VC-backed AEye adds three to team


June 28, 2017
By Iris Dorbian






Pleasanton, California-based AEye Inc, a developer of advanced vision hardware, software and algorithms for self-driving vehicles, has beefed up its team with three new hires. Joining the company are John Stockton as vice president of product, Dr. Allan Steinhardt as chief engineer and Blair LaCorte as chief of staff. AEye’s backers include Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Airbus Ventures and Intel Capital.
PRESS RELEASE
PLEASANTON, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–AEye Inc, a robotic vision pioneer, today announced it has expanded its executive team to accelerate development and deployment of its “pre-fused” solid state LiDAR and computer vision systems for autonomous vehicles. This follows the company’s recent $16 million series A funding announcement from Kleiner Perkins, Airbus Ventures, Intel Capital and others. The new hires include renowned defense scientist Dr. Allan Steinhardt as chief engineer, semiconductor industry veteran John Stockton as VP of product, and accomplished business strategist Blair LaCorte as chief of staff. The executives round out a seasoned management team with deep technical experience developing complex and reliable software-enabling electro-optic solutions for military and civilian deployments.
“We are thrilled to bring on Allan, John and Blair, each of whom are leaders in their respective fields,” said Luis Dussan, CEO of AEye. “These executives’ credentials and expertise will be invaluable to AEye’s growth and development as the company looks to lead the charge in delivering truly intelligent vision systems that advance vehicle autonomy.” 





AEye’s advanced vision system combines proprietary LiDAR and computer vision with artificial intelligence and customized software to enable a new level of safety for operators and passengers of autonomous or driver-assisted vehicles. The system scans a scene, intelligently focusing on information content. By having a visual cortex behind the “eyes” of the vehicle that digests information quickly, AEye greatly improves reliability. At the same time, AEye’s solid state system, which uses a 1550 nanometer retina-safe laser, reduces bandwidth and improves performance to enable fast control loops through improved perception.
New Hires Round Out Seasoned Team
As chief engineer, Dr. Allan Steinhardt will help lead AEye’s technical innovation, developing the company’s core competencies as it seeks to accelerate the arrival of safe and reliable autonomous vehicles. Dr. Steinhardt formerly served as a chief scientist at DARPA, where he conducted leading-edge work on space, land, and naval-based electronic warfare, sensor, and radar systems. He previously served as a vice president and chief scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton, radar project lead at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and director of signal processing for the defense industry at BAE/Alphatech.
In academia, Steinhardt served as assistant professor of electrical engineering and applied mathematics at Cornell University, where he performed funded research on sensor arrays and optimal detection capabilities. Dr. Steinhardt holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, and master’s and PhD degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder. He is an IEEE fellow and a member of the Naval Science Board at the National Academies of Science. 





As VP of product, John Stockton will be in charge of overseeing AEye’s product development, working closely with AEye’s technologists and customers to ensure product excellence. Stockton is an entrepreneur and seasoned semiconductor executive with a track record of taking products to market and scaling production. His past CEO roles include ARC International, a semiconductor intellectual property company; Synergy Semiconductor, a maker of high-speed bipolar ICs; and Stream Machine, an MPEG-2 codec maker. He was also the founder of SVision, as well as a fellow at VLSI, where he co-created the company’s PC Chip-Set Division, and organized ARM Ltd., a UK-based processor design and intellectual property licensing company. Stockton has been a venture partner at both Mayfield Fund and Autotech Ventures, where he focused on semiconductor/MEMS/EDA and automotive sectors, respectively. John holds a Bachelor’s degree in nuclear and electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin.
As chief of staff, Blair LaCorte will be responsible for planning and executing key organizational objectives. Blair is an accomplished leader and strategist with a long history of leveraging his change management skills to drive operational alignment and growth within companies. Most recently, LaCorte served as global president of PRG, the world’s largest live event technology and services company, CEO of XOJET, one of the fastest growing aviation companies in history and the largest private charter company in North America, and operating partner at TPG, a premier private equity firm with over $58B in global investments. LaCorte has also held numerous executive and general management positions in private and public technology companies including VerticalNet, Savi Technologies, Autodesk and Sun Microsystems. LaCorte graduated summa cum laude from the University of Maine and holds an MBA from Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, where he later served as an executive fellow at the Center for Digital Strategies. He has received numerous patents in logistics, sensor fusion, and supply chain security, as well as several prestigious industry awards, including NASA’s Innovator of the Year and Advertising Age/Business Marketing’s Top 10 Marketer. 





About AEye
AEye develops advanced vision hardware, software and algorithms that act as the eyes and visual cortex of autonomous vehicles. Since the demonstration of its first solid state LiDAR scanner in 2013, AEye has pioneered breakthroughs in intelligent sensing and perception technology.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
