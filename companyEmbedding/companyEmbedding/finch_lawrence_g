Managing Director


Biography
Larry joined Sigma in 1987.  He is a true pioneer of the high technology industry and has combined, over 40 years experience in founding, managing and financing businesses.  Throughout his career, Finch has served in roles as technologist, world-wide sales and marketing executive, and general manager of businesses units.  He tracks a wide range of technologies, but tends to specialize in semiconductors, fabless semiconductors, and business software.
Background
Most recently, he was President and CEO of Paradise Systems, Inc. When he joined Paradise in 1984, it was a troubled venture capital financed start-up company with annual revenues of $4 million. In two and one-half years, he established the company as the worldwide premier supplier of IBM-compatible personal computer video controllers. He then sold the company in 1986 to Western Digital Corp. for $70 million in stock. Prior to Paradise, he was the founder, President and CEO of Shasta General Systems, Inc., a seller of small business computer systems, which he grew to $20 million in revenues and then sold to Zentec Corp. in 1983. Before founding Shasta, he held senior management positions with Singer Business Machines and Friden, Inc.
