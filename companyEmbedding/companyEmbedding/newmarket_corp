NewMarket Corporation (NYSE:NEU) , Platform Specialty Products Corporation (NYSE:PAH) , NEU,  PAH, compare










NewMarket Corporation versus Platform Specialty Products Corporation Head to Head Compare
				Date Published:
					
						2017-05-11
					
This is a head to head compare of NewMarket Corporation (NYSE:NEU)  and Platform Specialty Products Corporation (NYSE:PAH) . We will compare the two companies on revenue growth, earnings, revenue per employee, operating margins, free cash flow and valuation. The head to head compare assigns 100 points in total. 
				


				Before we dive into the analysis, we will look at the stock returns for each company over the last three months, six months and the last year. The stock returns do not impact the head to head compare scores which are focused on the fundamentals of each company, but ultimately stock returns are are still a critical piece to a full analysis and compare.





Stock Returns



Symbol
3-Months
6-Months
One-Year
Fundamentals


NEU
+6.0%
+11.1%
+13.0%



PAH
+4.8%
+57.6%
+30.8%








 Platform Specialty Products Corporation has a higher fundamental rating then NewMarket Corporation which has an impact on the head-to-head comparison. The CML Star Rating is an objective, quantifiable measure of a company's operating and financial condition. 
		The rating is computed by measuring numerous elements of the company's current financial data and their associated changes over time.
		
		Now, let's dive into the two companies to compare them.






➤ Income Statement
First we turn to the income statement and compare revenue, earnings and revenue per employee for both companies. We note that simple revenue comparisons 
								do not impact the rating.
								
↪ Platform Specialty Products Corporation has larger revenue in the last year than NewMarket Corporation. 
						Raw revenue comps do not affect the head to head rating.Revenue↪ NEU is showing a profit while PAH has negative earnings over the last year.Net Income↪ NEU generates massively larger revenue per employee ($1.0 million) than PAH ($310,000).Revenue per Employee
			 ($ Millions)




➤ Margins
Next we create some derived metrics to compare the the amount of revenue earned per dollar of expense and the amount of free cash flow earned per dollar of revenue. Margins are one of the fairest ways to compare companies since they remove some of the bias of large versus small numbers.
								
↪ NewMarket Corporation generates $1.16 in revenue for every $1 of expense, very similar to Platform Specialty Products Corporation's $1.11.Revenue per Dollar of Expense↪ NEU generates $0.09 in levered free cash flow for every $1 of revenue, 
					massively higher than PAH's $0.02.Free Cash Flow
		per Dollar of Revenue




➤ Growth
Finally we compare the financial metrics related to growth: revenue growth rates and price to sales.
								
↪ While Platform Specialty Products Corporation is growing revenue, NewMarket Corporation revenue is actually shrinking. Platform Specialty Products Corporation revenue is growing faster than 50%.Revenue Growth↪  For every $1 in revenue, the stock market prices in $2.56 in market cap for NEU and $1.10 in market cap for PAH.Price to Sales



NewMarket Corporation (NYSE:NEU)  defeats Platform Specialty Products Corporation (NYSE:PAH) : 51 to 49

Businesses[edit]
NewMarket Corporation produces lubricant and fuel additives through two subsidiaries: Afton Chemical Corporation and Ethyl Corporation. Two additional subsidiaries, NewMarket Services Corporation and NewMarket Development Corporation, primarily provide operational support.[5]
Afton Chemical Corporation
Afton Chemical Corporation produces fuel additives that boost fuel performance and lubricant additives that improve the functionality, durability and performance of oils.[6] The company also produces driveline additives and a variety of industrial additives, such as hydraulic lubricants and metalworking fluid components.[7]
Afton Chemical has manufacturing locations throughout the United States, as well as in Belgium, England, India, China and Brazil.[8] A new chemical additive manufacturing plant is being constructed in Jurong Island, Singapore, and is expected to become operational late-2015.[9] The company also has regional offices in North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe, India and the Middle East [10] and an R&D technical center for vehicle-based research in Ashland, Virginia.[11]
Robert Shama is the president of Afton Chemical.[12]
Ethyl Corporation
Ethyl provides contract manufacturing services to Afton and to third parties and is a marketer of TEL in North America.[13] The company was founded in 1924 after Charles Kettering and a team of scientists discovered an anti-knocking agent for vehicle engines in 1921.[14] Ethyl Corporation is based in Richmond, Virginia, and has a manufacturing plant in Houston, Texas.[15] Azfar Choudhury is the president of Ethyl Corporation.[16]
NewMarket Services Corporation
NewMarket Services Corporation provides administrative services to NewMarket Corporation and its subsidiaries.[17]
NewMarket Development Corporation
New Market Development Corporation manages the approximately 57-acre property that NewMarket Corporation owns in Richmond, Virginia.[18]
History[edit]
NewMarket Corporation was founded in 1887 as the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company.[19] In 1964, Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company acquired Ethyl Corporation,[20] a company started in 1924 by Charles Kettering following the development of an anti-knocking agent for passenger vehicles.[21]
Ethyl Corporation acquired Edwin Cooper, Inc., a supplier of oil and lubricant additives, in 1975.[22] The acquisitions continued with U.S.-based Amoco Petroleum Additives [23] and Japan-based Nippon Cooper in 1992,[24] and Texaco Additives Company in 1996.[25]
NewMarket Corporation was incorporated in 2004 and renamed its Ethyl Petroleum Additives, Inc. subsidiary as Afton Chemical Corporation.[26] Afton acquired GE Water & Process Technologies’ fuel additives business in 2008 [27] and acquired metalworking additives producer Polartech in 2010.[28]

Businesses[edit]
NewMarket Corporation produces lubricant and fuel additives through two subsidiaries: Afton Chemical Corporation and Ethyl Corporation. Two additional subsidiaries, NewMarket Services Corporation and NewMarket Development Corporation, primarily provide operational support.[5]
Afton Chemical Corporation
Afton Chemical Corporation produces fuel additives that boost fuel performance and lubricant additives that improve the functionality, durability and performance of oils.[6] The company also produces driveline additives and a variety of industrial additives, such as hydraulic lubricants and metalworking fluid components.[7]
Afton Chemical has manufacturing locations throughout the United States, as well as in Belgium, England, India, China and Brazil.[8] A new chemical additive manufacturing plant is being constructed in Jurong Island, Singapore, and is expected to become operational late-2015.[9] The company also has regional offices in North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe, India and the Middle East [10] and an R&D technical center for vehicle-based research in Ashland, Virginia.[11]
Robert Shama is the president of Afton Chemical.[12]
Ethyl Corporation
Ethyl provides contract manufacturing services to Afton and to third parties and is a marketer of TEL in North America.[13] The company was founded in 1924 after Charles Kettering and a team of scientists discovered an anti-knocking agent for vehicle engines in 1921.[14] Ethyl Corporation is based in Richmond, Virginia, and has a manufacturing plant in Houston, Texas.[15] Azfar Choudhury is the president of Ethyl Corporation.[16]
NewMarket Services Corporation
NewMarket Services Corporation provides administrative services to NewMarket Corporation and its subsidiaries.[17]
NewMarket Development Corporation

History[edit]
NewMarket Corporation was founded in 1887 as the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company.[19] In 1964, Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company acquired Ethyl Corporation,[20] a company started in 1924 by Charles Kettering following the development of an anti-knocking agent for passenger vehicles.[21]
Ethyl Corporation acquired Edwin Cooper, Inc., a supplier of oil and lubricant additives, in 1975.[22] The acquisitions continued with U.S.-based Amoco Petroleum Additives [23] and Japan-based Nippon Cooper in 1992,[24] and Texaco Additives Company in 1996.[25]
NewMarket Corporation was incorporated in 2004 and renamed its Ethyl Petroleum Additives, Inc. subsidiary as Afton Chemical Corporation.[26] Afton acquired GE Water & Process Technologies’ fuel additives business in 2008 [27] and acquired metalworking additives producer Polartech in 2010.[28]
