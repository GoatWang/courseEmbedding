 Educational Background



 


Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Sloan School of Management

                  MIT Sloan School of Management is the business school of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. MIT Sloan offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral programs, as well as non-degree executive education. Its largest program is its full-time MBA, which is one of the most selective in the world, with students from more than 60 countries every year, and ranked #1 in more subjects than any other MBA program.                




 


Purdue University

                  Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly, taking advantage of the Morrill Act, accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.

The university was founded with the gift of $150,000 from John Purdue, a Lafayette business leader and philanthropist, along with $50,000 from Tippecanoe County, and 150 acres (0.6 km²) of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project. In 1869, it was decided that the new school would be built near the city of Lafayette and established as Purdue University, in the name of the institution’s principal benefactor.

The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 master’s and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 850 student organizations. Today, Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States.

INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 12, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:   CLMT) ("Calumet" or the "Partnership") today announced that Daniel J. Sajkowski and Amy M. Schumacher have been elected as directors of Calumet GP, LLC, the general partner of the Partnership, effective September 12, 2014.  Mr. Sajkowski and Ms. Schumacher replace Nicholas J. Rutigliano and William S. Fehsenfeld, each of whom gave notice to the Board on September 12, 2014 of their intent to step down as directors effective September 12, 2014.
"We are deeply appreciative of Nick and Bill's many years of loyal service to the Partnership beginning with our initial public offering in 2006," stated Fred M. Fehsenfeld, Jr., Chairman of the Board for Calumet GP, LLC.  "Under their leadership and counsel, our Partnership has achieved considerable growth and profitability.  We wish them well in their retirements."

During his career with BP/Amoco, he also held positions as the Manager of Integrated Supply and Trading and Vice President of Refining Technology worldwide with facilities in Sunbury, England and outside of Chicago. During his career, Sajkowski has held numerous other management positions in refinery operations and research and development.  He earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Chemical Engineering from the University of Michigan and a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Stanford University in 1986. He also completed The General Manager Program at Harvard University in 2000.
Ms. Schumacher, 43, has been the President of Monument Chemicals, Inc. and Haltermann Solutions since 2008, where she guides the strategic growth of each business.  Prior to joining Monument Chemicals, Schumacher worked for The Heritage Group leading a variety of growth projects and, prior to this assignment, was employed as a consultant with Accenture.  Schumacher received her B.S. in Civil Engineering from Purdue University and her M.S. in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School.  She currently serves as a Trustee for The Heritage Group and sits on a number of private subsidiary boards.
"We are pleased to welcome Dan and Amy to our Board of Directors," continued Fehsenfeld.  "Dan brings deep technical knowledge and extensive refining industry expertise to our Board, while Amy adds valuable perspective as a seasoned, senior-level executive within the chemicals industry.  We believe these new Board elections serve to further strengthen Calumet in our pursuit to become a leading global specialty products company."

Historical, unprecedented, and unmatched is what F. Schumacher & Co. is in the world of home décor. How else would you describe a company that had helped decorate the White House, the Chambers of the United States Supreme Court, The Metropolitan Opera and numerous acclaimed residential homes including the Hearst Private Residences? In addition, Schumacher has collaborated with some of the most respected and well-known designers of the 20th century. Their names read like a Mount Rushmore of Décor and design: Paul Poiret, Dorothy Draper, Cecil Beaton and Frank Lloyd Wright. Today, that tradition of working with only the best continues with their relationships with some of the top designers of our time, including Alessandra Branca, Trina Turk and Timothy Corrigan. Collaborations with innovative designers assure the client that Schumacher’s decorative fabrics, wallcoverings, trimmings, and furnishings will always strike a balance between classic elegance and modern sophistication.
The Schumacher collection captures all the look and style of traditional and contemporary designs. Their fabrics are available in an array of textiles, patterns, and prints. The Queen of Spain line is just as bold today, as it was when it was first released in 1963; a repeated leaf pattern on 100% cotton, a striking look available in five bold hues. Serengeti is an eye-catching animal print that is created by a heady mix of texture and color.  Gold Rush is woven with glittering metallic finishes that shimmer and shine with reckless abandon. These fabric lines, as well as countless others, assure Schumacher that they will continue to be the fabric of choice for countless generations. Since 1889, Schumacher has created a collection of luxury home designs that have set the standard for all others to follow. Still privately owned, and operated by the same family for over a century. Today, the Schumacher standard of high-end quality is found in countless trade showrooms across the Americas, in Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa.
