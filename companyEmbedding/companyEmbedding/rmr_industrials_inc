	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS


	 


	The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
	that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements." Forward-looking statements may include our statements
	regarding our goals, beliefs, strategies, objectives, plan, including product and service developments, future financial conditions,
	results or projections or current expectations. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use
	of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "estimates," "intends," "plan" "expects,"
	"may," "will," "should," "predicts," "anticipates," "continues," or
	"potential," or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, and similar expressions are
	intended to identify forward-looking statements. We remind readers that forward-looking statements are merely predictions and therefore
	inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors and involve known and unknown risks that could cause the actual results,
	performance, levels of activity, or our achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results,
	performance, levels of activity, or our achievements, or industry results, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
	Such forward-looking statements appear in Item 2 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
	of Operations," as well as elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.


	 


	Our management has included projections and estimates in this
	Form 10-Q, which are based primarily on management’s experience in the industry, assessments of our results of operations,
	discussions and negotiations with third parties and a review of information filed by our competitors with the SEC or otherwise
	publicly available.  We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak
	only as of the date made.  We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect
	events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.


	 


	Unless otherwise specified or required by context, as used in
	this Quarterly Report, the terms "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" refer collectively
	to RMR Industrials, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, RMR IP, Inc., United States Talc and Minerals Inc., and RMR Aggregates,
	Inc. The term "fiscal year" refers to our fiscal year ending March 31. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "common
	stock" refers to shares of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.


	 


	Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars
	(US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).

	RMR INDUSTRIALS, INC.






	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	June 30, 2016


	 


	NOTE A – FORMATION, CORPORATE CHANGES AND MATERIAL
	MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS


	 


	Online Yearbook was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August
	6, 2012. Online Yearbook was a development stage company with the principal business objective of developing and marketing an online
	yearbook.


	 


	On November 17, 2014, Rocky Mountain Resource Holdings LLC,
	a Nevada limited liability company (the “Purchaser”) became the majority shareholder of Online Yearbook, by acquiring
	5,200,000 shares of common stock of Online Yearbook (the “Shares”), or 69.06% of the issued and outstanding shares
	of common stock, pursuant to stock purchase agreements with Messrs. El Maraana and Salah Blal. The Shares were acquired for an
	aggregate purchase price of $357,670. The Purchaser was the source of the funds used to acquire the Shares. In connection with
	Online Yearbook’s receipt of approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), effective December
	8, 2014, Online Yearbook amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from “Online Yearbook” to “RMR
	Industrials, Inc.”


	 


	RMR Industrials, Inc. (the “Company” or “RMRI”)
	seeks to acquire and consolidate complimentary industrial assets. Typically these small to mid-sized assets are the core manufacturer
	and supplier of specific bulk commodity minerals and chemicals distributed to the global manufacturer industry. RMRI’s consolidation
	strategy is to assemble a portfolio of mature and value-add industrial commodities businesses to generate scalable enterprises
	with a vast portfolio of products and services addressing a common and stable customer base.


	 


	On February 27, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), the Company
	entered into and consummated a merger transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)
	by and among the Company, OLYB Acquisition Corporation, a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger
	Sub”) and RMR IP, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“RMR IP”). In accordance with the terms of Merger Agreement, on
	the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into RMR IP (the “Merger”), with RMR IP surviving the Merger as our wholly
	owned subsidiary.


	 


	RMR IP was formed to acquire and consolidate complimentary industrial
	commodity assets through capitalizing on the volatile oil markets, down cycles in commodity markets, and other ancillary opportunities.
	RMR IP is focused on managing the supply chain in order to offer a large and diverse set of products and services.


	 


	The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties
	and covenants made by the Company, Merger Sub and RMR IP as of specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations
	and warranties were made solely for purposes of the Merger Agreement and are not intended to provide factual, business, or financial
	information about the Company, Merger Sub and RMR IP. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties (i) may not be accurate
	or complete as of any specified date, (ii) may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally
	applicable to shareholders or different from what a shareholder might view as material, (iii) may have been used for purposes of
	allocating risk among the Company, Merger Sub and RMR IP, rather than establishing matters as facts, and/or (iv) may have been
	qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the Merger Agreement that were made to the other party in connection with the
	negotiation of the Merger Agreement and generally were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement.


	 


	For financial reporting purposes, the Merger represents a “reverse
	merger” rather than a business combination and RMR IP is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction. Consequently,
	the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the Company’s future financial statements
	will be those of RMR IP. The Company’s assets, liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with the assets,
	liabilities and results of operations of RMR IP after consummation of the Merger, and the historical financial statements of the
	Company before the Merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of RMR IP before the Merger in all future filings
	with the SEC.


	 


	On March 10, 2015, we formed United States Talc and Minerals
	Inc. (“US Talc and Minerals”), incorporated in the State of Nevada as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company for
	the purpose of facilitating future acquisitions.

	Basis of Presentation and Consolidation



	 


	The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
	for the period ended June 30, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States for interim financial information in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X rule 8-03.
	The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the financial condition and results of operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary,
	US Talc and Minerals, where intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management,
	the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect
	all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position as of June
	30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended. The financial data and other information disclosed
	in these notes to the interim consolidated financial statements related to the period are unaudited.


	  


	NOTE B – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES


	 


	A summary of significant accounting policies of the Company
	is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies presented
	in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and
	have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial
	statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.


	 



	Consolidation




	 



	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The unaudited consolidated
	financial statements include the financial condition and results of operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, US Talc and Minerals,
	where intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.



	 




	Use of Estimates




	 



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
	requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and
	expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
	could materially differ from those estimates. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies
	and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. Management
	must apply significant judgment in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including: expected business
	and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical
	trends are expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates
	of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that falls within that range of reasonable estimates. Although
	these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual
	results may ultimately materially differ from those estimated amounts and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial
	statements.


	 



	Segment Reporting




	 



	Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise
	about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making
	decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business as
	one operating segment.


	 






	F-

	5

	 





	 




	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 



	The Company considers all highly liquid securities with original
	maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had cash of
	$258,836 and no cash equivalents. The Company may occasionally maintain cash balances in excess of amounts insured by the Federal
	Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The amounts are held with major financial institutions and are monitored by
	management to mitigate credit risk.


	 



	Deposits




	 



	Deposits consist of a security deposit in connection with an
	office lease.



	 




	Other Assets




	 



	Other assets consist of a deposit towards the acquisition of
	certain intellectual property rights.


	 



	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	 


	The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever
	events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered include:


	 




	 



	•




	Significant changes in the operational performance or manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business,





	 




	 



	•




	Significant negative market conditions or economic trends, and





	 




	 



	•




	Significant technological changes or legal factors which may render the asset obsolete.





	 


	The Company evaluated long-lived assets based upon an estimate
	of future undiscounted cash flows. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying value to the future net
	undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value exceeds
	the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Future net undiscounted
	cash flows include estimates of future revenues and expenses which are based on projected growth rates. The Company continually
	uses judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests, the undiscounted cash flows
	used to assess impairments and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset.



	  




	Fair Value Measurements




	 



	The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that
	could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
	at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair
	value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability
	of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level
	of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories:


	 


	- Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical
	assets or liabilities


	- Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or inputs that are
	corroborated by market data


	- Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by
	market data


	  



	Net Loss per Common Share




	 



	Basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the
	net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without
	consideration for the potentially dilutive effects of converting stock options or restricted stock purchase rights outstanding.
	Diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average
	number of common shares outstanding during the period and the potential dilutive effects of stock options or restricted stock purchase
	rights outstanding during the period determined using the treasury stock method. There are no such anti-dilutive common share equivalents
	outstanding as June 30, 2016 which were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per common share.


	 






	F-

	6

	 





	 




	 



	Income Taxes




	 



	The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability
	method, which requires, among other things, that deferred income taxes be provided for temporary differences between the tax bases
	of the Company's assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts. Under this method, deferred tax assets
	and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities
	using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax
	rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	A valuation allowance is recorded by the Company when it is
	more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, management
	considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected
	future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance.
	When the Company establishes or reduces the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, its provision for income taxes
	will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.


	 


	Additionally, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an
	uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
	authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for a particular
	tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Accordingly, the Company
	establishes reserves for uncertain tax positions. The Company has not recognized interest or penalties in its statement of operations
	and comprehensive loss since inception.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 



	The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued Accounting
	Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties
	about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments require management to assess an entity’s ability
	to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.
	Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting
	period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management’s plans, (4)
	require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans, (5)
	require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for
	a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this
	Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.


	 


	Management believes recently issued accounting
	pronouncements will have no impact on the financial statements of the Company.


	 


	NOTE C – GOING CONCERN


	 


	The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization
	of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have significant cash
	or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow
	it to continue as a going concern.


	 



	The Company’s net
	loss and working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
	the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements for the three months ended June 30,
	2016 do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of the recoverability and classification of assets or
	the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company’s ability to continue
	as a going concern. The Company may never become profitable, or if it does, it may not be able to sustain profitability on a recurring
	basis.



	 






	F-

	7

	 





	 




	 


	Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily
	viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing
	trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded
	on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.


	 


	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is
	dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the business plan and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	During the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements
	will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite
	filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with research and development. The
	Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.


	 


	Historically, it has mostly relied upon funds from the sale
	of shares of stock and from acquiring loans to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through
	future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be
	no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse
	effect upon it and its shareholders.


	 


	In the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash
	proceeds received through the issuance of common stock and proceeds from related party debt. For the coming year, the Company plans
	to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through
	the operations as stated above.


	 


	NOTE D – TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES


	 


	Since inception, the Company accrued $1,618,233 in amounts owed
	to related parties for services performed or reimbursement of costs on behalf of the Company. In addition, the Company has accrued
	$1,285,000 for unpaid officers’ compensation expense in accordance with consulting agreements with our Chief Executive Officer
	and President. Under the terms of each consulting agreement, each consultant shall serve as an executive officer to the Company
	and receive monthly compensation of $35,000. The consulting agreements may be terminated by either party for breach or upon thirty
	days prior written notice.


	 


	On February 1, 2015, RMR, IP entered into a management services
	agreement with Industrial Management LLC (“IM”), to provide services to RMR, IP and affiliated entities, which include
	assistance in operational and administrative matters, identifying, analyzing, and structuring growth initiatives, and potential
	strategic acquisitions. As compensation for these services, RMR, IP will pay to IM an annual cash management fee in an amount equal
	to the greater of 2% of the Company’s annual gross revenues or $1,000,000, and a development fee with respect to any capital
	project incurred by RMR IP equal to 2% of total project costs. In addition, IM has the option to be assigned all available royalties
	from RMR IP’s mineral holdings, leases or interests greater than 75% of net revenue interests for all mineral rights or production
	of minerals. At IM’s sole discretion, it may choose to accept a preferred convertible security with a 15% dividend accruing
	quarterly in lieu of cash for some or all of the annual management fee, development fee and royalty assignments. Such preferred
	convertible securities shall be convertible into either Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock (as applicable) at a conversion
	price equal to fifty percent of the market price of the applicable Class B Common Stock on the day prior to the date of issuance.
	In addition, these preferred convertible securities are callable for a cash, for a period of six months following the date of issuance;
	provided, however, that if called, IM shall have the option to convert the called preferred stock into either Class A Common Stock
	or Class B Common Stock (as applicable) at a conversion price equal to sixty-six and two thirds percent of the market price of
	the applicable Class B Common Stock on the business day immediately preceding the issuance date of preferred stock, and will include
	a blocker provision. In connection with the management services agreement with IM, RMR IP entered into a registration rights agreement
	which requires RMR IP to register for resale any securities issued as consideration under the management services agreement. The
	registration rights agreements provide for both demand and piggy back registration rights, and requires that IM not transfer any
	shares of RMR IP during a 90 day period following the effective date of a registration statement. The registration rights agreement
	terminates when the shares held by IM become eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144.


	 




	On June 15, 2016, Rocky Mountain Resource Holdings Inc., entered
	into a Standard Office Lease agreement (the “Lease Agreement”) for its principal headquarters located in Beverly Hills,
	California, with a commencement date of July 1, 2016. Although the Company is not a party to the Lease Agreement, the security
	deposit and monthly rent payments will be funded by the Company in exchange for use of office space. Future rent payments by the
	Company will be recorded as a period cost in its operating expenses.

	NOTE E – INTANGIBLE ASSETS


	 


	The Company obtained an Option Agreement (“Option Agreement”)
	from RMR Holdings, Inc. with the Colorado School of Mines (“CSM”), which grants the Company an exclusive nine month
	option period to obtain an exclusive license for any patent rights owned by CSM. On August 25, 2014, CSM entered into the Option
	Agreement with the Company for a non-refundable fee of $30,000. Since the Company was in the process of formation, RMR Holdings,
	Inc. countersigned the Option Agreement with CSM on behalf of the Company. On October 15, 2014, the Company was incorporated in
	Nevada (Note 1) and RMR Holdings, Inc. assigned the Option Agreement to the Company. RMR Holdings, Inc. recorded amortization expense
	of $5,625 through October 15, 2014, which represented the elapsed time of holding the option since it was executed. The Company
	owed RMR Holdings, Inc. $24,375 which represented the approximate carrying value of RMR Holdings, Inc. at October 15, 2014, for
	an exclusive period which was initially set to expire on May 25, 2015, to evaluate CSM’s existing patent rights, technology
	and market potential. The Option Agreement was amended to extend the evaluation period until September 1, 2016, in exchange for
	an advance payment of $2,500 creditable towards a licensing fee. The Company may extend the Option Agreement for two (2) three
	month periods in exchange for a $3,000 extension fee per each patent or patent application. The value of the Option Agreement has
	been fully amortized over the term of the exclusivity period. The advance payments towards a licensing fee was capitalized as a
	progress payment towards the purchase of an intangible asset.


	 


	NOTE F – SHAREHOLDERS’ DEFICIT


	 



	Reverse Stock Split



	 


	On September 4, 2015, the Company implemented a reverse
	stock split of all of its authorized and issued and outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock in ratio of one-for-twenty. All
	historical and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.



	 




	Preferred Stock



	 


	The Company has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock
	for issuance. At March 31, 2016, no preferred stock was issued and outstanding.


	 



	Common Stock



	 


	The Company has authorized 2,100,000,000 shares of common stock
	for issuance, including 2,000,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, 100,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. At June 30, 2016,
	the Company had 35,785,858 and 1,030,957 shares issued and outstanding of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, respectively.


	 


	The holders of Class A Common Stock will have the right to vote
	on all matters on which stockholders have the right to vote. The holders of Class B Common Stock will have the right to vote solely
	on matters where the vote of such holders is explicitly required under Nevada law.  The holders of Class A Common Stock and
	Class B Common stock will have equal distribution rights, provided that distributions in securities shall be made in either identical
	securities or securities with similar voting characteristics.  The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
	will be entitled to receive identical per-share consideration upon a merger, conversion or exchange of the Company with another
	entity, and will have equal rights upon dissolutions, liquidation or winding-up. 


	 


	On June 30, 2016 the Company entered into a
	subscription agreement with an accredited investor (the "Purchaser") to offer and sell 40,000 units of the
	Company’s securities (the “Units”) at $10.00 per Unit for which the Company received $299,897 in initial
	proceeds and $100,000 in common stock subscribed. Each Unit entitles the Purchaser to one share of Class B Common Stock of
	the Company and a warrant to purchase one share of Class B Common Stock at an exercise price of $10.00 with a term of two
	years. In the event the Company’s Class B Common Stock is not quoted or listed on a qualified national stock exchange
	by November 1, 2016, the Company will issue an additional warrant to purchase one share of Class B Common Stock at an
	exercise price of $10.00 with a term of two years.

	Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition And Results Of Operations



	 


	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
	our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Forward looking
	statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results
	or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates, forecasts, and assumptions that are inherently subject
	to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many
	of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual
	results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us,
	or on our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.



	 




	Overview



	 


	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 6, 2012
	under the name “Online Yearbook” with the principal business objective of developing and marketing online yearbooks
	for schools, companies and government agencies.


	 


	On November 17, 2014, Rocky Mountain Resource Holdings, Inc.
	(“RMRH”) became our majority shareholder by acquiring 5,200,000 shares of our common stock (the “Shares”),
	or 69.06% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, pursuant to stock purchase agreements with Messrs. El Maraana
	and Salah Blal, our former officers and directors. The Shares were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $357,670.


	 


	On December 8, 2014, we changed our name to “RMR Industrials,
	Inc.” in connection with the change in our business plan.


	 


	On February 27, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), we entered
	into and consummated a merger transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and
	among the Company, OLYB Acquisition Corporation, a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger
	Sub”) and RMR IP, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“RMR IP”). In accordance with the terms of Merger Agreement, on
	the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into RMR IP (the “Merger”), with RMR IP surviving the Merger as our wholly
	owned subsidiary. Chad Brownstein and Gregory M. Dangler are the directors of the Company and co-owners of RMRH which was the majority
	shareholder of the Company prior to the Merger. Additionally, Chad Brownstein and Gregory Dangler were indirect controlling shareholders
	and directors of RMR IP prior to the Merger. As such, the Merger was among entities under the common control of Chad Brownstein
	and Gregory Dangler.


	 


	On May 11, 2016, our Board of Directors changed our fiscal year
	end from September 30 to March 31.


	 


	On July 28, 2016, we formed RMR Aggregates, Inc., a Colorado
	corporation (“RMR Aggregates”), as our wholly owned subsidiary. RMR Aggregates was formed to hold assets whose primary
	focus is the mining and processing of industrial minerals for the manufacturing, construction and agriculture sectors.  These
	minerals include limestone, aggregates, marble, silica, barite and sand.


	 


	We have acquired the rights to certain intellectual property
	from the Colorado School of Mines (“CSM”), including issued US patent 7,662,275 and US patent applications 61/946062,
	61/941869 and 61/950500 through payment of an advance deposit in accordance with our option agreement with CSM in July 2015. We
	currently have the right to market and pursue licensing opportunities with these patents. We will obtain full title and ownership
	to the patent rights once we have paid the remaining balance under the option agreement, which terminates on September 1, 2016.
	Our negotiations on the valuation of these patent rights are currently ongoing. These patents describe a process to increase oil
	and gas production through modified injection processes. Our management views CSM as a highly respected institution which specializes
	in industrial minerals technology research and believes that CSM could be a valuable technical resource for future intellectual
	property development. 


	  


	We plan to develop intellectual property and acquire and consolidate
	complementary industrial assets.  Typically these small to mid-sized assets are the core manufacturer and supplier of specific
	bulk commodity minerals and chemicals distributed to the global manufacturer industry. Our consolidation strategy is to assemble
	a portfolio of mature and value-add industrial commodities businesses to generate scalable enterprises with a large portfolio of
	products and services addressing a common and stable customer base. We believe that smaller, legacy-owned industrial companies
	will benefit from economies of scale and professional asset allocation. Our acquisition strategy seeks to capitalize on the price
	differential between public company and private company valuations, while also providing the platform to access capital markets
	and professional management oversight.

	Results of Operations




	 






	Comparison of the Three Month Periods Ended June 30,
	2016 and June 30, 2015






	 





	Revenues




	 


	We have a limited operational history. We did not generate any
	revenues in either period.



	 





	Operating Expenses 




	 


	Our operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016
	were $773,825, compared to $537,248 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Operating expenses consisted of consulting services
	from related parties, public company costs, personnel and other administrative expenses. The increase in our operating expenses
	was due to higher spending in consulting, personnel costs and legal fees related to sourcing and development of mergers and acquisition-related
	activities.


	  



	Net Loss



	 


	Our net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $773,985,
	compared to a net loss of $537,248 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in our net loss was due to an increase
	in our operating expense, as described above.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As of June 30, 2016, we had current assets of $268,907, total
	current liabilities of $3,395,794 and working capital deficit of $3,126,887. We have incurred an accumulated loss of $4,792,545
	since inception. Our independent auditors issued an audit opinion for our financial statements for the six month transition period
	ended March 31, 2016, which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern
	due to our limited liquidity and our lack of revenues.


	 


	We will be seeking additional capital to execute our business
	plan and reach positive cash flow from operations. Our base monthly expenses are $50,000 per month. In order to successfully execute
	our business plan, the net proceeds of a $10-20 million offering will be required to finance our planned acquisitions and for general
	working capital purposes.


	 


	We do not internally generate adequate cash flows to support
	our existing operations. Moreover, the historical and existing capital structure is not adequate to fund our planned growth. Our
	current cash requirements are significant due to our business plan which will depend on future acquisitions. We anticipate generating
	losses through 2016. We anticipate that we will be able to raise sufficient amounts of working capital in the near term through
	debt or equity offerings as may be required to meet short-term obligations. On July 1, 2015, we filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission a registration statement for a public offering of 700,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. Each unit is
	comprised of one share of our Class B Common Stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our Class B Common Stock at an initial
	exercise price of $12.50. In November 2015, we sold 147,500 units to several accredited investors for $1,475,000 in proceeds under
	this offering. 


	 


	On March 28, 2016, we issued 10,000 shares of our Class B common
	stock valued at $100,000 in accordance with a Loan Settlement Agreement and Release for repayment of $100,000 of outstanding liabilities
	owed to an affiliate of the Company.


	 







	6

	 





	 




	 


	On June 30, 2016, we sold 40,000 units to an accredited
	investor for which we received $299,897 in initial proceeds and $100,000 in common stock subscribed. Each unit is comprised
	of one share of our Class B Common Stock and a warrant exercisable to purchase one share of our Class B Common Stock at an
	exercise price of $10.00 per share, exercisable over a two (2) year period. In the event our Class B
	Common Stock is not quoted or listed on a qualified national stock exchange by November 1, 2016, we will issue an
	additional warrant to purchase one share of Class B Common Stock at an exercise price of $10.00 with a term of two years.


	 


	Other than as stated above, we currently do not have any arrangements
	for additional financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to
	obtain financing, a successful marketing and promotion program and, further in the future, achieving a profitable level of operations.
	Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.   We
	will require additional funds to maintain our reporting status with the SEC and remain in good standing with the state of Nevada.
	There are no assurances that we will be able to raise the required working capital on terms favorable, or that such working capital
	will be available on any terms when needed. Any failure to secure additional financing may force us to modify our business plan.
	In addition, we cannot be assured of profitability in the future.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	We have incurred net losses since our inception on October 15,
	2014 through June 30, 2016 totaling $4,792,545 and have completed the preliminary stages of our business plan.  We anticipate
	incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing
	obligations and ultimately, to attain profitability.  Our ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the
	issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is uncertain.  Accordingly, our independent auditors’
	report on our financial statements for the transition period ended March 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns
	about our ability to continue as a going concern, including additional information contained in the notes to our financial statements
	describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
	might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.


	 



	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	We do not expect the adoption of any recently
	issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.



	 







	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
	About Market Risk



	 


	Not Required




	 








	Item 4. Controls and Procedures



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted
	an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our
	disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation,
	our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
	ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded,
	processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated
	and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar
	functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	There were no changes in our internal control over financial
	reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016
	that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Item 2.	Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
	and Use of Proceeds




	 



	On June 30, 2016, we entered into a Subscription
	Agreement with an accredited investor (the “Purchaser”) to offer and sell 40,000 units of the Company’s securities
	at $10.00 per unit for aggregate proceeds of $400,000. Each unit entitles the Purchaser to one share of the Company’s Class
	B Common Stock, and a warrant to purchase one share of Class B Common Stock at an exercise price of $10.00 with a term of two (2)
	years (the “Warrant”). We intend to use the proceeds from the sale for general working capital purposes and acquisitions.
	This sale was to an “accredited investor,” as defined by Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities
	Act. The sale was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to the exemption for transactions by
	an issuer not involved in any public offering under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D.


	 


	The foregoing description of the Subscription Agreement and
	the Warrant does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Subscription
	Agreement and form of Warrant, which are filed as Exhibit 10.1 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

	SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT



	 


	THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT
	(this “

	Agreement

	”) is by and between the undersigned Subscriber identified on the signature page attached hereto
	(the “

	” and collectively with the Shares and the Warrants, referred to herein as the “

	Securities

	”)
	at an exercise price of $10.00 per share, exercisable over a two (2) year period and in accordance with the terms set forth in
	the Warrants.


	 



	Section 1.5

	of the Subscriber

	. The Subscriber hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:


	 



	Section 2.1

	.	

	Power
	and Authority

	. The Subscriber has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement, the execution and delivery of which
	has been duly authorized, if applicable, and this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Subscriber.
	The Subscriber is either an individual or an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
	jurisdiction of its organization with full right, corporate or partnership power and authority to enter into and to consummate
	the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to carry out its obligations hereunder.


	 





	 




	 




	 



	Section 2.2

	.	

	Exempt
	Sale

	. The Subscriber acknowledges that the sale of the Securities is intended to be exempt from registration under the Securities
	Act of 1933, as amended (the “

	Securities Act

	”), by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and the provisions
	of Regulation D promulgated thereunder (“

	Regulation D

	”).


	 



	Section 2.3

	.	

	Acquisition
	for Own Account

	. The Subscriber is acquiring the Securities solely for the Subscriber’s own beneficial account, for investment
	purposes, and not with a view towards, or resale in connection with, any distribution of the Securities (this representation and
	warranty shall in no way limit Subscriber’s right to sell the Securities in compliance with applicable federal and state
	securities laws).


	 



	Section 2.4

	.	

	Financial
	Condition

	. The Subscriber’s financial condition is such that the Subscriber is able to bear the risk of holding the Securities
	for an indefinite period of time, the Subscriber has adequate means to provide for the Subscriber’s current financial needs
	and contingencies, the Subscriber has no need for liquidity in this investment and the Subscriber is able to risk the loss of the
	Subscriber’s entire investment in the Securities. The Subscriber’s overall commitment to investments that are not readily
	marketable such as an investment in the Securities is not disproportionate to the Subscriber’s net worth and the Subscriber’s
	investment in the Securities will not cause such overall commitments to become excessive.


	 



	Section 2.5

	.	

	Sophistication

	.
	The Subscriber and the Subscriber’s attorney, accountant, purchaser representative and/or tax advisor, if any (collectively,
	the “

	Advisors

	”) have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating
	the merits and risks of a prospective investment in the Securities. The Subscriber, either alone or together with its Advisors,
	has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
	and risks of the purchase of the Securities, and has so evaluated the merits and risks of such investment. The Subscriber has not
	authorized any Person to act as its “purchaser representative” (as that term is defined in Regulation D) in connection
	with purchase of the Securities.


	 



	Section 2.6

	.	

	Review
	of Information

	. The Subscriber acknowledges that it has had access to the documents filed by the Company with the Securities
	and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and has carefully reviewed the same. The Subscriber
	has been furnished by the Company during the course of this transaction with all information regarding the Company and the Securities
	which the Subscriber has requested or desires to know; and the Subscriber and its Advisors, if any, have been afforded the opportunity
	to ask questions of and receive answers from duly authorized officers or other representatives of the Company concerning the purchase
	of the Securities, the business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects of the Company, and any additional information
	which the Subscriber has requested, and all such questions have been answered to the full satisfaction of the Subscriber and its
	Advisors, if any.


	 



	Section 2.7

	.	

	Evaluation
	of Risks

	. The Subscriber has carefully considered the potential risks relating to the Company and a purchase of the Securities,
	including but not limited to a thorough review of the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s public filings
	with the Securities Exchange Commission, and fully understands that the Securities are a speculative investment that involve a
	high degree of risk of loss of the Subscriber’s entire investment.


	 



	Section 2.8

	.	

	No
	Oral Representations

	. The Subscriber confirms that no oral or written representations or warranties have been made to the Subscriber
	by the Company or any of its officers, employees, agents, sub-agents, affiliates or advisors, other than any representations of
	the Company contained herein, and in subscribing for the Securities, the Subscriber is not relying upon any representations other
	than those contained herein.

	Section 2.9

	.	

	No
	Reliance

	. The Subscriber is not relying on the Company or any of its employees, agents, sub-agents or advisors with respect
	to the legal, tax, economic and related considerations involved in this investment. The Subscriber has relied on the advice of,
	or has consulted with, only the Subscriber’s Advisors. Each Advisor, if any, is capable of evaluating the merits and risks
	of an investment in the Securities.


	 



	Section 2.10

	.	

	Accredited
	Investor

	. The Subscriber has accurately completed the Confidential Subscriber Questionnaire attached hereto and is an “accredited
	investor” as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D.


	 



	Section 2.11

	.	

	Restrictions
	on Transfer

	. The Subscriber will not sell or otherwise transfer any Securities without registration under the Securities Act
	or an exemption therefrom, and fully understands and agrees that the Subscriber must bear the economic risk of Subscriber’s
	purchase because, among other reasons, the Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or under the securities
	laws of any state and, therefore, cannot be resold, pledged, assigned or otherwise disposed of unless they are subsequently registered
	under the Securities Act and under the applicable securities laws of such states, or an exemption from such registration is available.
	In particular, the Subscriber is aware that the Securities are “restricted securities,” as such term is defined in
	Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (as such rule may be amended or superseded by a similar rule or regulation having
	substantially the same effect, “

	Rule 144

	”), and they may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 unless all of the
	conditions of Rule 144 are met. The Subscriber also understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Securities
	on behalf of the Subscriber or to assist the Subscriber in complying with any exemption from registration under the Securities
	Act or applicable state securities laws. The Subscriber understands that any sales or transfers of the Securities are further restricted
	by state securities laws and the provisions of this Agreement.


	 



	Section 2.12

	.	

	Restrictive
	Legends

	. The Subscriber understands and agrees that the certificates for the Securities shall bear substantially the following
	legend until (i) such Securities shall have been registered under the Securities Act and effectively disposed of in accordance
	with a registration statement that has been declared effective or (ii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company,
	such Securities may be sold without registration under the Securities Act, as well as any applicable “blue sky” or
	state securities laws:


	 


	THE SECURITIES
	REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”),
	OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND NEITHER SUCH SECURITIES NOR ANY INTEREST THEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED, ASSIGNED OR OTHERWISE
	TRANSFERRED UNLESS (1) A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH RESPECT THERETO IS EFFECTIVE UNDER THE ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
	LAWS, OR (2) HOLDER CAN ESTABLISH TO THE REASONABLE SATISFACTION OF THE COMPANY (WHICH MAY INCLUDE RECEIPT OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
	FROM THE HOLDER OF SUCH SECURITIES) THAT AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION EXISTS AND THAT SUCH SECURITIES MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD,
	PLEDGED, ASSIGNED OR TRANSFERRED IN THE MANNER CONTEMPLATED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT OR APPLICABLE
	STATE SECURITIES LAWS.


	 



	Section 2.13

	.	

	Address

	.
	The Subscriber hereby represents that the address of the Subscriber furnished at the end of this Agreement is the undersigned’s
	principal residence, if the Subscriber is an individual, or its principal business address if it is a corporation or other entity.


	 



	Section 2.14

	.	

	Prohibited
	Party to Transaction

	. Neither Subscriber nor any Person who owns an interest in Subscriber (a “

	Purchaser Party

	”)
	is now, or shall be at any time prior to or at the date of closing of the sale of the Securities hereunder, a Person with whom
	a United States citizen, entity organized under the laws of the United States or its territories or entity having its principal
	place of business within the United States or any of its territories, or a United States Financial Institution as defined in 31
	U.S.C. Section 5312, as amended, is prohibited from transacting business of the type contemplated by this Agreement, whether such
	prohibition arises under United States law, regulation, or executive orders and lists published by the Office of Foreign Assets
	Control, Department of the Treasury (“

	OFAC

	Payment

	. Subscriber has taken, and shall continue to take until the closing of the sale, such measures as are required
	by law to assure that the funds used to pay to the purchase price for the Securities are derived: (i) from transactions that do
	not violate United States law nor, to the extent such funds originate outside the United States, do not violate the laws of the
	jurisdiction in which they originated; and (ii) from permissible sources under United States law and to the extent such funds originate
	outside the United States, under the laws of the jurisdiction in which they originated.


	 



	Section 2.16

	Money
	Laundering

	funds to Subscriber: (i) is under investigation by any governmental authority for, or has been charged with, or convicted of, money
	laundering, drug trafficking, terrorist related activities, any crimes which in the United States would be predicate crimes to
	money laundering, or any violation of any Anti-Money Laundering Laws (as defined below); (ii) has been assessed civil or criminal
	penalties under any Anti-Money Laundering Laws; or (iii) has had any of its funds seized or forfeited in any action under any Anti-Money
	Laundering Laws. For purposes of this

	Section 2.16

	, the term “

	Anti-Money Laundering Laws

	” shall mean
	laws, regulations and sanctions, state and federal, criminal and civil, that: (i) limit the use of and/or seek the forfeiture of
	proceeds from illegal transactions; (ii) limit commercial transactions with designated countries or individuals believed to be
	terrorists, narcotics dealers or otherwise engaged in activities contrary to the interests of the United States; (iii) require
	identification and documentation of the parties with whom a Financial Institution conducts business; or (iv) are designed to disrupt
	the flow of funds to terrorist organizations. Such laws, regulations and sanctions shall be deemed to include the USA PATRIOT Act

	The purpose of this Questionnaire is to determine whether Subscribers are accredited investors and can invest in the Company’s
	securities. This material does not constitute an offer to sell nor is it a solicitation of an offer to buy securities, which offer
	may be made only pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Agreement to which this Questionnaire is an exhibit.


	 


	Answers to this Questionnaire will be kept
	confidential, provided they may be disclosed to (i) such parties as required to provide assurance that the sale of Securities will
	not result or has not resulted in violations of securities laws which are being relied upon by the Company in connection with the
	offer and sale thereof, and (ii) governmental authorities as may be required by law pursuant to subpoena, investigation or enforcement
	action from or by such authority.


	 


	If securities are to be purchased by more
	than one individual or entity, a separate Questionnaire should be completed for each.

	4.

	     


	Reservation of Stock

	. On and after the Date, the Company shall reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock
	a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of Warrant Stock upon the exercise or conversion of this Warrant. Issuance

	certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Warrant Stock issuable upon the exercise or conversion
	of this Warrant.


	 


	5.

	     


	Exercise of Warrant

	.


	 


	(a)

	   

	This Warrant may be exercised as a whole or part by the Holder, at any time after the date hereof prior to the termination
	of this Warrant, by the surrender of this Warrant, together with the Notice of Exercise and Investment Representation Statement
	in the forms attached hereto as

	Attachments 1 and 2

	, respectively, duly completed and delivered to the principal office
	of the Company, specifying the portion of the Warrant to be exercised and accompanied by payment in full of the Warrant Price in
	cash or by check with respect to the shares of Warrant Stock being purchased. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised
	immediately prior to the close of business on the date of its surrender for exercise as provided above, and the person entitled
	to receive the shares of Warrant Stock issuable upon such exercise shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of such shares
	of record as of the close of business on such date. As promptly as practicable after such date, the Company shall issue and deliver
	to the person or persons entitled to receive the same a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Warrant Stock
	issuable upon such exercise. If this Warrant shall be exercised for less than the total number of shares of Warrant Stock then
	issuable upon exercise, promptly after surrender of this Warrant upon such exercise, the Company will execute and deliver a new
	warrant, dated the date hereof, evidencing the right of the Holder to the balance of this Warrant Stock purchasable hereunder upon
	the same terms and conditions set forth herein.


	 


	(b)

	  

	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Warrant, this Warrant shall not be exercisable by the Holder
	hereof to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to ensure that, following such exercise, the total number of shares of
	Common Stock then beneficially owned by Holder and its affiliates and any other persons whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock
	would be aggregated with the Holder’s for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, does not exceed 4.999% of the total
	number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. For such purposes, beneficial ownership shall be determined in
	accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holder
	may waive such limitation on exercise contained in this Section 5(b) or increase or decrease such limitation percentage to any
	other percentage as specified in a written notice to the Company no less than sixty (60) days from the effective date of such increase
	or decrease.


	 


	(c)

	   

	If at any time after the six (6) month anniversary of the Date, there is no effective Registration Statement registering,
	or no current prospectus available for, the resale of the Warrant Stock by the Holder, then this Warrant may also be exercised,
	in whole or in part, at such time by means of a “cashless exercise” in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive
	a number of Warrant Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:


	 








	 



	3



	 







	 




	 


	(A) = the
	volume weighted average price (“

	VWAP

	”) on the business day immediately preceding the date on which Holder elects
	to exercise this Warrant by means of a “cashless exercise,” as set forth in the applicable Notice of Exercise;


	 


	(B) = the Warrant Price of this
	Warrant, as adjusted hereunder; and


	 


	(X) =
	the number of Warrant Stock that would be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms of this Warrant if
	such exercise were by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.


	 


	Notwithstanding anything herein
	to the contrary, on the Termination Date, this Warrant shall be automatically exercised via cashless exercise pursuant to this
	Section 5(c).


	 


	6.

	     


	Transfer of Warrant

	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, subject to applicable securities laws, this
	Warrant may be transferred or assigned in whole or in part by the Holder, and the Company shall permit such transfer or assignment
	to an affiliate of the Holder.


	 


	7.

	     


	Redemption



	 


	(a)

	   

	Warrants may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, upon the notice referred to in Section 7(b) at the prevailing market
	price or $17.00, whichever is greater, per Warrant (the “

	Redemption Price

	”), provided, that the Common Stock
	is quoted on or listed for trading on either The New York Stock Exchange, The

	Nasdaq

	Global Market, The NASDAQ Capital Market, The

	Nasdaq

	Global Select Market or the
	NYSE MKT.


	 


	(b)

	  

	In the event the Company shall elect to redeem the Warrant, the Company shall fix a date for the redemption. Notice of redemption
	shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, by the Company not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed for
	redemption to the Holder at their last addresses as they shall appear on the registration books. Any notice mailed in the manner
	herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date sent whether or not the Holder received such
	notice.


	 


	(c)

	   

	The Warrant may be exercised for cash in accordance with Section 5 of this Warrant at any time after notice of redemption
	shall have been given by the Company and prior to the time and date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, the
	record holder of the Warrant shall have no further rights except to receive the Redemption Price upon surrender of the Warrant.


	 


	(d)

	  

	The Company understands that the redemption rights provided for by this Section 7 apply only to outstanding Warrants. To
	the extent a person holds rights to purchase Warrant, such purchase rights shall not be extinguished by redemption. However, once
	such purchase rights are exercised, the Company may redeem the Warrant issued upon such exercise provided that the criteria for
	redemption is met, including the opportunity of the holders to exercise prior to redemption pursuant to Section 7.


	 


	8.

	     


	Termination

	. This Warrant shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Termination Date, subject to
	earlier termination as set forth in Section 2(c) hereof.


	 


	9.

	     


	Miscellaneous

	. This Warrant shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada, as such laws are applied to contracts
	to be entered into and performed entirely in Nevada. In the event of any dispute among the Holder and the Company arising out of
	the terms of this Warrant, the parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in
	the State of Nevada for resolution of such dispute, and agree not to contest such exclusive jurisdiction or seek to transfer any
	action relating to such dispute to any other jurisdiction. The headings in this Warrant are for purposes of convenience and reference
	only, and shall not be deemed to constitute a part hereof. Neither this Warrant nor any term hereof may be changed or waived orally,
	but only by an instrument in writing signed by the Company and the Holder of this Warrant.

	INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION STATEMENT


	 


	Shares of Common Stock of RMR Industrials,
	Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “

	Company

	”)


	 


	In connection with
	the purchase of the above-listed securities, the undersigned hereby represents to the Company as follows:


	 


	(a)

	               

	The securities to be received upon the exercise of the Warrant (the “

	Securities

	”) will be acquired for
	investment for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the sale or distribution, within the meaning
	of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “

	Securities Act

	”) of any part thereof, and the undersigned has
	no present intention of selling, granting participation in or otherwise distributing the same, other than to its affiliates, but
	subject, nevertheless, to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property shall at all times be within its control.
	By executing this statement, the undersigned further represents that it does not, other than in connection with transfers to its
	affiliates, have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer, or grant participations
	to such person or to any third person, with respect to any Securities issuable upon exercise of the Warrant.


	 


	(b)

	              

	The undersigned understands that the Securities issuable upon exercise of the Warrant at the time of issuance may not be
	registered under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, on the ground that the issuance of such securities is
	exempt pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and state law exemptions relating to offers and sales not by means of a public
	offering, and that the Company’s reliance on such exemptions is predicated on the undersigned’s representations set
	forth herein.


	 


	(c)

	               

	The undersigned agrees that in no event will it make a disposition of any Securities acquired upon the exercise of the Warrant
	unless and until the undersigned provides, at the Company’s request, an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
	Company that such transfer does not require registration under the Securities Act and the securities laws applicable with respect
	to any other applicable jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no opinion of counsel shall be necessary and such transfer
	or assignment by the undersigned shall be permitted (a) if such transfer or assignment is to an affiliate of the undersigned or
	(b) if the Company becomes the subject of foreign ownership, control or influence and such transfer or assignment is to a charitable
	organization.


	 


	(d)

	              

	The undersigned acknowledges that an investment in the Company is highly speculative and represents that it is able to fend
	for itself in the transactions contemplated by this statement, has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
	as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investments, and has the ability to bear the economic risks (including
	the risk of a total loss) of its investment. The undersigned represents that it has had the opportunity to ask questions of the
	Company concerning the Company’s business and assets and to obtain any additional information which it considered necessary
	to verify the accuracy of or to amplify the Company’s disclosures, and has had all questions which have been asked by it
	satisfactorily answered by the Company


	 


	(e)

	               

	The undersigned acknowledges that the Securities issuable upon exercise or conversion of the Warrant must be held indefinitely
	unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. The undersigned is
	aware of the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which permit limited resale of shares purchased in a private
	placement subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among other things, the existence of a public market for
	the shares, the availability of certain current public information about the Company, the resale occurring not less than six months
	after a party has purchased and paid for the security to be sold from the Company or any affiliate of the Company, the sale being
	through a “broker’s transaction” or in transactions directly with a “market maker” (as provided by
	Rule 144(f)) and the number of shares being sold during any three month period not exceeding specified limitations.

	AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO


	SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF
	2002


	 


	I, Chad Brownstein, certify that:


	 






	1.


	I have reviewed this Quarterly Report of RMR Industrials, Inc. for the period ended June 30, 2016.




	 






	2.


	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
	omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
	were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;




	 






	3.


	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this
	report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Registrant
	as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;




	 






	4.


	The Registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining
	disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial
	reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Registrant and have:




	 







	(a)




	Designed such disclosure
	controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that
	material information relating to the Registrant, including its subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
	particularly during the period in which the report is being prepared;





	 







	(b)




	Designed such internal
	control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision,
	to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
	external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;





	 







	(c)




	Evaluated the effectiveness
	of the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
	of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and





	 







	(d)




	Disclosed in this report
	any change in the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant’s most
	recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
	or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and





	 






	5.


	The Registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
	evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the Registrant’s
	board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):




	  







	(a)




	All significant deficiencies
	and material weaknesses in the design of operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
	adversely affect the Registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and





	 







	(b)




	Any fraud, whether or not
	material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrant’s internal control over
	financial reporting.
