Mark P. Robinson, Jr. is the founder, senior partner and sole shareholder of Robinson Calcagnie, Inc., based in Newport Beach, California. Mr. Robinson earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University and graduated cum laude from Loyola School of Law. He has established a prominent legal practice devoted to consumer safety and has worked on thousands of products liability cases, including the landmark Ford Pinto case, Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company, where a jury in Orange County, California, awarded $128 million in compensatory and punitive damages. The verdict was recognized by the Association of Trial Lawyers of America as one of the ten most significant civil trials of the past millennium.
Mr. Robinson’s other significant trials include: Anderson v. General Motors, where a Los  Angeles jury awarded $4.9 billion to burn victims in an  automobile crash; Barnett v. Merck, a $51 million verdict in New Orleans federal court against the manufacturer of the prescription drug Vioxx; Ketchum vs. Hyundai, where a Los Angeles County jury awarded $15 million to a young boy paralyzed by a defective seat belt during a collision; Oliver vs. Nissan, where a jury returned a $9 million verdict in a product liability action in Los Angeles County; Siu v. General Motors, a $9 million judgment in a product liability action in San Diego; and Fair v. Ford, a $12 million award in a wrongful death action in Kentucky arising from a post-collision fire involving a school bus.

Mr. Robinson was the 2014 National President of the American Board of Trial Advocates (ABOTA), a national association of experienced trial lawyers and judges with chapters in all 50 states. He is a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, a highly selective professional society of trial lawyers and judges (including the justices of the United States Supreme Court) whose members are selected only by invitation. He is a past president of the Orange County Chapter of the American Board of Trial Advocates. In 2011, he was chosen to serve on the Judicial Council of California Court Case Management Internal Committee.
In June of 2013, Mr. Robinson received the Philip Burton Lifetime Legal Achievement Award from Consumer Watchdog, a national non-profit organization which advocates for taxpayer and consumer interests. In 2011, he was inducted by the California Bar Association Litigation Section into their Trial Lawyer Hall of Fame. In 2010, as well as in 1999, Mr. Robinson received the California Attorney of the Year (CLAY) Award, presented annually by California Lawyer magazine to attorneys whose achievements have made a profound impact on the law. In 2008, he was named California ABOTA Trial Lawyer of the Year for California, and was also honored by the Anti-Defamation League (Orange County/Long Beach) with the Marcus Kaufman Jurisprudence Award. In 2007, he received the Champion of Justice Award from the Civil Justice Program in Southern California, and in 2006, he was named “Mass Tort Trial Lawyer of the Year” by the Orange County Trial Lawyers Association. Mr. Robinson is also a Founding Member of the Orange County Bar Foundation, a non-profit charitable organization that offers programs and services aimed at helping youth, their families and the community.
For many years, Mr. Robinson has been listed in The Best Lawyers in America®, a peer-reviewed survey listing outstanding attorneys throughout the United States, and has been consistently named as one of the Top 100 Lawyers in the State of California. He has also been named by the attorney rating service Super Lawyers to their 2014 Top 50 Orange County and Top 100 Southern California lists. In 2001, California Law Business named Mr. Robinson one of the top ten “Most Influential Lawyers in California.” In 1999, he was elected to serve as President of the Consumer Attorneys of California (CAOC), formerly the California Trial Lawyers Association. In 1996 and 1978, Mr. Robinson was honored as “Personal Injury Trial Lawyer of the Year” by the Orange County Trial Lawyers Association. He has served as a Board Member of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA) [now the American Association for Justice (AAJ)], the Association of Business Trial Lawyers Orange County Chapter, and the International Society of Barristers. He is one of the five founders of the Attorney Information Exchange Group (AIEG). He is a past President of the Orange County Trial Lawyers Association, and in 2001, served as President of the Orange County Bar Association Charitable Fund. He has also served as Lawyer Representative to the 9th Circuit Judicial Conference (1999-2002).

Home Verdicts & Settlements $15.0 Million - Seatbelt Failure
   $15 Million – Seatbelt Failure
A jury in Los Angeles County awarded $15 million to a 9-year-old boy who was left paralyzed and brain-damaged after a freeway collision. The action alleged that the plaintiff’s injuries were caused by defects in the vehicle’s occupant restraint system‚ and the failure of the manufacturer to provide adequate instructions and warnings.
Verdictum Juris
Volume 14 Issue 8

OUR CENTERFOLD…A VERY EXPENSIVE SEAT BELT: In 1988, Hyundai figured they could meet Federal Safety Standards regarding seat belts by installing a shoulder harness and doing away with the lap belt. This would save money . . . right? Well‚ recently down in Norwalk‚ Mark P. Robinson‚ Jr., Kevin Calcagnie and William Haggerty proved how wrong Hyundai was in making that decision. Bill Hart‚ Darrell Forgey, and house counsel for Hyundai, Jerry Flannery, knew they were in trouble when they raised the offer from $100‚000 to a million on the fourth day of deliberations. Three days later‚ the verdict was read . . . a whopping $15‚040‚000. Our records indicate this is by far the highest award ever on a seat belt case. The moral: you can install a whole lot of seat belts for $15 million!
Facts

September 12, 1990, at night: Plaintiff Adam‚ 9 years old‚ was a passenger in the right front seat of a 1988 Hyundai Excel. His mother was driving. She was entering the northbound Del Amo on-ramp to the 605 Freeway. In front of her was an illegally parked, 119‚000-pound tractor-trailer rig. There were no flares or warnings that the rig was blocking the on ramp. Adam’s mother hit the parked rig at a speed of 35 to 48 mph. Adam was belted in with the Hyundai standard seat belt. This was a two-point, diagonal seat belt which did not have a lap belt. At impact‚ Adam slid under the diagonal seat belt and was choked by the seat belt that was across his throat.
Plaintiff claimed the design of the seat belt was defective because it failed to provide a lap belt restraint. The defendants knew that small children were vulnerable to serious injury because they could slide under the seat belt‚ running the risk of serious neck or head injury. The belt compressed Adam’s neck leading to anoxia and permanent brain damage. Compliance with Federal Standards did not exempt the defendant from the strict liability laws of the State of California.
Defendant argued that the accident was totally the fault of Sandy Ketchum and the negligent tractor trailer company. The severity of the crash was the proximate cause Adam’s head injury. Adam did not suffer anoxia from the seat belt. The plaintiff’s injury was rather diffuse axonal brain injury. Also‚ the vehicle’s restraint met all Federal Safety Standards‚ including Standard 208.
Verdict
$15‚040‚000 total; Adam Ketchum: $13 million economic damages‚ $2 million non-economic damages; Robert Ketchum‚ Jr.: $40‚000 economic.

For this fine Saturday (at least, it’s fine here in Montana), here’s another gem from Stanley – the No. 79 Side Rabbet plane. It was used for cleaning up rough-cut rabbets, and has two cutters, one for cutting in each direction (left or right). In production from 1926-1973, it was a somewhat cheaper alternative to buying the No. 98 and No. 99 right and left pair, which went out of production around 1942.  
Even without the type two Sweetheart irons, which appear to be original and would put it between 1926 (first date of manufacture) and 1935 (last date of the Sweetheart logo), we can date this example to pre-1950 because of the large semi-circular cutout in the main casting. Later examples did not have this, and added a full length detachable depth stop.  
What fascinates me about this plane is that, through heavy use, the nickel plate has worn off pretty well anywhere that it would be touched and held by the user – not unusual in itself, but in this case, it appears to be nickel over copper plate on the main casting. I’ve never noticed this before, and to me it makes the evidence of wear appear almost artistic!  
Incidentally, the background is the lid of an as yet unidentified Stanley toolbox, featuring original yellow and blue paint, from the Sweetheart era (based on the tools it contained!).  
If you’re interested in seeing a lot of great antique and vintage Stanley tools, plus some original content about this great brand, please visit my friends over at @Stanley_Tool_Heritage, or check out their hashtag.
