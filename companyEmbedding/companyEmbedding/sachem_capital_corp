Bridging the Gap Between Real Estate Investors and Capital
At Sachem Capital, we are a Connecticut-based real estate finance company that specializes in originating, servicing and managing a portfolio of first mortgage loans. We offer short-term (i.e., three years or less), secured, non-banking loans (sometimes referred to as "hard money" loans) to real estate investors to fund their acquisition, renovation, rehabilitation, development or improvement of residential or commercial properties located primarily in Connecticut as well as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York.
Nimble Yet Disciplined Strategy Provides Investors with Attractive Returns
Our ability to react quickly to the needs of borrowers, our flexibility in terms of structuring loans to meet the needs of borrowers, our intimate knowledge of the New England real estate market, our expertise in "hard money" lending and our focus on newly originated first mortgage loans, sets the stage for strong growth and attractive returns for our investors.
View Business Strategy
Solid and Improving Demographics Create Opportunity
Real estate values throughout New England and particularly in Connecticut are stable and substandard properties are being improved, rehabilitated and renovated. In addition to this uptrend, our flexibility in structuring loans makes us more attractive to developers in the area, creating a strong opportunity for growth.

About Axiom Capital
















Our Vision
Building and managing wealth for high-net-worth individuals and institutions
Axiom Capital Management is built on a foundation of experience, insight, commitment to fulfilling customer needs, and accessing financial solutions through our vast network of financial services industry relationships. Responsive and accessible to a degree that banks, traditional broker/dealers, and mutual funds cannot match, Axiom is the institutional and high-net-worth investor’s alternative capital management firm.
Wealth is different
For the average investor, diversification and asset allocation can be as simple as placing a certain percentage of investment capital in fixed income products, a certain percentage in equities, and trying to keep an eye on time horizons for typical investment goals such as retirement and education. But building and maintaining wealth requires a higher level of sophistication in deploying investment capital. Axiom has the decades of collective Street experience, the maturity, the contacts, and the innate product knowledge required to build and preserve wealth.
Founded in 1990, Axiom Capital Management, Inc. is a full service broker-dealer.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of our common
shares in this offering will be approximately $11.2 million (or approximately
$13.0 million if the representative exercises its over-allotment option in 
full), after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purpose of this offering is to raise additional funds to increase
our loan portfolio. As a real estate finance company whose primary source of
income is interest generated from our loan portfolio, the only way for us to
increase our revenue is to increase the size of our loan portfolio.

The table below sets forth our expected use of the net proceeds from this
offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business
conditions.

                                                  Amount               Percentage
Funding loans                              $       11,000,000                98.2 %
Capital expenditures                                  125,000                 1.1
Working capital and general corporate                                             
purposes                                               75,000                 0.7
                                           $       11,200,000               100.0 %

Funding loans. Approximately $11.0 million, or 98.2%, of the net proceeds of
this offering will be used to fund new loans and grow our loan portfolio.

Capital expenditures. We plan to make various renovations to the building we
purchased on Main Street in Branford, Connecticut that will serve as our new
corporate headquarters. We estimate the cost of the renovations will be
approximately $125,000.

Working capital. As a result of our conversion to REIT status and the
consummation of this offering we expect that our general and administrative
expenses, such as compensation and other employee-related expenses, insurance,
rent, legal and accounting, will increase on account of our various reporting
and compliance obligations and our expanded operations.

We may also use the net proceeds to pay down, on a temporary basis, the
outstanding balance on the Bankwell Credit Line.

Pending the application of any portion of the net proceeds, we may invest such
funds in interest bearing accounts and short-term, interest bearing securities
that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT and maintain our
exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. These investments
are expected to provide lower returns than those we will seek to achieve from
our loan portfolio.


The real estate finance market in Connecticut is highly competitive. Our
competitors include traditional lending institutions such as regional and local
banks, savings and loan institutions, credit unions and other financial
institutions as well as other market participants such as specialty finance
companies, REITs, investment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, private
equity funds, family offices and high net worth individuals. In addition, we
estimate that, in addition to us, there are approximately five “hard money”
lenders of significant size serving the Connecticut real estate market. Many of
these competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including greater name
recognition, established lending relationships with customers, financial
resources, and access to capital.

Notwithstanding the intense competition and some of our competitive 
disadvantages, we believe we have carved a niche for ourselves among small real
estate developers, owners and contractors throughout Connecticut and in parts of
Massachusetts and New York because we are relatively well-capitalized, our
ability to structure each loan to suit the needs of each individual borrower and
our ability to act quickly. In addition, we believe we have developed a 
reputation among these borrowers as offering reasonable terms and providing
outstanding customer service. We believe our future success will depend on our
ability to maintain and capitalize on our existing relationships with borrowers
and brokers and to expand our borrower base by continuing to offer attractive
loan products, remain competitive in pricing and terms, and provide superior
service.


Company Description
We are a Connecticut-based real estate finance company that specializes in
originating, underwriting, funding, servicing and managing a portfolio of
short-term (i.e., three years or less) loans secured by first mortgage liens on
real property located primarily in Connecticut. Each loan is also


 personally
guaranteed by the principal(s) of the borrower, which guaranty is typically
collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower.
Our typical borrower is a small real estate investor who will use the proceeds
to fund its acquisition, renovation, rehabilitation, development and/or
improvement of residential or commercial properties located primarily in
Connecticut held for investment or sale. The property may or may not be income
producing. We do not lend to owner-occupants. Our loans are referred to in the
real estate finance industry as “hard money loans.”

We believe that upon completion of this offering we will meet all of the
requirements to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal
income tax purposes and we intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT beginning with
the year in which this offering is consummated.

Since commencing operations in 2010, SCP has made over 370 loans. Since we treat
renewals and extensions of existing loans as new loans, we cannot determine how
many of the 370 loans fall into this category. At September 30, 2016, (i) SCP’s
loan portfolio included 202 loans with an aggregate loan amount of approximately
$30.6 million with the principal amount of individual loans ranging from 25,000
to $1.1 million, (ii) the average original principal amount of the loans in
SCP’s portfolio was $151,277 and the median loan amount was $108,000 and (iii)
approximately 86% of the loans had a principal amount of $250,000 or less. At
December 31, 2015, (i) SCP’s loan portfolio included 180 loans with an aggregate
loan amount of approximately $27.5 million with the principal amount of
individual loans ranging from $20,000 to $1.7 million, (ii) the average original
principal amount of the loans in SCP’s portfolio was $152,000 and the median
loan amount was $112,000 and (iii) approximately 87% of the loans had a
principal amount of $250,000 or less. At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 unfunded commitments for future advances under construction loans totaled
$1.07 million and $1.26 million, respectively.

Our loans typically have a maximum initial term of three years and bear interest
at a fixed rate of 9% to 12% per year and a default rate for non-payment of 18%.
However, beginning in February 1, 2017, we plan to increase our rates on new
loans to match increases to our borrowing rate. In addition, we usually receive
origination fees, or “points,” ranging from 2% to 5% of the original principal
amount of the loan as well as other fees relating to underwriting, funding and
managing the loan. When we renew or extend a loan we generally receive
additional “points” and other fees. Interest is always payable monthly in
arrears. As a matter of policy, we do not make any loans if the original
principal amount of the loan exceeds 65% of the value of the property securing
the loan (referred to as the “loan-to-value ratio”). In the case of construction
loans, the loan-to-value ratio is based on the post-construction value of the
property. In the case of loans having a principal amount in excess of $500,000,
we require a formal appraisal by a licensed appraiser. In the case of smaller
loans, we rely on readily available market data, including tax assessment rolls,
recent sales transactions and brokers to evaluate the strength of the
collateral. Our lender requires an appraisal for any loan in excess of $325,000.
Failure to obtain such an appraisal would render the loan ineligible for
financing under our credit facility. Finally, we have adopted a policy, to take
effect on the date of this prospectus, that will limit the maximum amount of any
loan we fund to a single borrower or a group of affiliated borrowers to 10% of
the aggregate amount of our loan portfolio after taking into account the loan
under consideration. 

Our principal executive officers are experienced in hard money lending under
various economic and market conditions. Our founders and co-chief executive
officers, Jeffrey C. Villano and John L. Villano, spend a significant portion of
their time on business development as well as on underwriting, structuring and
servicing each loan in our portfolio. A principal source of new transactions has
been repeat business from existing and former customers and their referral of
new business. We also receive leads for new business from banks, brokers,
attorneys and web-based advertising.
---

Our principal executive offices are currently located at 23 Laurel Street,
Branford, Connecticut 06405 and our telephone number is (203) 433-4736. On
December 9, 2016, SCP acquired the property located at 698 Main Street,
Branford, Connecticut. The property is improved with two buildings, one of which
will become our new principal offices. The URL for our website is
