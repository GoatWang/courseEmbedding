Content Management on Google MapsCartogram enables native, drag-and-drop content management for over 20 layers on your venue maps. We use Google Maps as a surface to draw your data, which lives inside of Cartogram’s private cloud services. Your venue data stays private and never gets sent to Google.
Powerful In-Venue Search EngineEnable visitors to find services, points of interest, and products inside of your venue which is automatically configured with Cartogram’s indoor map CMS.Multi-Venue WayfindingNavigating indoors is a must-have. Navigating outdoors has been around for awhile. What if you want to do both, seamlessly? Cartogram is the only company bridging the gap between indoor and outdoor navigation. Great for corporate and college campuses as well as for parking routing at sports venues and malls.Live Indoor MapsYour venue is changes daily; shouldn’t your indoor maps? Cartogram provides built-in scheduling to show users what’s happening now inside your venue like meetings, classes, and events.IoT ManagementMonitor and manage beacon, access points, switches, sensors, cameras, controllers, detectors, smartphones, kiosks, right from your smartphone.

Turn-by-Turn Indoor DirectionsMore than just a dot on a map, Cartogram enables administrators to modify building routing in seconds and provide turn-by-turn indoor directions to users.
Accurate Line Wait Times Most line wait time technology requires cameras or BLE beacons. With Cartogram, we can enable the most accurate line wait times your money can buy. Even better, there’s no app required to track your visitor’s precise indoor location.
Indoor DeliveryYou have customers inside of your venue that are preoccupied, but who want to purchase goods and services from you. How do you help them? Cartogram’s indoor location sharing and indoor delivery services enable turn-key solutions inside of any venue, even when the location of the user isn’t associated with a seat number or pre-defined location.

I would love the option to map it myself as a "Verified Mapper", at least identifying bathrooms/drinking fountains and mapping public/govern buildings. still leaving the fine details upto the business owners. Payoff for you is a rapidly expanded database and payout when Google buys you out.   Full Review       Cartogram Inc June 25, 2015  Hi Tad: My name is Will Clausen and I'm the CEO of Cartogram. I am reaching out to you directly because I thought that your comment was thoughtful and genuine. If you want to help Cartogram add/update indoor maps, then by all means, we would love your help!

Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

Web beacons are not used to access any personal information you may provide in the course of registering for use of the Service; they are solely used to compile aggregated statistics concerning the use of the Services.

Data Security: To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to protect the personal information we collect. We use SSL encryption for submission of personal and credit card information and other sensitive data when it is transmitted between you and our servers.

We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems. However, the Internet is not 100% secure and as new technology evolves and emerges, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent, but diligently strive to avoid, third-party interferences from illegally obtaining or tampering with your personal information.
We encourage you to help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you use the Service.

Cartogram

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Not to be confused with cartography.




Kartenanamorphote (not Kartogramm) of Germany, with the states and districts resized according to population.


A cartogram is a map in which some thematic mapping variable – such as travel time, population, or Gross National Product – is substituted for land area or distance. The geometry or space of the map is distorted in order to convey the information of this alternate variable. They are primarily used to display emphasis and for analysis as nomographs.[1]
Two common types of cartograms: area and distance cartograms. Cartograms have a fairly long history, with examples from the mid-1800s.[2]

Area cartograms[edit]




Area cartogram of the United States, with each county rescaled in proportion to its population. Colors refer to the results of the 2004 U.S. presidential election popular vote.






Area cartogram of the world with each country rescaled in proportion to the hectares of certified organic farming[3]


An area cartogram is sometimes referred to as a value-by-area map or an isodemographic map, the latter particularly for a population cartogram, which illustrates the relative sizes of the populations of the countries of the world by scaling the area of each country in proportion to its population; the shape and relative location of each country is retained to as large an extent as possible, but inevitably a large amount of distortion results. Other synonyms in use are anamorphic map, density-equalizing map and Gastner map.[4][5][6]
Area cartograms may be contiguous or noncontiguous. The area cartograms shown on this page are all contiguous, while a good example of a noncontiguous cartogram was published in The New York Times.[7][8] This method of cartogram creation is sometimes referred to as the projector method or scaled-down regions.
Cartograms may be classified also by the properties of shape and topology preservation. Classical area cartograms (shown on this page) are typically distorting the shape of spatial units to some degree, but they are strict at preserving correct neighborhood relationships between them. Scaled-down cartograms (from the NY Times example) are strictly shape-preserving. Another branch of cartograms introduced by Dorling, replaces actual shapes with circles scaled according to the mapped feature. Circles are distributed to resemble the original topology. Demers cartogram is a variation of Dorling cartogram, but it uses rectangles instead of circles, and attempts to retain visual cues at the expense of minimum distance. Schematic maps based on quad trees can be seen as non shape-preserving cartograms with some degree of neighborhood preservation.
A collection of about 700 contiguous area cartograms is available at Worldmapper,[9] a collaborative team of researchers at the Universities of Sheffield and Michigan.

One of the first cartographers to generate cartograms with the aid of computer visualization was Waldo Tobler of UC Santa Barbara in the 1960s. Prior to Tobler's work, cartograms were created by hand (as they occasionally still are). The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis located on the UCSB campus maintains an online Cartogram Central with resources regarding cartograms.
A number of software packages generate cartograms. Most of the available cartogram generation tools work in conjunction with other GIS software tools as add-ons or independently produce cartographic outputs from GIS data formatted to work with commonly used GIS products. Examples of cartogram software include ScapeToad,[10][11] Cart,[12] and the Cartogram Processing Tool (an ArcScript for ESRI's ArcGIS), which all use the Gastner-Newman algorithm.[13][14] An alternative algorithm, Carto3F,[15] is also implemented as an independent program for non-commercial use on Windows platforms.[16] This program also provides an optimization to the original Dougenik rubber-sheet algorithm.[17] [18] The CRAN package recmap provides an implementation of a rectangular cartogram algorithm.[19]

One of the first cartographers to generate cartograms with the aid of computer visualization was Waldo Tobler of UC Santa Barbara in the 1960s. Prior to Tobler's work, cartograms were created by hand (as they occasionally still are). The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis located on the UCSB campus maintains an online Cartogram Central with resources regarding cartograms.
A number of software packages generate cartograms. Most of the available cartogram generation tools work in conjunction with other GIS software tools as add-ons or independently produce cartographic outputs from GIS data formatted to work with commonly used GIS products. Examples of cartogram software include ScapeToad,[10][11] Cart,[12] and the Cartogram Processing Tool (an ArcScript for ESRI's ArcGIS), which all use the Gastner-Newman algorithm.[13][14] An alternative algorithm, Carto3F,[15] is also implemented as an independent program for non-commercial use on Windows platforms.[16] This program also provides an optimization to the original Dougenik rubber-sheet algorithm.[17] [18] The CRAN package recmap provides an implementation of a rectangular cartogram algorithm.[19]

Cartogram - Wikipedia






















 






Cartogram

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Not to be confused with cartography.




Kartenanamorphote (not Kartogramm) of Germany, with the states and districts resized according to population.


A cartogram is a map in which some thematic mapping variable – such as travel time, population, or Gross National Product – is substituted for land area or distance. The geometry or space of the map is distorted in order to convey the information of this alternate variable. They are primarily used to display emphasis and for analysis as nomographs.[1]
Two common types of cartograms: area and distance cartograms. Cartograms have a fairly long history, with examples from the mid-1800s.[2]

Area cartograms[edit]




Area cartogram of the United States, with each county rescaled in proportion to its population. Colors refer to the results of the 2004 U.S. presidential election popular vote.






Area cartogram of the world with each country rescaled in proportion to the hectares of certified organic farming[3]


An area cartogram is sometimes referred to as a value-by-area map or an isodemographic map, the latter particularly for a population cartogram, which illustrates the relative sizes of the populations of the countries of the world by scaling the area of each country in proportion to its population; the shape and relative location of each country is retained to as large an extent as possible, but inevitably a large amount of distortion results. Other synonyms in use are anamorphic map, density-equalizing map and Gastner map.[4][5][6]
Area cartograms may be contiguous or noncontiguous. The area cartograms shown on this page are all contiguous, while a good example of a noncontiguous cartogram was published in The New York Times.[7][8] This method of cartogram creation is sometimes referred to as the projector method or scaled-down regions.
Cartograms may be classified also by the properties of shape and topology preservation. Classical area cartograms (shown on this page) are typically distorting the shape of spatial units to some degree, but they are strict at preserving correct neighborhood relationships between them. Scaled-down cartograms (from the NY Times example) are strictly shape-preserving. Another branch of cartograms introduced by Dorling, replaces actual shapes with circles scaled according to the mapped feature. Circles are distributed to resemble the original topology. Demers cartogram is a variation of Dorling cartogram, but it uses rectangles instead of circles, and attempts to retain visual cues at the expense of minimum distance. Schematic maps based on quad trees can be seen as non shape-preserving cartograms with some degree of neighborhood preservation.
A collection of about 700 contiguous area cartograms is available at Worldmapper,[9] a collaborative team of researchers at the Universities of Sheffield and Michigan.

Cartogram - Wikipedia






















 






Cartogram

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Not to be confused with cartography.




Kartenanamorphote (not Kartogramm) of Germany, with the states and districts resized according to population.


A cartogram is a map in which some thematic mapping variable – such as travel time, population, or Gross National Product – is substituted for land area or distance. The geometry or space of the map is distorted in order to convey the information of this alternate variable. They are primarily used to display emphasis and for analysis as nomographs.[1]
Two common types of cartograms: area and distance cartograms. Cartograms have a fairly long history, with examples from the mid-1800s.[2]

Area cartograms[edit]




Area cartogram of the United States, with each county rescaled in proportion to its population. Colors refer to the results of the 2004 U.S. presidential election popular vote.






Area cartogram of the world with each country rescaled in proportion to the hectares of certified organic farming[3]


An area cartogram is sometimes referred to as a value-by-area map or an isodemographic map, the latter particularly for a population cartogram, which illustrates the relative sizes of the populations of the countries of the world by scaling the area of each country in proportion to its population; the shape and relative location of each country is retained to as large an extent as possible, but inevitably a large amount of distortion results. Other synonyms in use are anamorphic map, density-equalizing map and Gastner map.[4][5][6]
Area cartograms may be contiguous or noncontiguous. The area cartograms shown on this page are all contiguous, while a good example of a noncontiguous cartogram was published in The New York Times.[7][8] This method of cartogram creation is sometimes referred to as the projector method or scaled-down regions.
Cartograms may be classified also by the properties of shape and topology preservation. Classical area cartograms (shown on this page) are typically distorting the shape of spatial units to some degree, but they are strict at preserving correct neighborhood relationships between them. Scaled-down cartograms (from the NY Times example) are strictly shape-preserving. Another branch of cartograms introduced by Dorling, replaces actual shapes with circles scaled according to the mapped feature. Circles are distributed to resemble the original topology. Demers cartogram is a variation of Dorling cartogram, but it uses rectangles instead of circles, and attempts to retain visual cues at the expense of minimum distance. Schematic maps based on quad trees can be seen as non shape-preserving cartograms with some degree of neighborhood preservation.
A collection of about 700 contiguous area cartograms is available at Worldmapper,[9] a collaborative team of researchers at the Universities of Sheffield and Michigan.

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2011)


One of the first cartographers to generate cartograms with the aid of computer visualization was Waldo Tobler of UC Santa Barbara in the 1960s. Prior to Tobler's work, cartograms were created by hand (as they occasionally still are). The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis located on the UCSB campus maintains an online Cartogram Central with resources regarding cartograms.
A number of software packages generate cartograms. Most of the available cartogram generation tools work in conjunction with other GIS software tools as add-ons or independently produce cartographic outputs from GIS data formatted to work with commonly used GIS products. Examples of cartogram software include ScapeToad,[10][11] Cart,[12] and the Cartogram Processing Tool (an ArcScript for ESRI's ArcGIS), which all use the Gastner-Newman algorithm.[13][14] An alternative algorithm, Carto3F,[15] is also implemented as an independent program for non-commercial use on Windows platforms.[16] This program also provides an optimization to the original Dougenik rubber-sheet algorithm.[17] [18] The CRAN package recmap provides an implementation of a rectangular cartogram algorithm.[19]

Cartogram - Wikipedia






















 






Cartogram

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Not to be confused with cartography.




Kartenanamorphote (not Kartogramm) of Germany, with the states and districts resized according to population.


A cartogram is a map in which some thematic mapping variable – such as travel time, population, or Gross National Product – is substituted for land area or distance. The geometry or space of the map is distorted in order to convey the information of this alternate variable. They are primarily used to display emphasis and for analysis as nomographs.[1]
Two common types of cartograms: area and distance cartograms. Cartograms have a fairly long history, with examples from the mid-1800s.[2]

Area cartograms[edit]




Area cartogram of the United States, with each county rescaled in proportion to its population. Colors refer to the results of the 2004 U.S. presidential election popular vote.






Area cartogram of the world with each country rescaled in proportion to the hectares of certified organic farming[3]


An area cartogram is sometimes referred to as a value-by-area map or an isodemographic map, the latter particularly for a population cartogram, which illustrates the relative sizes of the populations of the countries of the world by scaling the area of each country in proportion to its population; the shape and relative location of each country is retained to as large an extent as possible, but inevitably a large amount of distortion results. Other synonyms in use are anamorphic map, density-equalizing map and Gastner map.[4][5][6]
Area cartograms may be contiguous or noncontiguous. The area cartograms shown on this page are all contiguous, while a good example of a noncontiguous cartogram was published in The New York Times.[7][8] This method of cartogram creation is sometimes referred to as the projector method or scaled-down regions.
Cartograms may be classified also by the properties of shape and topology preservation. Classical area cartograms (shown on this page) are typically distorting the shape of spatial units to some degree, but they are strict at preserving correct neighborhood relationships between them. Scaled-down cartograms (from the NY Times example) are strictly shape-preserving. Another branch of cartograms introduced by Dorling, replaces actual shapes with circles scaled according to the mapped feature. Circles are distributed to resemble the original topology. Demers cartogram is a variation of Dorling cartogram, but it uses rectangles instead of circles, and attempts to retain visual cues at the expense of minimum distance. Schematic maps based on quad trees can be seen as non shape-preserving cartograms with some degree of neighborhood preservation.
A collection of about 700 contiguous area cartograms is available at Worldmapper,[9] a collaborative team of researchers at the Universities of Sheffield and Michigan.

Production[edit]

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2011)


One of the first cartographers to generate cartograms with the aid of computer visualization was Waldo Tobler of UC Santa Barbara in the 1960s. Prior to Tobler's work, cartograms were created by hand (as they occasionally still are). The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis located on the UCSB campus maintains an online Cartogram Central with resources regarding cartograms.
A number of software packages generate cartograms. Most of the available cartogram generation tools work in conjunction with other GIS software tools as add-ons or independently produce cartographic outputs from GIS data formatted to work with commonly used GIS products. Examples of cartogram software include ScapeToad,[10][11] Cart,[12] and the Cartogram Processing Tool (an ArcScript for ESRI's ArcGIS), which all use the Gastner-Newman algorithm.[13][14] An alternative algorithm, Carto3F,[15] is also implemented as an independent program for non-commercial use on Windows platforms.[16] This program also provides an optimization to the original Dougenik rubber-sheet algorithm.[17] [18] The CRAN package recmap provides an implementation of a rectangular cartogram algorithm.[19]

The area cartograms shown on this page are all contiguous, while a good example of a noncontiguous cartogram was published in The New York Times.[7][8] This method of cartogram creation is sometimes referred to as the projector method or scaled-down regions.
Cartograms may be classified also by the properties of shape and topology preservation. Classical area cartograms (shown on this page) are typically distorting the shape of spatial units to some degree, but they are strict at preserving correct neighborhood relationships between them. Scaled-down cartograms (from the NY Times example) are strictly shape-preserving. Another branch of cartograms introduced by Dorling, replaces actual shapes with circles scaled according to the mapped feature. Circles are distributed to resemble the original topology. Demers cartogram is a variation of Dorling cartogram, but it uses rectangles instead of circles, and attempts to retain visual cues at the expense of minimum distance. Schematic maps based on quad trees can be seen as non shape-preserving cartograms with some degree of neighborhood preservation.
A collection of about 700 contiguous area cartograms is available at Worldmapper,[9] a collaborative team of researchers at the Universities of Sheffield and Michigan.

One of the first cartographers to generate cartograms with the aid of computer visualization was Waldo Tobler of UC Santa Barbara in the 1960s. Prior to Tobler's work, cartograms were created by hand (as they occasionally still are). The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis located on the UCSB campus maintains an online Cartogram Central with resources regarding cartograms.
A number of software packages generate cartograms. Most of the available cartogram generation tools work in conjunction with other GIS software tools as add-ons or independently produce cartographic outputs from GIS data formatted to work with commonly used GIS products. Examples of cartogram software include ScapeToad,[10][11] Cart,[12] and the Cartogram Processing Tool (an ArcScript for ESRI's ArcGIS), which all use the Gastner-Newman algorithm.[13][14] An alternative algorithm, Carto3F,[15] is also implemented as an independent program for non-commercial use on Windows platforms.[16] This program also provides an optimization to the original Dougenik rubber-sheet algorithm.[17] [18] The CRAN package recmap provides an implementation of a rectangular cartogram algorithm.[19]

Cartogram - Wikipedia






















 






Cartogram

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Not to be confused with cartography.




Kartenanamorphote (not Kartogramm) of Germany, with the states and districts resized according to population.


A cartogram is a map in which some thematic mapping variable – such as travel time, population, or Gross National Product – is substituted for land area or distance. The geometry or space of the map is distorted in order to convey the information of this alternate variable. They are primarily used to display emphasis and for analysis as nomographs.[1]
Two common types of cartograms: area and distance cartograms. Cartograms have a fairly long history, with examples from the mid-1800s.[2]

Area cartograms[edit]




Area cartogram of the United States, with each county rescaled in proportion to its population. Colors refer to the results of the 2004 U.S. presidential election popular vote.






Area cartogram of the world with each country rescaled in proportion to the hectares of certified organic farming[3]


An area cartogram is sometimes referred to as a value-by-area map or an isodemographic map, the latter particularly for a population cartogram, which illustrates the relative sizes of the populations of the countries of the world by scaling the area of each country in proportion to its population; the shape and relative location of each country is retained to as large an extent as possible, but inevitably a large amount of distortion results. Other synonyms in use are anamorphic map, density-equalizing map and Gastner map.[4][5][6]
Area cartograms may be contiguous or noncontiguous. The area cartograms shown on this page are all contiguous, while a good example of a noncontiguous cartogram was published in The New York Times.[7][8] This method of cartogram creation is sometimes referred to as the projector method or scaled-down regions.
Cartograms may be classified also by the properties of shape and topology preservation. Classical area cartograms (shown on this page) are typically distorting the shape of spatial units to some degree, but they are strict at preserving correct neighborhood relationships between them. Scaled-down cartograms (from the NY Times example) are strictly shape-preserving. Another branch of cartograms introduced by Dorling, replaces actual shapes with circles scaled according to the mapped feature. Circles are distributed to resemble the original topology. Demers cartogram is a variation of Dorling cartogram, but it uses rectangles instead of circles, and attempts to retain visual cues at the expense of minimum distance. Schematic maps based on quad trees can be seen as non shape-preserving cartograms with some degree of neighborhood preservation.
A collection of about 700 contiguous area cartograms is available at Worldmapper,[9] a collaborative team of researchers at the Universities of Sheffield and Michigan.
