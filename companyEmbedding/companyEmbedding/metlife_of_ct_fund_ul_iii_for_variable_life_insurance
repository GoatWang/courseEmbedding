 THE FUNDS

The Funds offered through this Policy are listed below. Some Funds may not be   
available in certain states. Each Fund is registered under the Investment       
Company Act of 1940 as an open-end, management investment company. These Funds  
are not publicly traded and are offered only through variable annuity and       
variable life insurance products, and maybe in some instances, certain          
retirement plans. They are not the same retail mutual funds as those offered    
outside of a variable annuity or variable life insurance product, although the  
investment practices and fund names may be similar, and the portfolio managers  
may be identical. Accordingly, the performance of the retail mutual fund is     
likely to be different from that of the Fund.                                   

We select the Funds offered through this Policy based on several criteria,      
including asset class coverage, the strength of the adviser's or subadviser's   
reputation and tenure, brand recognition, performance, and the capability and   
qualification of each investment firm. Another factor we consider during the    
selection process is whether the Fund's adviser or subadviser is one of our     
affiliates or whether the Fund, its adviser, its subadviser(s), or an affiliate 
will make payments to us or our affiliates. In this regard, the profit          
distributions we receive from our affiliated investment advisers are a component
of the total revenue that we consider in configuring the features and investment
choices available in the variable insurance products that we and our affiliated 
insurance companies issue. Since we and our affiliated insurance companies may  
benefit more from the allocation of assets to portfolios advised by our         
affiliates than those that are not, we may be more inclined to offer portfolios 
advised by our affiliates in the variable insurance products we issue. For      
additional information on these arrangements, see "Payments We Receive." We     
review the Funds periodically and may remove a Fund or limit its availability to
new Premiums and/or transfers of Cash Value if we determine that the Fund no    
longer meets one or more of the selection criteria, and/or if the Fund has not  
attracted significant allocations from Policy owners. In some cases, we have    
included Funds based on recommendations made by broker-dealer firms.            

WE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INVESTMENT ADVICE AND DO NOT RECOMMEND OR ENDORSE ANY     
PARTICULAR FUND. YOU BEAR THE RISK OF ANY DECLINE IN THE CASH VALUE OF YOUR     
POLICY RESULTING FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNDS YOU HAVE CHOSEN.             

If investment in the Funds or a particular Fund is no longer possible, in our   
judgment becomes inappropriate for purposes of the Policy, or for any other     
reason in our sole discretion, we may substitute another Fund or Funds without  
your consent. The substituted Fund may have different fees and expenses.        
Substitution may be made with respect to existing investments or the investment 
of future Premiums, or both. However, we will not make such substitution without
any necessary approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable 
state insurance departments. Furthermore, we may close Funds to allocations of  
Premiums or Cash Value, or both, at any time in our sole discretion.            

In certain circumstances, the Company's ability to remove or replace a Fund may 
be limited by the terms of a five-year agreement between MetLife, Inc. (MetLife)
and Legg Mason, Inc. (Legg Mason) relating to the use of certain Funds advised  
by Legg Mason affiliates. The agreement sets forth the conditions under which   
the Company can remove a Fund, which, in some cases, may differ from the        
Company's own selection criteria. In addition, during the term of the agreement,
subject to the Company's fiduciary and other legal duties, the Company is       
generally obligated in the first instance to consider Funds advised by Legg     
Mason affiliates in seeking to make a substitution for a Fund advised by a Legg 
Mason affiliate. The agreement was originally entered into on July 1, 2005 by   
MetLife and certain affiliates of Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup) as part of         
MetLife's acquisition of The Travelers Insurance Company (now MetLife Insurance 
Company of Connecticut) and The Travelers Life and Annuity Company (now MetLife 
Life and Annuity Company of Connecticut) from Citigroup. Legg Mason replaced the
Citigroup affiliates as a party to the agreement when Citigroup sold its asset  
management business to Legg Mason. The agreement also obligates Legg Mason to   
continue making payments to us with respect to the Funds advised by Legg Mason  
affiliates, on the same terms provided for in administrative service agreements 
between Citigroup's asset management affiliates and the Travelers insurance     
companies that predated the acquisition.                                        

PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE. As described above, an investment adviser (other than our  
affiliates MetLife Advisers, LLC, and Met Investors Advisory LLC) or subadviser 
of a Fund, or its affiliates, may make payments to the Company and/or certain of
our affiliates. These payments may be used for a variety of purposes, including 
payment of expenses for certain administrative, marketing, and support services 
with respect to the Policies and, in the Company's role as an intermediary, with
respect to the Funds. The Company and its affiliates may profit from these      
payments. These payments may be derived, in whole or in part, from the advisory 
fee deducted from Fund assets. Policy Owners, through their indirect investment 
in the Funds, bear the costs of these advisory fees (see the Funds' prospectuses
for

more information). The amount of the payments we receive is based on a          
percentage of assets of the Funds attributable to the Policies and certain other
variable insurance products that the Company and its affiliates issue. These    
percentages differ and some advisers or subadvisers (or other affiliates) may   
pay the Company more than others. These percentages currently range up to .50%. 

Additionally, an investment adviser or subadviser of a Fund or its affiliates   
may provide the Company with wholesaling services that assist in the            
distribution of the Policies and may pay the Company and/or certain of our      
affiliates amounts to participate in sales meetings. These amounts may be       
significant and may provide the adviser or subadviser (or their affiliate) with 
increased access to persons involved in the distribution of the Policies.       

The Company and/or certain of its affiliated insurance companies have joint     
ownership interests in its affiliated investment advisers MetLife Advisers, LLC 
and Met Investors Advisory LLC, which are formed as "limited liability          
companies." The Company's ownership interests in MetLife Advisers, LLC and Met  
Investors Advisory LLC entitle us to profit distributions if the adviser makes a
profit with respect to the advisory fees it receives from the Fund. The Company 
will benefit accordingly from assets allocated to the Funds to the extent they  
result in profits to the advisers. (See "Fee Table -- Fund Fees and Expenses"   
for information on the management fees paid by the Funds and the Statement of   
Additional Information for the Funds for information on the management fees paid
by the advisers to the subadvisers.)                                            

Certain Funds have adopted a Distribution Plan under Rule 12b-1 of the          
Investment Company Act of 1940. A Fund's 12b-1 Plan, if any, is described in    
more detail in the Fund's prospectus. (See "Fee Table -- Fund Fees and Expenses"
and "Distribution & Compensation.") Any payments we receive pursuant to those   
12b-1 Plans are paid to us or our distributor. Payments under a Fund's 12b-1    
Plan decrease the Fund's investment return.                                     

We pay American Funds Distributors, Inc., principal underwriter for the American
Funds Insurance Series, a percentage of all premiums allocated to the American  
Funds Global Growth Fund, the American Funds Growth Fund and the American Funds 
Growth-Income Fund for services it provides in marketing the Fund's shares in   
connection with the Policy.                                                     

Each Fund has different investment objectives and risks. The Fund prospectuses  
contain more detailed information on each Fund's investment strategy, investment
advisers and its fees. YOU MAY OBTAIN A FUND PROSPECTUS BY CALLING 1-800-334-   
4298 OR THROUGH YOUR INSURANCE AGENT. We do not guarantee the investment results
of the Funds.

 FUND CHARGES AND EXPENSES

The next tables describe the Fund charges and expenses that you will indirectly 
pay periodically during the time that you own the Policy. The Investment Options
purchase shares of the Funds at net asset value. The net asset value already    
reflects the deduction of each Fund's Total Operating Expenses. Therefore you   
are indirectly bearing the costs of Fund expenses.                              

The first table below shows the minimum and maximum fees and expenses, as a     
percentage of average daily net assets, charged by any of the Funds as of       
December 31, 2006. The second table shows each Fund's fees and expenses, as a   
percentage of average daily net assets, as of December 31, 2006, unless         
otherwise noted. This information was provided by the Funds and we have not     
independently verified it. More detail concerning each Fund's fees and expenses 
is contained in the prospectus for each Fund.

++    Fees and expenses of this Fund are based on the Fund's fiscal year ended  
October 31, 2006.                                                   
(1)   Other Expenses include 0.02% of "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses," which  
    are fees and expenses attributable to underlying portfolios in which the
Portfolio invested during the preceding fiscal year.                
(2)   Other Expenses include 0.01% for the Franklin Small-Mid Cap Growth        
    Securities Fund, and 0.03% for the Templeton Foreign Securities Fund, of
"Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses," which are fees and expenses      
 attributable to underlying portfolios in which the Portfolio invested
  during the preceding fiscal year. The manager has agreed in advance to
   reduce its fee from assets invested by the Fund in a Franklin Templeton
    money market fund (the acquired fund) to the extent that the Fund's fees
 and expenses are due to those of the acquired fund. This reduction is
   required by the Trust's board of trustees and an exemptive order of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).                           
(3)   Other Expenses include 0.02% of "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses," which  
    are fees and expenses attributable to underlying portfolios in which the
Portfolio invested during the preceding fiscal year.                
(4)   The Portfolio pays an investment advisory fee rate that may adjust up or  
 down based upon the Portfolio's performance relative to its benchmark
    index during a measuring period. This fee rate, prior to any performance
    adjustment, is shown in the table above. Any such adjustment to this fee
    rate commenced February 2007 and may increase or decrease the management
fee rate shown in the table by a

      variable of up to 0.15%, assuming constant assets. The management fee rate
      could be even higher or lower than this range, however, depending on asset
      fluctuations during the measuring period. Because a fee waiver will have a
     positive effect upon the Portfolio's performance, a fee waiver that is in
      place during the period when the performance adjustment applies may affect
      the performance adjustment in a way that is favorable to Janus Capital. It
    is possible that the cumulative dollar amount of additional compensation
     ultimately payable to Janus Capital may, under some circumstances, exceed
    the cumulative dollar amount of management fees waived by Janus Capital.
(5)   Management has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse        
   expenses to limit total annual operating expenses to 0.95% for Class II
until May 1, 2008.                                                  
(6)   Other Expenses have been restated to reflect new custodian, fund          
      administration and transfer agent fee schedules, as if these fee schedules
had been in effect for the previous fiscal year.                    
(7)   Other Expenses have been restated to reflect the current Met Investors    
Series Trust fee schedule, as if that schedule had applied to the   
Portfolio for the entire fiscal year.                               
(8)   The Management Fee has been restated to reflect an amended management fee 
 agreement, as if the agreement had been in effect during the previous
fiscal year.                                                        
(9)   The Portfolio's fiscal year end has been changed from 10/31 to 12/31. The 
  fees and expenses shown are for the Portfolio's last fiscal year ended
October 31, 2006.                                                   
(10)  Pursuant to an expense limitation agreement, the Investment Adviser has   
     agreed, for a period of one year commencing May 1, 2007, to limit its fee
      and to reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to limit total operating
   expenses to 1.30%, excluding 12b-1 fees. The fees and expenses shown in
      the table are annualized, based on the Portfolio's May 1, 2006 start date.
(11)  Pursuant to an expense limitation agreement, the Investment Adviser has   
     agreed, for a period of one year commencing May 1, 2007, to limit its fee
      and to reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to limit total operating
expenses to 1.00%, excluding 12b-1 fees.                            
(12)  Other Expenses have been restated to reflect current fees, as if current  
fees had been in effect for the previous fiscal year.               
(13)  MetLife Advisers, LLC has contractually agreed, for the period May 1, 2007
      through April 30, 2008, to reduce the Management Fee to the annual rate of
  0.345% for the first $500 million of the Portfolio's average daily net
assets and 0.335% for the next $500 million.                        
(14)  The Management Fee has been restated to reflect current fees, as if       
current fees had been in effect for the previous fiscal year.       
(15)  These Portfolios are "funds of funds" that invest substantially all of    
      their assets in other portfolios of the Met Investors Series Trust and the
 Metropolitan Series Fund, Inc. Because the Portfolios invest in other
     underlying portfolios, each Portfolio will also bear its pro rata portion
of the operating expenses of the underlying portfolios in which the 
    Portfolio invests, including the management fee. The weighted average of
the total operating expenses of the underlying portfolios, after any
 applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements, as of December 31,
2006, were: 0.61% for the MetLife Conservative Allocation Portfolio, 0.65%
    for the MetLife Conservative to Moderate Allocation Portfolio, 0.70% for
     the MetLife Moderate Allocation Portfolio, 0.75% for the MetLife Moderate
   to Aggressive Allocation Portfolio and 0.75% for the MetLife Aggressive
 Allocation Portfolio. The total operating expenses of the Portfolios,
 including the weighted average of the total operating expenses of the
underlying portfolios, before any applicable fee waivers and expense
reimbursements, as of December 31, 2006, were: 1.05% for the MetLife
    Conservative Allocation Portfolio, 1.02% for the MetLife Conservative to
    Moderate Allocation Portfolio, 1.07% for the MetLife Moderate Allocation
Portfolio, 1.11% for the MetLife Moderate to Aggressive Allocation  
Portfolio and 1.18% for the MetLife Aggressive Allocation Portfolio.
      Policy Owners may be able to realize lower aggregate expenses by investing
directly in the underlying portfolios instead of investing in the   
Portfolios. A Policy Owner who chooses to invest directly in the    
  underlying portfolios would not, however, receive the asset allocation
     services provided by MetLife Advisers LLC. (See the fund prospectus for a
description of each Portfolio's target allocation.)                 
(16)  MetLife Advisers, LLC has contractually agreed, for the period May 1, 2007
 through April 30, 2008, to waive fees or pay all expenses (other than
     brokerage costs, taxes, interest and any extraordinary expenses) so as to
limit net total annual operating expenses of the Portfolio to 0.10%,
excluding 12b-1 fees.                                               
(17)  MetLife Advisers, LLC has contractually agreed, for the period May 1, 2007
    through April 30, 2008, to reduce the Management Fee of the Portfolio to
0.243%.                                                             
(18)  Other Expenses include 0.02% of "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses," which  
    are fees and expenses attributable to underlying portfolios in which the
Portfolio invested during the preceding fiscal year.                
(19)  The Adviser has agreed to reduce its fees and reimburse The Merger Fund VL
     to the extent total annualized expenses exceed 1.40% of average daily net
assets. The agreement expires July 1, 2013.

 TRANSFERS OF CASH VALUE

Generally, you may transfer Cash Value among the Investment Options. Transfer   
requests received at our Home Office that are in good order before the close of 
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) will be processed according to the value(s)  
next computed following the close of business. Transfer requests received on a  
non-business day or after the close of the NYSE will be processed based on the  
value(s) next computed on the next business day.                                

MARKET TIMING/EXCESSIVE TRADING                                                 
THE POLICY IS INTENDED FOR USE AS A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT VEHICLE AND IS NOT     
DESIGNED TO SERVE AS A VEHICLE FOR EXCESSIVE TRADING OR MARKET TIMING IN AN     
ATTEMPT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE STOCK MARKET.       
Frequent requests from Policy Owners to transfer cash value may dilute the value
of a Fund's shares if the frequent trading involves an attempt to take advantage
of pricing inefficiencies created by a lag between a change in the value of the 
securities held by the Fund and the reflection of that change in the Fund's     
share price ("arbitrage trading"). Regardless of the existence of pricing       
inefficiencies, frequent transfers may also increase brokerage and              
administrative costs of the underlying Funds and may disrupt Fund management    
strategy, requiring a Fund to maintain a high cash position and possibly        
resulting in lost investment opportunities and forced liquidations ("disruptive 
trading"). Accordingly, arbitrage trading and disruptive trading activities     
(referred to collectively as "market timing") may adversely affect the long-term
performance of the Funds, which in turn adversely affect Policy Owners and other
persons who may have an interest in the Policies (e.g. beneficiaries).          

We have policies and procedures that attempt to detect and deter frequent       
transfers in situations where we determine there is a potential for arbitrage   
trading. Currently, we believe that such situations may be presented in the     
international, small-cap, and high-yield Funds (i.e. American Funds Global      
Growth Fund, Dreyfus Variable Investment Fund Developing Leaders Portfolio,     
Fidelity VIP High Income Portfolio, Franklin Small-Mid Cap Growth Securities    
Fund, Janus Aspen Global Technology Portfolio, Janus Aspen Worldwide Growth     
Portfolio, Legg Mason Partners Variable High Income Portfolio, Legg Mason       
Partners Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio, Lord Abbett Bond 
Debenture Portfolio, Met/AIM Small Cap Growth Portfolio, MFS(R) Emerging Markets
Equity Portfolio, MFS(R) Research International Portfolio, Oppenheimer Global   
Equity Portfolio, Pioneer Strategic Income Portfolio, Templeton Developing      
Markets Securities Fund, Templeton Foreign Securities Fund, Third Avenue Small  
Cap Value Portfolio, and Russell 2000(R) Index Portfolio -- the "Monitored      
Funds") and we monitor transfer activity in those Monitored Funds. In addition, 
as described below, we intend to treat all American Funds Insurance Series      
portfolios ("American Funds portfolios") as Monitored Portfolios. We employ     
various means to monitor transfer activity, such as examining the frequency and 
size of transfers into and out of the Monitored Funds within given periods of   
time. For example, we currently monitor transfer activity to determine if for   
each of the Monitored Funds, in a three-month period there were two or more     
"round-trips" of a certain dollar amount or greater. A round-trip is defined as 
a transfer in followed by a transfer out within the next 10 calendar days or a  
transfer out followed by a transfer in within the next 10 calendar days. In the 
case of a Policy that has been restricted previously, a single round-trip of a  
certain dollar amount or greater will trigger the transfer restrictions         
described below.                                                                

We do not believe that other Funds present a significant opportunity to engage  
in arbitrage trading and therefore do not monitor transfer activity in those    
Funds. We may change the Monitored Funds at any time without notice in our sole 
discretion. In addition to monitoring transfer activity in certain Funds, we    
rely on the underlying Funds to bring any potential disruptive trading activity 
they identify to our attention for investigation on a case-by-case basis. We    
will also investigate other harmful transfer activity that we identify from time
to time. We may revise these policies and procedures in our sole discretion at  
any time without prior notice.                                                  

AMERICAN FUNDS MONITORING POLICY. As a condition to making their portfolios     
available in our products, American Funds requires us to treat all American     
Funds Insurance Series portfolios ("American Funds portfolios") as Monitored    
Portfolios under our current market timing and excessive trading policies and   
procedures. Further, American Funds requires us to impose additional specified  
monitoring criteria for all American Funds portfolios available under the       
Policy, regardless of the potential for arbitrage trading. We are required to   
monitor transfer activity in American Funds portfolios to determine if there    
were two or more transfers in followed by transfers out, in each case of a      
certain dollar amount or greater, in any 30-day period. A first violation of the
American Funds monitoring policy will result in a written notice of violation;  
any additional violation will result in the imposition of the transfer          
restrictions described below. Also, as Monitored Portfolios, our current market 
timing and excessive trading policies and procedures also will apply to American
Funds portfolios, and transfer restrictions may be imposed upon a violation of  
either monitoring policy. Although we do not have the operational or systems    
capability at this time to impose the

American Funds monitoring policy and/or to treat all of the American Funds      
portfolios as Monitored Portfolios under our policy, we intend to do so in the  
future.                                                                         

Our policies and procedures may result in transfer restrictions being applied to
deter market timing. Currently, when we detect transfer activity in the         
Monitored Funds that exceeds our current transfer limits, or other transfer     
activity that we believe may be harmful to other Policy Owners or other persons 
who have an interest in the Policies, we will exercise our contractual right to 
revise, suspend or eliminate transfer privileges, including limiting the        
acceptable mode of requesting transfers, and thereafter will only accept        
transfer requests via regular U.S. mail and will reject transfer requests       
requested via facsimile, telephone or Internet. In addition, we also reserve the
right, but do not have the obligation, to further restrict the right to request 
transfers by any market timing firm or any other third party who has been       
authorized to initiate transfers on behalf of multiple Policy Owners. We may,   
among other things:                                                             

-  reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of    
attorney on behalf of more than one Policy Owner, or                  

 -  reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual owners who have
     executed pre-authorized transfer forms which are submitted by market timing
firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one Policy Owner. 

Transfers made under a Dollar Cost Averaging Program, a rebalancing program, or,
if applicable, any asset allocation program described in this prospectus are not
treated as a transfer when we evaluate trading patterns for market timing or    
excessive trading.                                                              

The detection and deterrence of harmful transfer activity involves judgments    
that are inherently subjective, such as the decision to monitor only those Funds
that we believe are susceptible to arbitrage trading or the determination of the
transfer limits. Our ability to detect and/or restrict such transfer activity   
may be limited by operational and technological systems, as well as our ability 
to predict strategies employed by Policy Owners to avoid such detection. Our    
ability to restrict such transfer activity also may be limited by provisions of 
the Policy. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will prevent all transfer
activity that may adversely affect Policy Owners and other persons with         
interests in the Policies. We do not accommodate market timing in any Fund and  
there are no arrangements in place to permit any policy owner to engage in      
market timing; we apply our policies and procedures without exception, waiver,  
or special arrangement.                                                         

The Funds may have adopted their own policies and procedures with respect to    
frequent purchases and redemptions of their respective shares and we reserve the
right to enforce these policies and procedures. For example, Funds may assess a 
redemption fee (which we reserve the right to collect) on shares held for a     
relatively short period. The prospectuses for the Funds describe any such       
policies and procedures, which may be more or less restrictive than the policies
and procedures we have adopted. Although we may not have the contractual        
authority or the operational capacity to apply the frequent trading policies and
procedures of the Funds, we have entered into a written agreement, as required  
by SEC regulation, with each Fund or its principal underwriter that obligates us
to provide to the Fund promptly upon request certain information about the      
trading activity of individual Policy Owners, and to execute instructions from  
the Fund to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by specific     
Owners who violate the frequent trading policies established by the Fund.       

In addition, Policy Owners and other persons with interests in the Policies     
should be aware that the purchase and redemption orders received by the Funds   
generally are "omnibus" orders from intermediaries, such as retirement plans or 
separate accounts funding variable insurance products. The omnibus orders       
reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual owners of
variable insurance products and/or individual retirement plan participants. The 
omnibus nature of these orders may limit the Funds in their ability to apply    
their frequent trading policies and procedures. In addition, the other insurance
companies and/or retirement plans may have different policies and procedures or 
may not have any such policies and procedures because of contractual            
limitations. For these reasons, we cannot guarantee that the Funds (and thus    
Policy Owners) will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to other        
insurance companies and/or retirement plans that may invest in the Funds. If a  
Fund believes that an omnibus order reflects one or more transfer requests from 
Policy Owners engaged in disruptive trading activity, the Fund may reject the   
entire omnibus order.                                                           

In accordance with applicable law, we reserve the right to modify or terminate  
the transfer privilege at any time. We also reserve the right to defer or       
restrict the transfer privilege at any time that we are unable to purchase or   
redeem shares as a result of any of the Funds, including any refusal or         
restriction on purchases or redemptions of their shares

as a result of their own policies and procedures on market timing activities    
(even if an entire omnibus order is rejected due to the market timing activity  
of a single policy owner. You should read the Fund prospectuses for more        
details.                                                                        

 SUSPENSION OF VALUATION AND POSTPONEMENT OF PAYMENT

We reserve the right to suspend valuation and postpone payment of any surrender,
partial surrender, policy loan, or death benefit proceeds that involves a       
determination of Cash Value in the Separate Account in any case whenever:       

(1)the New York Stock Exchange or any stock exchange in which a Fund invests
     is closed (except for customary weekend and holiday closings) or trading on
the New York Stock Exchange or other stock exchange is restricted as  
determined by the SEC or equivalent authority; or                     

(2)the SEC has determined that a state of emergency exists so that valuation
of the assets in a Fund or disposal of securities is not reasonably   
practicable.                                                          

Allocations and transfers to, and deductions and transfers from, a Fund may be  
postponed as described in (1) and (2) above. We reserve the right to suspend or 
postpone the date of any payment of any benefit or values (including the        
payments of cash surrenders and policy loans) for up to six months when Cash    
Value is being withdrawn from the Fixed Account.                                

We may withhold payment of surrender, withdrawal or loan proceeds if any portion
of those proceeds would be derived from a Policy Owner's check or pre-authorized
checking account deduction that has not yet cleared (i.e., that could still be  
dishonored by your banking institution). We may use telephone, fax, Internet or 
other means of communications to verify that payment from the Policy Owner's    
check has been or will be collected. We will not delay payment longer than      
necessary for us to verify that payment has been or will be collected. Policy   
Owners may avoid the possibility of delay in the disbursement of proceeds coming
from a check that has not yet cleared by providing us with a certified check. We
do not accept cash, money orders, or travelers checks.                          

 TRANSFER OF CASH VALUE FROM THE FIXED ACCOUNT TO THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS

You may only transfer amounts from the Fixed Account to any of the Investment   
Options twice each Policy Year. The amount of each transfer may not exceed the  
greater of: (a) $500 or (b) 12.5% of the Fixed Account value as of the date we  
receive your transfer request. We do not currently enforce these restrictions   
but reserve our right to do so in the future. The Fixed Account is not available
for transfers to the Investment Options through the Dollar Cost Averaging       
program. In addition, the Fixed Account is excluded from all Portfolio          
Rebalancing programs.                                                           

 TRANSFER OF CASH VALUE FROM THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS TO THE FIXED ACCOUNT

We reserve the right to limit or deny requests for transfers from any Investment
Option into the Fixed Account if, at the time we receive the request: (a) the   
Fixed Account value is greater than or equal to 30% of the Cash Value of your   
Policy or (b) the Fixed Account value would become greater than or equal to 30% 
of your Policy's Cash Value as a result of the requested transfer. We do not    
currently enforce these restrictions but reserve our right to do so in the      
future.

 THE FUNDS

The Funds offered through this Policy are listed below. Some Funds may not be   
available in certain states. Each Fund is registered under the Investment       
Company Act of 1940 as an open-end, management investment company. These Funds  
are not publicly traded and are offered only through variable annuity and       
variable life insurance products, and maybe in some instances, certain          
retirement plans. They are not the same retail mutual funds as those offered    
outside of a variable annuity or variable life insurance product, although the  
investment practices and fund names may be similar, and the portfolio managers  
may be identical. Accordingly, the performance of the retail mutual fund is     
likely to be different from that of the Fund.                                   

We select the Funds offered through this Policy based on several criteria,      
including asset class coverage, the strength of the adviser's or subadviser's   
reputation and tenure, brand recognition, performance, and the capability and   
qualification of each investment firm. Another factor we consider during the    
selection process is whether the Fund's adviser or subadviser is one of our     
affiliates or whether the Fund, its adviser, its subadviser(s), or an affiliate 
will make payments to us or our affiliates. In this regard, the profit          
distributions we receive from our affiliated investment advisers are a component
of the total revenue that we consider in configuring the features and investment
choices available in the variable insurance products that we and our affiliated 
insurance companies issue. Since we and our affiliated insurance companies may  
benefit more from the allocation of assets to portfolios advised by our         
affiliates than those that are not, we may be more inclined to offer portfolios 
advised by our affiliates in the variable insurance products we issue. For      
additional information on these arrangements, see "Payments We Receive." We     
review the Funds periodically and may remove a Fund or limit its availability to
new Premiums and/or transfers of Cash Value if we determine that the Fund no    
longer meets one or more of the selection criteria, and/or if the Fund has not  
attracted significant allocations from Policy owners. In some cases, we have    
included Funds based on recommendations made by broker-dealer firms.            

WE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INVESTMENT ADVICE AND DO NOT RECOMMEND OR ENDORSE ANY     
PARTICULAR FUND. YOU BEAR THE RISK OF ANY DECLINE IN THE CASH VALUE OF YOUR     
POLICY RESULTING FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNDS YOU HAVE CHOSEN.             

If investment in the Funds or a particular Fund is no longer possible, in our   
judgment becomes inappropriate for purposes of the Policy, or for any other     
reason in our sole discretion, we may substitute another Fund or Funds without  
your consent. The substituted Fund may have different fees and expenses.        
Substitution may be made with respect to existing investments or the investment 
of future Premiums, or both. However, we will not make such substitution without
any necessary approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable 
state insurance departments. Furthermore, we may close Funds to allocations of  
Premiums or Cash Value, or both, at any time in our sole discretion.            

In certain circumstances, the Company's ability to remove or replace a Fund may 
be limited by the terms of a five-year agreement between MetLife, Inc. (MetLife)
and Legg Mason, Inc. (Legg Mason) relating to the use of certain Funds advised  
by Legg Mason affiliates. The agreement sets forth the conditions under which   
the Company can remove a Fund, which, in some cases, may differ from the        
Company's own selection criteria. In addition, during the term of the agreement,
subject to the Company's fiduciary and other legal duties, the Company is       
generally obligated in the first instance to consider Funds advised by Legg     
Mason affiliates in seeking to make a substitution for a Fund advised by a Legg 
Mason affiliate. The agreement was originally entered into on July 1, 2005 by   
MetLife and certain affiliates of Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup) as part of         
MetLife's acquisition of The Travelers Insurance Company (now MetLife Insurance 
Company of Connecticut) and The Travelers Life and Annuity Company (now MetLife 
Life and Annuity Company of Connecticut) from Citigroup. Legg Mason replaced the
Citigroup affiliates as a party to the agreement when Citigroup sold its asset  
management business to Legg Mason. The agreement also obligates Legg Mason to   
continue making payments to us with respect to the Funds advised by Legg Mason  
affiliates, on the same terms provided for in administrative service agreements 
between Citigroup's asset management affiliates and the Travelers insurance     
companies that predated the acquisition.                                        

PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE. As described above, an investment adviser (other than our  
affiliates MetLife Advisers, LLC, and Met Investors Advisory LLC) or subadviser 
of a Fund, or its affiliates, may make payments to the Company and/or certain of
our affiliates. These payments may be used for a variety of purposes, including 
payment of expenses for certain administrative, marketing, and support services 
with respect to the Policies and, in the Company's role as an intermediary, with
respect to the Funds. The Company and its affiliates may profit from these      
payments. These payments may be derived, in whole or in part, from the advisory 
fee deducted from Fund assets. Policy Owners, through their indirect investment 
in the Funds, bear the costs of these advisory fees (see the Funds' prospectuses
for

more information). The amount of the payments we receive is based on a          
percentage of assets of the Funds attributable to the Policies and certain other
variable insurance products that the Company and its affiliates issue. These    
percentages differ and some advisers or subadvisers (or other affiliates) may   
pay the Company more than others. These percentages currently range up to .50%. 

Additionally, an investment adviser or subadviser of a Fund or its affiliates   
may provide the Company with wholesaling services that assist in the            
distribution of the Policies and may pay the Company and/or certain of our      
affiliates amounts to participate in sales meetings. These amounts may be       
significant and may provide the adviser or subadviser (or their affiliate) with 
increased access to persons involved in the distribution of the Policies.       

The Company and/or certain of its affiliated insurance companies have joint     
ownership interests in its affiliated investment advisers MetLife Advisers, LLC 
and Met Investors Advisory LLC, which are formed as "limited liability          
companies." The Company's ownership interests in MetLife Advisers, LLC and Met  
Investors Advisory LLC entitle us to profit distributions if the adviser makes a
profit with respect to the advisory fees it receives from the Fund. The Company 
will benefit accordingly from assets allocated to the Funds to the extent they  
result in profits to the advisers. (See "Fee Table -- Fund Fees and Expenses"   
for information on the management fees paid by the Funds and the Statement of   
Additional Information for the Funds for information on the management fees paid
by the advisers to the subadvisers.)                                            

Certain Funds have adopted a Distribution Plan under Rule 12b-1 of the          
Investment Company Act of 1940. A Fund's 12b-1 Plan, if any, is described in    
more detail in the Fund's prospectus. (See "Fee Table -- Fund Fees and Expenses"
and "Distribution & Compensation.") Any payments we receive pursuant to those   
12b-1 Plans are paid to us or our distributor. Payments under a Fund's 12b-1    
Plan decrease the Fund's investment return.                                     

We pay American Funds Distributors, Inc., principal underwriter for the American
Funds Insurance Series, a percentage of all premiums allocated to the American  
Funds Global Growth Fund, the American Funds Growth Fund and the American Funds 
Growth-Income Fund for services it provides in marketing the Fund's shares in   
connection with the Policy.                                                     

Each Fund has different investment objectives and risks. The Fund prospectuses  
contain more detailed information on each Fund's investment strategy, investment
advisers and its fees. YOU MAY OBTAIN A FUND PROSPECTUS BY CALLING 1-800-334-

of the Funds.

 FUND CHARGES AND EXPENSES

The next tables describe the Fund charges and expenses that you will indirectly 
pay periodically during the time that you own the Policy. The Investment Options
purchase shares of the Funds at net asset value. The net asset value already    
reflects the deduction of each Fund's Total Operating Expenses. Therefore you   
are indirectly bearing the costs of Fund expenses.                              

The first table below shows the minimum and maximum fees and expenses, as a     
percentage of average daily net assets, charged by any of the Funds as of       
December 31, 2006. The second table shows each Fund's fees and expenses, as a   
percentage of average daily net assets, as of December 31, 2006, unless         
otherwise noted. This information was provided by the Funds and we have not     
independently verified it. More detail concerning each Fund's fees and expenses 
is contained in the prospectus for each Fund.

++    Fees and expenses of this Fund are based on the Fund's fiscal year ended  
October 31, 2006.                                                   
(1)   Other Expenses include 0.02% of "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses," which  
    are fees and expenses attributable to underlying portfolios in which the
Portfolio invested during the preceding fiscal year.                
(2)   Other Expenses include 0.01% for the Franklin Small-Mid Cap Growth        
    Securities Fund, and 0.03% for the Templeton Foreign Securities Fund, of
"Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses," which are fees and expenses      
 attributable to underlying portfolios in which the Portfolio invested
  during the preceding fiscal year. The manager has agreed in advance to
   reduce its fee from assets invested by the Fund in a Franklin Templeton
    money market fund (the acquired fund) to the extent that the Fund's fees
 and expenses are due to those of the acquired fund. This reduction is
   required by the Trust's board of trustees and an exemptive order of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).                           
(3)   Other Expenses include 0.02% of "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses," which  
    are fees and expenses attributable to underlying portfolios in which the
Portfolio invested during the preceding fiscal year.                
(4)   The Portfolio pays an investment advisory fee rate that may adjust up or  
 down based upon the Portfolio's performance relative to its benchmark
    index during a measuring period. This fee rate, prior to any performance
    adjustment, is shown in the table above. Any such adjustment to this fee
    rate commenced February 2007 and may increase or decrease the management
fee rate shown in the table by a

      variable of up to 0.15%, assuming constant assets. The management fee rate
      could be even higher or lower than this range, however, depending on asset
      fluctuations during the measuring period. Because a fee waiver will have a
     positive effect upon the Portfolio's performance, a fee waiver that is in
      place during the period when the performance adjustment applies may affect
      the performance adjustment in a way that is favorable to Janus Capital. It
    is possible that the cumulative dollar amount of additional compensation
     ultimately payable to Janus Capital may, under some circumstances, exceed
    the cumulative dollar amount of management fees waived by Janus Capital.
(5)   Management has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse        
   expenses to limit total annual operating expenses to 0.95% for Class II
until May 1, 2008.                                                  
(6)   Other Expenses have been restated to reflect new custodian, fund          
      administration and transfer agent fee schedules, as if these fee schedules
had been in effect for the previous fiscal year.                    
(7)   Other Expenses have been restated to reflect the current Met Investors    
Series Trust fee schedule, as if that schedule had applied to the   
Portfolio for the entire fiscal year.                               
(8)   The Management Fee has been restated to reflect an amended management fee 
 agreement, as if the agreement had been in effect during the previous
fiscal year.                                                        
(9)   The Portfolio's fiscal year end has been changed from 10/31 to 12/31. The 
  fees and expenses shown are for the Portfolio's last fiscal year ended
October 31, 2006.                                                   
(10)  Pursuant to an expense limitation agreement, the Investment Adviser has   
     agreed, for a period of one year commencing May 1, 2007, to limit its fee
      and to reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to limit total operating
   expenses to 1.30%, excluding 12b-1 fees. The fees and expenses shown in
      the table are annualized, based on the Portfolio's May 1, 2006 start date.
(11)  Pursuant to an expense limitation agreement, the Investment Adviser has   
     agreed, for a period of one year commencing May 1, 2007, to limit its fee
      and to reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to limit total operating
expenses to 1.00%, excluding 12b-1 fees.                            
(12)  Other Expenses have been restated to reflect current fees, as if current  
fees had been in effect for the previous fiscal year.               
(13)  MetLife Advisers, LLC has contractually agreed, for the period May 1, 2007
      through April 30, 2008, to reduce the Management Fee to the annual rate of
  0.345% for the first $500 million of the Portfolio's average daily net
assets and 0.335% for the next $500 million.                        
(14)  The Management Fee has been restated to reflect current fees, as if       
current fees had been in effect for the previous fiscal year.       
(15)  These Portfolios are "funds of funds" that invest substantially all of    
      their assets in other portfolios of the Met Investors Series Trust and the
 Metropolitan Series Fund, Inc. Because the Portfolios invest in other
     underlying portfolios, each Portfolio will also bear its pro rata portion
of the operating expenses of the underlying portfolios in which the 
    Portfolio invests, including the management fee. The weighted average of
the total operating expenses of the underlying portfolios, after any
 applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements, as of December 31,
2006, were: 0.61% for the MetLife Conservative Allocation Portfolio, 0.65%
    for the MetLife Conservative to Moderate Allocation Portfolio, 0.70% for
     the MetLife Moderate Allocation Portfolio, 0.75% for the MetLife Moderate
   to Aggressive Allocation Portfolio and 0.75% for the MetLife Aggressive
 Allocation Portfolio. The total operating expenses of the Portfolios,
 including the weighted average of the total operating expenses of the
underlying portfolios, before any applicable fee waivers and expense
reimbursements, as of December 31, 2006, were: 1.05% for the MetLife
    Conservative Allocation Portfolio, 1.02% for the MetLife Conservative to
    Moderate Allocation Portfolio, 1.07% for the MetLife Moderate Allocation
Portfolio, 1.11% for the MetLife Moderate to Aggressive Allocation  
Portfolio and 1.18% for the MetLife Aggressive Allocation Portfolio.
      Policy Owners may be able to realize lower aggregate expenses by investing
directly in the underlying portfolios instead of investing in the   
Portfolios. A Policy Owner who chooses to invest directly in the    
  underlying portfolios would not, however, receive the asset allocation
     services provided by MetLife Advisers LLC. (See the fund prospectus for a
description of each Portfolio's target allocation.)                 
(16)  MetLife Advisers, LLC has contractually agreed, for the period May 1, 2007
 through April 30, 2008, to waive fees or pay all expenses (other than
     brokerage costs, taxes, interest and any extraordinary expenses) so as to
limit net total annual operating expenses of the Portfolio to 0.10%,
excluding 12b-1 fees.                                               
(17)  MetLife Advisers, LLC has contractually agreed, for the period May 1, 2007
    through April 30, 2008, to reduce the Management Fee of the Portfolio to
0.243%.                                                             
(18)  Other Expenses include 0.02% of "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses," which  
    are fees and expenses attributable to underlying portfolios in which the
Portfolio invested during the preceding fiscal year.                
(19)  The Adviser has agreed to reduce its fees and reimburse The Merger Fund VL
     to the extent total annualized expenses exceed 1.40% of average daily net
assets. The agreement expires July 1, 2013.

 TRANSFERS OF CASH VALUE

Generally, you may transfer Cash Value among the Investment Options. Transfer   
requests received at our Home Office that are in good order before the close of 
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) will be processed according to the value(s)  
next computed following the close of business. Transfer requests received on a  
non-business day or after the close of the NYSE will be processed based on the  
value(s) next computed on the next business day.                                

MARKET TIMING/EXCESSIVE TRADING                                                 
THE POLICY IS INTENDED FOR USE AS A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT VEHICLE AND IS NOT     
DESIGNED TO SERVE AS A VEHICLE FOR EXCESSIVE TRADING OR MARKET TIMING IN AN     
ATTEMPT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE STOCK MARKET.       
Frequent requests from Policy Owners to transfer cash value may dilute the value
of a Fund's shares if the frequent trading involves an attempt to take advantage
of pricing inefficiencies created by a lag between a change in the value of the 
securities held by the Fund and the reflection of that change in the Fund's     
share price ("arbitrage trading"). Regardless of the existence of pricing       
inefficiencies, frequent transfers may also increase brokerage and              
administrative costs of the underlying Funds and may disrupt Fund management    
strategy, requiring a Fund to maintain a high cash position and possibly        
resulting in lost investment opportunities and forced liquidations ("disruptive 
trading"). Accordingly, arbitrage trading and disruptive trading activities     
(referred to collectively as "market timing") may adversely affect the long-term
performance of the Funds, which in turn adversely affect Policy Owners and other
persons who may have an interest in the Policies (e.g. beneficiaries).          

We have policies and procedures that attempt to detect and deter frequent       
transfers in situations where we determine there is a potential for arbitrage   
trading. Currently, we believe that such situations may be presented in the     
international, small-cap, and high-yield Funds (i.e. American Funds Global      
Growth Fund, Dreyfus Variable Investment Fund Developing Leaders Portfolio,     
Fidelity VIP High Income Portfolio, Franklin Small-Mid Cap Growth Securities    
Fund, Janus Aspen Global Technology Portfolio, Janus Aspen Worldwide Growth     
Portfolio, Legg Mason Partners Variable High Income Portfolio, Legg Mason       
Partners Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio, Lord Abbett Bond 
Debenture Portfolio, Met/AIM Small Cap Growth Portfolio, MFS(R) Emerging Markets
Equity Portfolio, MFS(R) Research International Portfolio, Oppenheimer Global   
Equity Portfolio, Pioneer Strategic Income Portfolio, Templeton Developing      
Markets Securities Fund, Templeton Foreign Securities Fund, Third Avenue Small  
Cap Value Portfolio, and Russell 2000(R) Index Portfolio -- the "Monitored      
Funds") and we monitor transfer activity in those Monitored Funds. In addition, 
as described below, we intend to treat all American Funds Insurance Series      
portfolios ("American Funds portfolios") as Monitored Portfolios. We employ     
various means to monitor transfer activity, such as examining the frequency and 
size of transfers into and out of the Monitored Funds within given periods of   
time. For example, we currently monitor transfer activity to determine if for   
each of the Monitored Funds, in a three-month period there were two or more     
"round-trips" of a certain dollar amount or greater. A round-trip is defined as 
a transfer in followed by a transfer out within the next 10 calendar days or a  
transfer out followed by a transfer in within the next 10 calendar days. In the 
case of a Policy that has been restricted previously, a single round-trip of a  
certain dollar amount or greater will trigger the transfer restrictions         
described below.                                                                

We do not believe that other Funds present a significant opportunity to engage  
in arbitrage trading and therefore do not monitor transfer activity in those    
Funds. We may change the Monitored Funds at any time without notice in our sole 
discretion. In addition to monitoring transfer activity in certain Funds, we    
rely on the underlying Funds to bring any potential disruptive trading activity 
they identify to our attention for investigation on a case-by-case basis. We    
will also investigate other harmful transfer activity that we identify from time
to time. We may revise these policies and procedures in our sole discretion at  
any time without prior notice.                                                  

AMERICAN FUNDS MONITORING POLICY. As a condition to making their portfolios     
available in our products, American Funds requires us to treat all American     
Funds Insurance Series portfolios ("American Funds portfolios") as Monitored    
Portfolios under our current market timing and excessive trading policies and   
procedures. Further, American Funds requires us to impose additional specified  
monitoring criteria for all American Funds portfolios available under the       
Policy, regardless of the potential for arbitrage trading. We are required to   
monitor transfer activity in American Funds portfolios to determine if there    
were two or more transfers in followed by transfers out, in each case of a      
certain dollar amount or greater, in any 30-day period. A first violation of the
American Funds monitoring policy will result in a written notice of violation;  
any additional violation will result in the imposition of the transfer          
restrictions described below. Also, as Monitored Portfolios, our current market 
timing and excessive trading policies and procedures also will apply to American
Funds portfolios, and transfer restrictions may be imposed upon a violation of  
either monitoring policy. Although we do not have the operational or systems    
capability at this time to impose the

American Funds monitoring policy and/or to treat all of the American Funds      
portfolios as Monitored Portfolios under our policy, we intend to do so in the  
future.                                                                         

Our policies and procedures may result in transfer restrictions being applied to
deter market timing. Currently, when we detect transfer activity in the         
Monitored Funds that exceeds our current transfer limits, or other transfer     
activity that we believe may be harmful to other Policy Owners or other persons 
who have an interest in the Policies, we will exercise our contractual right to 
revise, suspend or eliminate transfer privileges, including limiting the        
acceptable mode of requesting transfers, and thereafter will only accept        
transfer requests via regular U.S. mail and will reject transfer requests       
requested via facsimile, telephone or Internet. In addition, we also reserve the
right, but do not have the obligation, to further restrict the right to request 
transfers by any market timing firm or any other third party who has been       
authorized to initiate transfers on behalf of multiple Policy Owners. We may,   
among other things:                                                             

-  reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of    
attorney on behalf of more than one Policy Owner, or                  

 -  reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual owners who have
     executed pre-authorized transfer forms which are submitted by market timing
firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one Policy Owner. 

Transfers made under a Dollar Cost Averaging Program, a rebalancing program, or,
if applicable, any asset allocation program described in this prospectus are not
treated as a transfer when we evaluate trading patterns for market timing or    
excessive trading.                                                              

The detection and deterrence of harmful transfer activity involves judgments    
that are inherently subjective, such as the decision to monitor only those Funds
that we believe are susceptible to arbitrage trading or the determination of the
transfer limits. Our ability to detect and/or restrict such transfer activity   
may be limited by operational and technological systems, as well as our ability 
to predict strategies employed by Policy Owners to avoid such detection. Our    
ability to restrict such transfer activity also may be limited by provisions of 
the Policy. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will prevent all transfer
activity that may adversely affect Policy Owners and other persons with         
interests in the Policies. We do not accommodate market timing in any Fund and  
there are no arrangements in place to permit any policy owner to engage in      
market timing; we apply our policies and procedures without exception, waiver,  
or special arrangement.                                                         

The Funds may have adopted their own policies and procedures with respect to    
frequent purchases and redemptions of their respective shares and we reserve the
right to enforce these policies and procedures. For example, Funds may assess a 
redemption fee (which we reserve the right to collect) on shares held for a     
relatively short period. The prospectuses for the Funds describe any such       
policies and procedures, which may be more or less restrictive than the policies
and procedures we have adopted. Although we may not have the contractual        
authority or the operational capacity to apply the frequent trading policies and
procedures of the Funds, we have entered into a written agreement, as required  
by SEC regulation, with each Fund or its principal underwriter that obligates us
to provide to the Fund promptly upon request certain information about the      
trading activity of individual Policy Owners, and to execute instructions from  
the Fund to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by specific     
Owners who violate the frequent trading policies established by the Fund.       

In addition, Policy Owners and other persons with interests in the Policies     
should be aware that the purchase and redemption orders received by the Funds   
generally are "omnibus" orders from intermediaries, such as retirement plans or 
separate accounts funding variable insurance products. The omnibus orders       
reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual owners of
variable insurance products and/or individual retirement plan participants. The 
omnibus nature of these orders may limit the Funds in their ability to apply    
their frequent trading policies and procedures. In addition, the other insurance
companies and/or retirement plans may have different policies and procedures or 
may not have any such policies and procedures because of contractual            
limitations. For these reasons, we cannot guarantee that the Funds (and thus    
Policy Owners) will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to other        
insurance companies and/or retirement plans that may invest in the Funds. If a  
Fund believes that an omnibus order reflects one or more transfer requests from 
Policy Owners engaged in disruptive trading activity, the Fund may reject the   
entire omnibus order.                                                           

In accordance with applicable law, we reserve the right to modify or terminate  
the transfer privilege at any time. We also reserve the right to defer or       
restrict the transfer privilege at any time that we are unable to purchase or   
redeem shares as a result of any of the Funds, including any refusal or         
restriction on purchases or redemptions of their shares

as a result of their own policies and procedures on market timing activities    
(even if an entire omnibus order is rejected due to the market timing activity  
of a single policy owner. You should read the Fund prospectuses for more        
details.                                                                        

 SUSPENSION OF VALUATION AND POSTPONEMENT OF PAYMENT

We reserve the right to suspend valuation and postpone payment of any surrender,
partial surrender, policy loan, or death benefit proceeds that involves a       
determination of Cash Value in the Separate Account in any case whenever:       

(1)the New York Stock Exchange or any stock exchange in which a Fund invests
     is closed (except for customary weekend and holiday closings) or trading on
the New York Stock Exchange or other stock exchange is restricted as  
determined by the SEC or equivalent authority; or                     

(2)the SEC has determined that a state of emergency exists so that valuation
of the assets in a Fund or disposal of securities is not reasonably   
practicable.                                                          

Allocations and transfers to, and deductions and transfers from, a Fund may be  
postponed as described in (1) and (2) above. We reserve the right to suspend or 
postpone the date of any payment of any benefit or values (including the        
payments of cash surrenders and policy loans) for up to six months when Cash    
Value is being withdrawn from the Fixed Account.                                

We may withhold payment of surrender, withdrawal or loan proceeds if any portion
of those proceeds would be derived from a Policy Owner's check or pre-authorized
checking account deduction that has not yet cleared (i.e., that could still be  
dishonored by your banking institution). We may use telephone, fax, Internet or 
other means of communications to verify that payment from the Policy Owner's    
check has been or will be collected. We will not delay payment longer than      
necessary for us to verify that payment has been or will be collected. Policy   
Owners may avoid the possibility of delay in the disbursement of proceeds coming
from a check that has not yet cleared by providing us with a certified check. We
do not accept cash, money orders, or travelers checks.                          

 TRANSFER OF CASH VALUE FROM THE FIXED ACCOUNT TO THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS

You may only transfer amounts from the Fixed Account to any of the Investment   
Options twice each Policy Year. The amount of each transfer may not exceed the  
greater of: (a) $500 or (b) 12.5% of the Fixed Account value as of the date we  
receive your transfer request. We do not currently enforce these restrictions   
but reserve our right to do so in the future. The Fixed Account is not available
for transfers to the Investment Options through the Dollar Cost Averaging       
program. In addition, the Fixed Account is excluded from all Portfolio          
Rebalancing programs.                                                           

 TRANSFER OF CASH VALUE FROM THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS TO THE FIXED ACCOUNT

We reserve the right to limit or deny requests for transfers from any Investment
Option into the Fixed Account if, at the time we receive the request: (a) the   
Fixed Account value is greater than or equal to 30% of the Cash Value of your   
Policy or (b) the Fixed Account value would become greater than or equal to 30% 
of your Policy's Cash Value as a result of the requested transfer. We do not    
currently enforce these restrictions but reserve our right to do so in the      
future.

14. As a result of the substitutions, the number of investment options offered under substantially all of the Contracts will not change (currently ranges in number from 12 to 121). For the limited number of Contracts that will experience a reduction in the number of available investment options, no contract will ever be reduced by more than 2 investment options after the substitutions.
15. Those substitutions which replace investment options advised by investment advisers that are not Start Printed Page 404affiliated with the Substitution Applicants with funds for which MetLife Advisers, LLC acts as investment adviser will permit each adviser, under the Multi-Manager Order, [IC-22824 (1997) and IC-23859 (1999)], to hire, monitor and replace sub-advisers as necessary to achieve optimal performance.
16. Contract owners with sub-account balances invested (through the separate account) in shares of the Replacement Funds, except for the Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio substitution, will have the same or lower total expense ratios taking into account fund expenses and current fee waivers.
17. In the following substitutions, the management fee and/or applicable Rule 12b-1 fee of the Replacement Fund are either currently higher, or, at certain management fee breakpoints, may be higher than those of the respective Existing Fund: Delaware VIP Small Cap Value Series/Third Avenue Small Cap Value Portfolio; Janus Aspen Global Technology Portfolio/RCM Technology Portfolio; Legg Mason Global Currents Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio/MFS Research International Portfolio; Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic Income Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio; Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio; Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund Portfolio; Templeton Growth Fund, Inc./Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio; and Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio.
18. The Substitution Applicants propose to limit Contract charges attributable to Contract value invested in the Replacement Funds following the proposed substitutions to a rate that would offset the difference in the expense ratio between each Existing Fund's net expense ratio and the net expense ratio for the respective Replacement Fund.
19. Except for the Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio substitution where there is an increase in net expenses after waivers of 0.01% and the Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund Portfolio where there is no increase or decrease in net expense ratios, after waivers, the substitutions will result in decreased net expense ratios, after waivers, ranging from 1 basis point to 24 basis points. Moreover, there will be no increase in Contract fees and expenses, including mortality and expense risk fees and administration and distribution fees charged to the Separate Accounts as a result of the substitutions.
20. The Substitution Applicants believe that the Replacement Funds have investment objectives, policies and risk profiles, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially the same as, or sufficiently similar to, the corresponding Existing Funds to make those Replacement Funds appropriate candidates as substitutes.
21. In addition, after the substitutions, neither MetLife Advisers, LLC nor any of their affiliates will receive compensation from the charges to the Separate Accounts related to the Contracts or from Rule 12b-1 fees or revenue sharing from the Replacement Funds in excess of the compensation currently received from the investment advisers or distributors of the Existing Funds.
22. The share classes of the Replacement Funds are either identical to or less than the share classes of the Existing Funds with respect to the imposition of Rule 12b-1 fees currently imposed, except with respect to the substitution of MFS Research International Portfolio (Class B shares—0.25%) for Legg Mason Global Currents Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio (single share class—0%); Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio (Class B shares—0.25%) for Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic Income Portfolio (single share class—0%); Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio (Class B shares—0.25%) for Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio (Class I—0%).
23. Each MIST and Met Series Fund Replacement Fund's Class B shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be raised to 0.50%, each MIST Replacement Fund's Class E shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be raised to 0.25% and each Met Series Fund Replacement Fund's Class E shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be raised to 0.50% of net assets by the Replacement Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees without shareholder approval. However, Met Series Fund and MIST represent that Rule 12b-1 fees of the Class B and Class E shares of the Replacement Funds issued in connection with the proposed substitutions will not be raised above the current rate without approval of a majority in interest of the respective Replacement Funds' shareholders after the substitutions.
24. The distributors of the Existing Funds pay to the Insurance Companies, or their affiliates, any 12b-1 fees associated with the class of shares sold to the Separate Accounts. Similarly, the distributors for MIST and Met Series Fund will receive from the applicable class of shares held by the Separate Accounts Rule 12b-1 fees in the same amount or a lesser amount than the amount paid by the Existing Funds, except as described above.
25. Further, in addition to any Rule 12b-1 fees, the investment advisers or distributors of the Existing Funds pay the Insurance Companies or one of their affiliates from 0 to 50 basis points for the Existing Funds' classes of shares involved in the substitutions. Following the substitutions, these payments will not be made on behalf of the Replacement Funds. Rather, the Insurance Companies or their affiliates will have available both the 25 and 15 basis points in Rule 12b-1 fees from the Replacement Funds (with respect to Class B and Class E shares, respectively) and, as owners of the Replacement Funds' adviser, profit distributions from the adviser. These profits from investment advisory fees may be more or less than the fees being paid by the Existing Funds.
Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions
1. The Substitution Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the proposed substitutions.
2. Applicants represent that the Contracts permit the applicable Insurance Company, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a sub-account of the Separate Accounts. The prospectuses for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right.
3. By a supplement to the prospectuses for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts, each Insurance Company has notified all owners of the Contracts of its intention to take the necessary actions, including seeking the order requested by this Application, to substitute shares of the funds as described herein. The supplement has advised Contract owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed substitution, owners are permitted to make one transfer of Contract value (or annuity unit exchange) out of the Existing Fund sub-account to one or more other sub-accounts without the transfer (or exchange) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge. The Start Printed Page 405supplement also has informed Contract owners that the Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved under any Contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed substitutions. The supplement has also advised Contract owners that for at least 30 days following the proposed substitutions, the Insurance Companies will permit Contract owners affected by the substitutions to make one transfer of Contract value (or annuity unit exchange) out of the Replacement Fund sub-account to one or more other sub-accounts without the transfer (or exchange) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge.
4. The proposed substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's Contract value, cash value, or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts.
5. The process for accomplishing the transfer of assets from each Existing Fund to its corresponding Replacement Fund will be determined on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of an Existing Fund for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the Replacement Fund. In certain other cases, it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming the shares of an Existing Fund in-kind; those assets will then be contributed in-kind to the corresponding Replacement Fund to purchase shares of that Fund. All in-kind redemptions from an Existing Fund of which any of the Substitution Applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Commission's no-action letter issued to Signature Financial Group, Inc. (available December 28, 1999).
6. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions, nor will their rights or an Insurance Company's obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. All expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitutions, including brokerage, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses, will be paid by the Insurance Companies. In addition, the proposed substitutions will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners. The proposed substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing Contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions. No fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitutions, because the proposed substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a Contract year.
7. In addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to owners of Contracts, within five business days after the proposed substitutions are completed, Contract owners will be sent a written notice informing them that the substitutions were carried out and that they may make one transfer of all Contract value or cash value under a Contract invested in any one of the sub-accounts on the date of the notice to one or more other sub-accounts available under their Contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among sub-accounts or from the variable account options to the fixed account options. The notice will also reiterate that (other than with respect to “market timing” activity) the Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed substitutions. The Insurance Companies will also send each Contract owner current prospectuses for the Replacement Funds involved to the extent that they have not previously received a copy.
8. Each Insurance Company also is seeking approval of the proposed substitutions from any State insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate.
9. The Substitution Applicants agree that for those who were Contract owners on the date of the proposed substitutions, the Insurance Companies will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four months following the date of the proposed substitutions, those Contract owners whose sub-account invests in the Replacement Fund such that the sum of the Replacement Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and sub-account expenses (asset-based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Existing Fund's net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and sub-account expenses for fiscal year 2009, except with respect to the Delaware VIP Small Cap Value Series/Third Avenue Small Cap Value Portfolio, Janus Aspen Global Technology Portfolio/RCM Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason Global Currents Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio/MFS Research International Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic Income Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund Portfolio, Templeton Growth Fund, Inc./Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio, and Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio substitutions.
10. With respect to the Delaware VIP Small Cap Value Series/Third Avenue Small Cap Value Portfolio, Janus Aspen Global Technology Portfolio/RCM Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason Global Currents Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio/MFS Research International Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic Income Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund Portfolio substitutions, Templeton Growth Fund, Inc./Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio, and Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio substitutions, the reimbursement agreement with respect to the Replacement Fund's operating expenses and sub-account expenses, will extend for the life of each Contract outstanding on the date of the proposed substitutions.
11. The Substitution Applicants further agree that, except with respect to the Delaware VIP Small Cap Value Series/Third Avenue Small Cap Value Portfolio, Janus Aspen Global Technology Portfolio/RCM Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason Global Currents Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio/MFS Research International Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic Income Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, Start Printed Page 406Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund Portfolio, Templeton Growth Fund, Inc./Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio and Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio substitutions, the Insurance Companies will not increase total separate account charges (net of any reimbursements or waivers) for any existing owner of the Contracts on the date of the substitutions for a period of two years from the date of the substitutions.
12. With respect to the Delaware VIP Small Cap Value Series/Third Avenue Small Cap Value Portfolio, Janus Aspen Global Technology Portfolio/RCM Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason Global Currents Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio/MFS Research International Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic Income Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund Portfolio, Templeton Growth Fund, Inc./Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio, and Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio substitutions, the agreement not to increase the separate account charges will extend for the life of each Contract outstanding on the date of the proposed substitutions.
13. In each case, the applicable Insurance Companies believe that it is in the best interests of the Contract owners to substitute the Replacement Fund for the Existing Fund. The Insurance Companies believe that in cases where the Replacement Fund has a new sub-adviser, the new sub-adviser will, over the long term, be positioned to provide at least comparable performance to that of the Existing Fund's sub-adviser.
14. The Substitution Applicants anticipate that Contract owners will be better off with the array of sub-accounts offered after the proposed substitutions than they have been with the array of sub-accounts offered prior to the substitutions.
15. The Substitution Applicants submit that none of the proposed substitutions is of the type that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent.
16. The Substitution Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the proposed substitutions by the Insurance Companies.
17. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit the Insurance Companies to carry out each of the proposed substitutions.
18. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company.
19. Because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company, the Insurance Companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially all of the shares of MIST and Met Series Fund. Therefore, MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are arguably under the control of the Insurance Companies notwithstanding the fact that Contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the Separate Accounts. If MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are under the control of the Insurance Companies, then each Insurance Company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds. If MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are under the control of the Insurance Companies, then MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are affiliated persons of the Insurance Companies.
20. Regardless of whether or not the Insurance Companies can be considered to control MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds, because the Insurance Companies own of record more than 5% of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each Replacement Fund's investment adviser, the Insurance Companies are affiliated persons of both MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds. Likewise, their respective funds are each an affiliated person of the Insurance Companies.
21. The Insurance Companies, through their separate accounts in the aggregate own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the following Existing Funds: Janus Aspen Global Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason Clearbridge Variable Capital Portfolio, Legg Mason Global Currents Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic Income Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio, Pioneer Bond VCT Portfolio and Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio. Therefore, each Insurance Company is an affiliated person of those funds.
22. Because the substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and purchases, the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons. The proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing Funds to the Insurance Companies; immediately thereafter, the Insurance Companies would purchase shares of the Replacement Funds with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Funds. Accordingly, as the Insurance Companies and certain of the Existing Funds listed above, and the Insurance Companies and the Replacement Funds, could be viewed as affiliated persons of one another under Section 2(a)(3) of the Act, it is conceivable that this aspect of the substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a).
23. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: (a) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the Act; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
24. The Section 17 Applicants submit that for all the reasons stated above the terms of the proposed in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Funds by the Insurance Companies, including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in this Application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Insurance Companies are consistent with the policies of: (a) MIST and of its Third Avenue Small Cap Value, RCM Technology, Met/Templeton Growth, MFS Research International, PIMCO Total Return, and Pioneer Fund Portfolios; and (b) Met Series Fund and of its Davis Venture Value, Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities and Van Eck Global Natural Resources Portfolios, Start Printed Page 407as recited in the current registration statements and reports filed by each under the Act. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
25. To the extent that the in-kind purchases by the Insurance Company of the Replacement Funds' shares are deemed to involve principal transactions among affiliated persons, the procedures described below should be sufficient to assure that the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair to all participants. The Section 17 Applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchase transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received by each fund involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the Separate Accounts. Contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the substitutions. Even though the Separate Accounts, the Insurance Companies, MIST and Met Series Fund may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the Rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons. In addition, as stated above, the in-kind redemptions will only be made in accordance with the conditions set out in the Signature Financial Group no-action letter (December 29, 1999).
26. The boards of MIST and Met Series Fund have adopted procedures, as required by paragraph (e)(1) of Rule 17a-7, pursuant to which the series of each may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates. The Section 17 Applicants will carry out the proposed Insurance Company in-kind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and each series' procedures thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Nevertheless, the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each Replacement Fund from overreaching that Rule 17a-7 provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that Rule in the ordinary course of their business. In particular, the Insurance Companies (or any of their affiliates) cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the Replacement Funds. Although the transactions may not be entirely for cash, each will be effected based upon (1) the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-7, and (2) the net asset value per share of each fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective investment company registration statement and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the Act. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed in kind purchase transactions.
27. The sale of shares of Replacement Funds for investment securities, as contemplated by the proposed Insurance Company in-kind purchases, is consistent with the investment policies and restrictions of the Investment Companies and the Replacement Funds because (a) the shares are sold at their net asset value, and (b) the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the Replacement Funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash. To assure that the second of these conditions is met, MetLife Advisers, LLC and the sub-adviser, as applicable, will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each Replacement Fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction.
28. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Insurance Company in-kind purchases are consistent with the general purposes of the Act as stated in the Findings and Declaration of Policy in Section 1 of the Act and that the proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the Act was designed to prevent.
29. The Section 17 Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the Act exempting the Separate Accounts, the Insurance Companies, MIST, Met Series Fund and each Replacement Fund from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Insurance Companies on behalf of the Separate Accounts to carry out, as part of the substitutions, the in-kind purchase of shares of the Replacement Funds which may be deemed to be prohibited by Section 17(a) of the Act.
Conclusion
Applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the Act and are consistent with the standards of Section 17(b) of the Act and that the requested orders should be granted.

4. Separate Account CPPVUL1 serves as a separate account funding vehicle for certain Contracts that are exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D thereunder.
5. Although Separate Account QPN and Separate Account CPPVUL1 are exempt from registration under the Act, they would be subject to the investment limitations of Section 12 but for the exclusion contained in Section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act. To rely on such exclusion, an investment company that is not a registered investment company must, among other things, agree to refrain from substituting a security unless the Commission approves the substitution in the manner provided in Section 26 of the Act.
6. MIST and Met Series Fund are each registered under the Act as open-end management investment companies of the series type, and their securities are registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

7. MetLife Investors Distribution Company, an affiliate of the Insurance Companies, is the distributor of the Contracts and serves as the principal underwriter of MIST and Met Series Fund.
8. The Contracts permit the applicable Insurance Company, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a sub-account of the Separate Accounts. The prospectuses for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts contain appropriate disclosures of this right. File numbers for the Contracts, the Separate Accounts and the Investment Companies are included in the application.
9. Each Insurance Company, on its behalf and on behalf of the Separate Accounts proposes to make certain substitutions of shares of 13 funds (the “Existing Funds”) held in sub-accounts of its respective Separate Accounts into certain series of MIST and Met Series Fund (the “Replacement Funds”).
The Substitution Applicants request an order from the Commission pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitutions of shares of the following series of the Trust, the Replacement Funds, for shares of the corresponding third party, unaffiliated underlying mutual funds, the Existing Funds, as shown in the following table:

11. MetLife Advisers, LLC is the investment adviser of each of the Replacement Funds.
12. The Substitution Applicants believe the Substitutions will provide significant benefits to Contract owners, including improved selection of sub-advisers and simplification of fund offerings through the elimination of overlapping offerings.
13. Based on generally better performance records and lower total expenses of the Replacement Funds, the Substitution Applicants believe that the sub-advisers to the Replacement Funds overall may provide more consistent performance for their Funds than the advisers or sub-advisers of the Existing Funds (other than those advisers or sub-advisers that manage both the Existing Fund and the Replacement Fund). At the same time, Applicants assert that Contract owners will continue to be able to select among a similar number of investment options, with a similar range of investment objectives, investment strategies, and managers.
14. As a result of the Substitutions, the number of investment options offered under the Contracts may change slightly. That number, which currently ranges from three to 122, will range from three to 120 following the Substitutions. For the Contracts that will experience a reduction in the number of available investment options, the Applicants assert that none will be reduced by more than two investment options and all will have at least 15 available investment options after the Substitutions. With respect to products with fewer than 20 open investment options, only one product's investment options will be reduced, moving from 16 to 15 investment options.
15. The Substitutions will replace investment options advised by investment advisers that are not affiliated with the Substitution Applicants with funds for which MetLife Advisers, LLC acts as investment adviser, which will permit MetLife Advisers, LLC, under the exemptive orders issued to New England Funds Trust I, et al., Inv. Co. Rel. No. 22824 (1997) (order), Inv. Co. Release No. 23859 (1999) (amended order) (the “Multi-Manager Order”) to enter into and amend sub-advisory agreements without shareholder approval under certain conditions to hire, monitor and replace sub-advisers as necessary to achieve optimal performance. Met Series Fund and MIST have been subject to the Multi-Manager Order since 1999 and 2000, respectively.
16. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, except for the DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio and Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio, the management fees of the Replacement Funds are the same or lower than that of the respective Existing Fund. With respect to the DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio substitution, the net expenses (after waivers) of Jennison Growth Portfolio were 0.01% lower than those of DWS Capital Growth VIP. With respect to the Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio substitution, the total expenses (before waivers) and net expenses (after waivers) of Invesco Comstock Portfolio were lower than those of Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund.
17. The Applicants assert the Substitutions will result in decreased net expense ratios, after waivers, ranging from 0.01% to 0.66%. Moreover, there will be no increase in Contract fees and expenses, including mortality and expense risk fees and administration and distribution fees charged to the Separate Accounts as a result of the Substitutions. The Substitution Applicants believe that the Replacement Funds have investment objectives, policies and risk profiles, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially the same as, or sufficiently similar to, the corresponding Existing Funds to make those Replacement Funds appropriate candidates as substitutes. The Insurance Companies considered the performance history of Start Printed Page 18942the Existing Funds and the Replacement Funds and determined that no Contract owners would be materially adversely affected as a result of the Substitutions.
18. The share classes of the Replacement Funds are either identical to or less than the share classes of the Existing Funds with respect to the imposition of Rule 12b-1 fees currently imposed, except with respect to the substitution of ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio (Class E) and UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio/Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio (Class B). However, the total expenses for the T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio will be seven basis points lower than the total expenses of the Existing Fund after the substitution, and the total expenses for the Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio will be 19 basis points less than the total expenses of the Existing Fund after the substitution.
19. Each MIST Replacement Fund's Class B shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be increased to 0.50% and each MIST Replacement Fund's Class E shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be increased to 0.25% by the Replacement Fund's Board of Trustees. Each Met Series Funds' Replacement Fund's Class B shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be increased to 0.50% of net assets by the Replacement Fund's Board of Trustees without shareholder approval. However, Met Series Fund and MIST represent that Rule 12b-1 fees of the Class B and Class E shares of the Replacement Funds issued in connection with the proposed substitutions will not be raised above the current rate without approval of a majority in interest of the respective Replacement Funds' shareholders after the Substitutions. The distributors of the Existing Funds pay to the Insurance Companies, or their affiliates, any Rule 12b-1 fees associated with the class of shares sold to the Separate Accounts. Similarly, the distributors for MIST and Met Series Fund will receive from the applicable class of shares held by the Separate Accounts Rule 12b-1 fees in the same amount or a lesser amount than the amount paid by the Existing Funds, except as described above.
Legal Analysis and Conditions
1. The Substitution Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the proposed substitutions.
2. Applicants represent that the Contracts permit the applicable Insurance Company, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a sub-account of the Separate Accounts. The prospectuses for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right.
3. By a supplement to the prospectuses for the registered Contracts and Separate Accounts and private placement memoranda for the unregistered Contracts and Separate Accounts, each Insurance Company has notified all owners of the Contracts affected by the Substitutions of its intention to take the necessary actions to substitute shares of the funds as described in this notice. The supplement has advised Contract owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed substitution, owners are permitted to make one transfer of Contract value (or annuity unit exchange) out of the Existing Fund sub-account to one or more other sub-accounts without the transfer (or exchange) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge. The supplement also has informed Contract owners that the Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved under any Contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed Substitutions. The supplement also has advised Contract owners that for at least 30 days following the proposed Substitutions, the Insurance Companies will permit Contract owners affected by the Substitutions to make one transfer of Contract value (or annuity unit exchange) out of the Replacement Fund sub-account to one or more other sub-accounts without the transfer (or exchange) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge.
4. The proposed Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's Contract value, cash value, or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts.
5. The process for accomplishing the transfer of assets from each Existing Fund to its corresponding Replacement Fund will be determined on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, it is expected that the Substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of an Existing Fund for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the Replacement Fund. In certain other cases, it is expected that the Substitutions will be effected by redeeming the shares of an Existing Fund in-kind; those assets will then be contributed in-kind to the corresponding Replacement Fund to purchase shares of that Fund.
6. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or an Insurance Company's obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. All expenses incurred in connection with the proposed Substitutions, including brokerage, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses, will be paid by the Insurance Companies. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitutions than before the proposed Substitutions. No fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed Substitutions because the proposed Substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a Contract year.
7. In addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to owners of Contracts, within five business days after the proposed Substitutions are completed, Contract owners will be sent a written notice informing them that the Substitutions were carried out and that they may make one transfer of all Contract value or cash value under a Contract invested in any one of the sub-accounts on the date of the notice to one or more other sub-accounts available under their Contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among sub-accounts or from the variable account options to the fixed account options. The written notice will also reiterate that (other than with respect to “market timing” activity) the Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed Substitutions are completed. The Insurance Companies will also send each Contract owner current prospectuses for the Replacement Funds involved to the extent that they have not previously received copies.
8. Each Insurance Company also is seeking approval of the proposed Substitutions from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate.Start Printed Page 18943

9. The Substitution Applicants agree that for those who were Contract owners on the date of the proposed Substitutions, the Insurance Companies will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four months following the date of the proposed Substitutions, those Contract owners whose sub-account invests in the Replacement Fund such that the sum of the Replacement Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and sub-account expenses (asset-based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Existing Fund's net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and sub-account expenses for fiscal year 2013, except with respect to the ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio, DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. American Franchise Fund/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio and UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio/Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio Substitutions.
10. With respect to the ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio, DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. American Franchise Fund/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio and UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio/Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio Substitutions, the reimbursement agreement with respect to the Replacement Fund's operating expenses and sub-account expenses, will extend for the life of each Contract outstanding on the date of the proposed Substitutions.
11. The Substitution Applicants further agree that, except with respect to the ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio, DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. American Franchise Fund/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio and UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio/Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio Substitutions, they will not increase total separate account charges (net of any reimbursements or waivers) for any existing owner of the Contracts on the date of the substitutions for a period of two years from the date of the substitutions.
12. With respect to the ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio, DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. American Franchise Fund/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio and UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio/Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio Substitutions, the agreement not to increase the separate account charges will extend for the life of each Contract outstanding on the date the proposed Substitutions are completed.
13. In each case, the applicable Insurance Companies believe that it is in the best interests of the Contract owners to substitute the Replacement Fund for the Existing Fund. The Insurance Companies believe that the Replacement Fund's sub-adviser, where applicable, will, over the long term, be positioned to provide at least comparable performance to that of the Existing Fund's sub-adviser.
14. The Substitution Applicants assert that Contract owners will be better off with the array of sub-accounts offered after the proposed Substitutions than they have been with the array of sub-accounts offered prior to the substitutions.
15. The Substitution Applicants represent that none of the proposed Substitutions is of the type that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Unlike traditional unit investment trusts where a depositor could only substitute an investment security in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust, the Contracts provide each Contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer Contract or cash values into other sub-accounts. Moreover, the Insurance Companies will offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected sub-accounts into any of the remaining sub-accounts without cost or other disadvantage. The proposed Substitutions, therefore, will not result in the type of costly forced redemption which Section 26(c) was designed to prevent.
Section 17(b) Relief
1. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit the Insurance Companies to carry out each of the proposed Substitutions.
2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company.
3. Shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company, the Insurance Companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially all of the shares of MIST and Met Series Fund. Therefore, MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are arguably under the control of the Insurance Companies notwithstanding the fact that Contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of the shares held in the Separate Accounts. If MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are under the control of the Insurance Companies, then each Insurance Company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds. If MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are under the control of the Insurance Companies, then MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are affiliated persons of the Insurance Companies. Regardless of whether or not the Insurance Companies can be considered to control MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds, because the Insurance Companies own of record more than 5% of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each Replacement Fund's investment adviser, the Insurance Companies are affiliated persons of both MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds. Likewise, their respective funds are each an affiliated person of the Insurance Companies. The Insurance Companies, through their separate accounts, in the aggregate, own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the following Existing Funds: Invesco V.I. American Value Fund, Invesco V.I. Global Real Estate Fund, Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund, ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio, UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio, Pioneer Disciplined Value VCT Portfolio, Pioneer Emerging Markets VCT Portfolio, Pioneer Equity Income VCT Portfolio, Pioneer Ibbotson Growth Allocation VCT Portfolio, Pioneer Ibbotson Moderate Allocation VCT Portfolio. Therefore, each Insurance Company is an affiliated person of those funds. All in-kind redemptions from an Start Printed Page 18944Existing Fund of which any of the Substitution Applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Commission's no-action letter issued to Signature Financial Group, Inc. (available December 28, 1999).
4. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the In-Kind Transactions, as described in the application, meet the conditions set forth in Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.
5. Section 17 Applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchase transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received by each Fund involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions (that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash) enumerated in Rule 17a-7 of the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the Separate Accounts. The Applicants assert that Contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the substitutions.
6. The Boards of Trustees of MIST and Met Series Fund have adopted procedures, as required by paragraph (e)(1) of Rule 17a-7, pursuant to which the series of each may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates. The Section 17 Applicants assert they will carry out the proposed Insurance Company in-kind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and each series' procedures thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Nevertheless, the Substitution Applicants state that the circumstances surrounding the proposed Substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each Replacement Fund from overreaching that Rule 17a-7 provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that Rule in the ordinary course of their business. In particular, the Insurance Companies (or any of their affiliates) cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the Replacement Funds. Although the transactions may not be entirely for cash, each will be effected based upon (1) the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-7, and (2) the net asset value per share of each Fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective investment company registration statement and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the Act. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed in-kind purchase transactions.
7. The sale of shares of Replacement Funds for investment securities, as contemplated by the proposed Insurance Company in-kind purchases, is consistent with the investment policies and restrictions of the Investment Companies and the Replacement Funds because (1) the shares are sold at their net asset value, and (2) the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the Replacement Funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash. To assure that the second of these conditions is met, MetLife Advisers, LLC and the sub-adviser, as applicable, will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each Replacement Fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such Fund in a cash transaction.
8. The Section 17 Applicants represent that the proposed in-kind purchases meet all of the requirements of Section 17(b) of the Act and that an exemption should be granted, to the extent necessary, from the provisions of Section 17(a). 
Conclusion
Applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the Act and are consistent with the standards of Section 17(b) of the Act and that the requested orders should be granted.

shall be return the applicable portion of the premium to the Employer.          

5. Beneficiary - any death benefits claimed under this Agreement shall be       
payable to the employer unless an alternative beneficiary is named in the

    11. MetLife Advisers, LLC is the investment adviser of each of the Replacement Funds.    12. The Substitution Applicants believe the Substitutions will provide significant benefits to Contract owners, including improved selection of sub-advisers and simplification of fund offerings through the elimination of overlapping offerings.    13. Based on generally better performance records and lower total expenses of the Replacement Funds, the Substitution Applicants believe that the sub-advisers to the Replacement Funds overall may provide more consistent performance for their Funds than the advisers or sub-advisers of the Existing Funds (other than those advisers or sub-advisers that manage both the Existing Fund and the Replacement Fund). At the same time, Applicants assert that Contract owners will continue to be able to select among a similar number of investment options, with a similar range of investment objectives, investment strategies, and managers.    14. As a result of the Substitutions, the number of investment options offered under the Contracts may change slightly. That number, which currently ranges from three to 122, will range from three to 120 following the Substitutions. For the Contracts that will experience a reduction in the number of available investment options, the Applicants assert that none will be reduced by more than two investment options and all will have at least 15 available investment options after the Substitutions. With respect to products with fewer than 20 open investment options, only one product's investment options will be reduced, moving from 16 to 15 investment options.    15. The Substitutions will replace investment options advised by investment advisers that are not affiliated with the Substitution Applicants with funds for which MetLife Advisers, LLC acts as investment adviser, which will permit MetLife Advisers, LLC, under the exemptive orders issued to New England Funds Trust I, et al., Inv. Co. Rel. No. 22824 (1997) (order), Inv. Co. Release No. 23859 (1999) (amended order) (the ``Multi-Manager Order'') to enter into and amend sub-advisory agreements without shareholder approval under certain conditions to hire, monitor and replace sub-advisers as necessary to achieve optimal performance. Met Series Fund and MIST have been subject to the Multi-Manager Order since 1999 and 2000, respectively.    16. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, except for the DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio and Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio, the management fees of the Replacement Funds are the same or lower than that of the respective Existing Fund. With respect to the DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio substitution, the net expenses (after waivers) of Jennison Growth Portfolio were 0.01% lower than those of DWS Capital Growth VIP. With respect to the Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio substitution, the total expenses (before waivers) and net expenses (after waivers) of Invesco Comstock Portfolio were lower than those of Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund.    17. The Applicants assert the Substitutions will result in decreased net expense ratios, after waivers, ranging from 0.01% to 0.66%. Moreover, there will be no increase in Contract fees and expenses, including mortality and expense risk fees and administration and distribution fees charged to the Separate Accounts as a result of the Substitutions. The Substitution Applicants believe that the Replacement Funds have investment objectives, policies and risk profiles, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially the same as, or sufficiently similar to, the corresponding Existing Funds to make those Replacement Funds appropriate candidates as substitutes. The Insurance Companies considered the performance history of
Page 18942
the Existing Funds and the Replacement Funds and determined that no Contract owners would be materially adversely affected as a result of the Substitutions.    18. The share classes of the Replacement Funds are either identical to or less than the share classes of the Existing Funds with respect to the imposition of Rule 12b-1 fees currently imposed, except with respect to the substitution of ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio (Class E) and UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio/Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio (Class B). However, the total expenses for the T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio will be seven basis points lower than the total expenses of the Existing Fund after the substitution, and the total expenses for the Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio will be 19 basis points less than the total expenses of the Existing Fund after the substitution.    19. Each MIST Replacement Fund's Class B shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be increased to 0.50% and each MIST Replacement Fund's Class E shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be increased to 0.25% by the Replacement Fund's Board of Trustees. Each Met Series Funds' Replacement Fund's Class B shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be increased to 0.50% of net assets by the Replacement Fund's Board of Trustees without shareholder approval. However, Met Series Fund and MIST represent that Rule 12b-1 fees of the Class B and Class E shares of the Replacement Funds issued in connection with the proposed substitutions will not be raised above the current rate without approval of a majority in interest of the respective Replacement Funds' shareholders after the Substitutions. The distributors of the Existing Funds pay to the Insurance Companies, or their affiliates, any Rule 12b-1 fees associated with the class of shares sold to the Separate Accounts. Similarly, the distributors for MIST and Met Series Fund will receive from the applicable class of shares held by the Separate Accounts Rule 12b-1 fees in the same amount or a lesser amount than the amount paid by the Existing Funds, except as described above.
Legal Analysis and Conditions
    1. The Substitution Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the proposed substitutions.    2. Applicants represent that the Contracts permit the applicable Insurance Company, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a sub-account of the Separate Accounts. The prospectuses for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right.    3. By a supplement to the prospectuses for the registered Contracts and Separate Accounts and private placement memoranda for the unregistered Contracts and Separate Accounts, each Insurance Company has notified all owners of the Contracts affected by the Substitutions of its intention to take the necessary actions to substitute shares of the funds as described in this notice. The supplement has advised Contract owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed substitution, owners are permitted to make one transfer of Contract value (or annuity unit exchange) out of the Existing Fund sub-account to one or more other sub-accounts without the transfer (or exchange) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge. The supplement also has informed Contract owners that the Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved under any Contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed Substitutions. The supplement also has advised Contract owners that for at least 30 days following the proposed Substitutions, the Insurance Companies will permit Contract owners affected by the Substitutions to make one transfer of Contract value (or annuity unit exchange) out of the Replacement Fund sub-account to one or more other sub-accounts without the transfer (or exchange) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge.    4. The proposed Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's Contract value, cash value, or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts.    5. The process for accomplishing the transfer of assets from each Existing Fund to its corresponding Replacement Fund will be determined on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, it is expected that the Substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of an Existing Fund for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the Replacement Fund. In certain other cases, it is expected that the Substitutions will be effected by redeeming the shares of an Existing Fund in-kind; those assets will then be contributed in-kind to the corresponding Replacement Fund to purchase shares of that Fund.    6. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or an Insurance Company's obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. All expenses incurred in connection with the proposed Substitutions, including brokerage, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses, will be paid by the Insurance Companies. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitutions than before the proposed Substitutions. No fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed Substitutions because the proposed Substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a Contract year.    7. In addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to owners of Contracts, within five business days after the proposed Substitutions are completed, Contract owners will be sent a written notice informing them that the Substitutions were carried out and that they may make one transfer of all Contract value or cash value under a Contract invested in any one of the sub-accounts on the date of the notice to one or more other sub-accounts available under their Contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among sub-accounts or from the variable account options to the fixed account options. The written notice will also reiterate that (other than with respect to ``market timing'' activity) the Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed Substitutions are completed. The Insurance Companies will also send each Contract owner current prospectuses for the Replacement Funds involved to the extent that they have not previously received copies.    8. Each Insurance Company also is seeking approval of the proposed Substitutions from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate.

    9. The Substitution Applicants agree that for those who were Contract owners on the date of the proposed Substitutions, the Insurance Companies will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four months following the date of the proposed Substitutions, those Contract owners whose sub-account invests in the Replacement Fund such that the sum of the Replacement Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and sub-account expenses (asset-based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Existing Fund's net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and sub-account expenses for fiscal year 2013, except with respect to the ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio, DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. American Franchise Fund/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio and UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio/Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio Substitutions.    10. With respect to the ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio, DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. American Franchise Fund/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio and UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio/Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio Substitutions, the reimbursement agreement with respect to the Replacement Fund's operating expenses and sub-account expenses, will extend for the life of each Contract outstanding on the date of the proposed Substitutions.    11. The Substitution Applicants further agree that, except with respect to the ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio, DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. American Franchise Fund/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio and UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio/Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio Substitutions, they will not increase total separate account charges (net of any reimbursements or waivers) for any existing owner of the Contracts on the date of the substitutions for a period of two years from the date of the substitutions.    12. With respect to the ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Value Portfolio, DWS Capital Growth VIP/Jennison Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. American Franchise Fund/T. Rowe Price Large Cap Growth Portfolio, Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund/Invesco Comstock Portfolio and UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio/Clarion Global Real Estate Portfolio Substitutions, the agreement not to increase the separate account charges will extend for the life of each Contract outstanding on the date the proposed Substitutions are completed.    13. In each case, the applicable Insurance Companies believe that it is in the best interests of the Contract owners to substitute the Replacement Fund for the Existing Fund. The Insurance Companies believe that the Replacement Fund's sub-adviser, where applicable, will, over the long term, be positioned to provide at least comparable performance to that of the Existing Fund's sub-adviser.    14. The Substitution Applicants assert that Contract owners will be better off with the array of sub-accounts offered after the proposed Substitutions than they have been with the array of sub-accounts offered prior to the substitutions.    15. The Substitution Applicants represent that none of the proposed Substitutions is of the type that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Unlike traditional unit investment trusts where a depositor could only substitute an investment security in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust, the Contracts provide each Contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer Contract or cash values into other sub-accounts. Moreover, the Insurance Companies will offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected sub-accounts into any of the remaining sub-accounts without cost or other disadvantage. The proposed Substitutions, therefore, will not result in the type of costly forced redemption which Section 26(c) was designed to prevent.
Section 17(b) Relief
    1. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit the Insurance Companies to carry out each of the proposed Substitutions.    2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company.    3. Shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company, the Insurance Companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially all of the shares of MIST and Met Series Fund. Therefore, MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are arguably under the control of the Insurance Companies notwithstanding the fact that Contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of the shares held in the Separate Accounts. If MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are under the control of the Insurance Companies, then each Insurance Company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds. If MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are under the control of the Insurance Companies, then MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are affiliated persons of the Insurance Companies. Regardless of whether or not the Insurance Companies can be considered to control MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds, because the Insurance Companies own of record more than 5% of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each Replacement Fund's investment adviser, the Insurance Companies are affiliated persons of both MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds. Likewise, their respective funds are each an affiliated person of the Insurance Companies. The Insurance Companies, through their separate accounts, in the aggregate, own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the following Existing Funds: Invesco V.I. American Value Fund, Invesco V.I. Global Real Estate Fund, Invesco V.I. Growth and Income Fund, ClearBridge Variable All Cap Value Portfolio, UIF U.S. Real Estate Portfolio, Pioneer Disciplined Value VCT Portfolio, Pioneer Emerging Markets VCT Portfolio, Pioneer Equity Income VCT Portfolio, Pioneer Ibbotson Growth Allocation VCT Portfolio, Pioneer Ibbotson Moderate Allocation VCT Portfolio. Therefore, each Insurance Company is an affiliated person of those funds. All in-kind redemptions from an
Page 18944
Existing Fund of which any of the Substitution Applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Commission's no-action letter issued to Signature Financial Group, Inc. (available December 28, 1999).    4. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the In-Kind Transactions, as described in the application, meet the conditions set forth in Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.    5. Section 17 Applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchase transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received by each Fund involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions (that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash) enumerated in Rule 17a-7 of the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the Separate Accounts. The Applicants assert that Contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the substitutions.    6. The Boards of Trustees of MIST and Met Series Fund have adopted procedures, as required by paragraph (e)(1) of Rule 17a-7, pursuant to which the series of each may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates. The Section 17 Applicants assert they will carry out the proposed Insurance Company in-kind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and each series' procedures thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Nevertheless, the Substitution Applicants state that the circumstances surrounding the proposed Substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each Replacement Fund from overreaching that Rule 17a-7 provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that Rule in the ordinary course of their business. In particular, the Insurance Companies (or any of their affiliates) cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the Replacement Funds. Although the transactions may not be entirely for cash, each will be effected based upon (1) the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-7, and (2) the net asset value per share of each Fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective investment company registration statement and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the Act. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed in-kind purchase transactions.    7. The sale of shares of Replacement Funds for investment securities, as contemplated by the proposed Insurance Company in-kind purchases, is consistent with the investment policies and restrictions of the Investment Companies and the Replacement Funds because (1) the shares are sold at their net asset value, and (2) the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the Replacement Funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash. To assure that the second of these conditions is met, MetLife Advisers, LLC and the sub-adviser, as applicable, will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each Replacement Fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such Fund in a cash transaction.    8. The Section 17 Applicants represent that the proposed in-kind purchases meet all of the requirements of Section 17(b) of the Act and that an exemption should be granted, to the extent necessary, from the provisions of Section 17(a).
Conclusion
    Applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the Act and are consistent with the standards of Section 17(b) of the Act and that the requested orders should be granted.

proposed substitutions to a rate that
would offset the difference in the
expense ratio between each Existing
Fund’s net expense ratio and the net
expense ratio for the respective
Replacement Fund.
19. Except for the Templeton Growth
Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth
Portfolio substitution where there is an
increase in net expenses after waivers of
0.01% and the Pioneer Fund VCT
Portfolio/Pioneer Fund Portfolio where
there is no increase or decrease in net
expense ratios, after waivers, the
substitutions will result in decreased
net expense ratios, after waivers,
ranging from 1 basis point to 24 basis
points. Moreover, there will be no
increase in Contract fees and expenses,
including mortality and expense risk

fees and administration and distribution
fees charged to the Separate Accounts as
a result of the substitutions.
20. The Substitution Applicants
believe that the Replacement Funds
have investment objectives, policies and
risk profiles, as described in their
prospectuses, that are substantially the
same as, or sufficiently similar to, the
corresponding Existing Funds to make
those Replacement Funds appropriate
candidates as substitutes.
21. In addition, after the substitutions,
neither MetLife Advisers, LLC nor any
of their affiliates will receive
compensation from the charges to the
Separate Accounts related to the
Contracts or from Rule 12b-1 fees or
revenue sharing from the Replacement
Funds in excess of the compensation
currently received from the investment
advisers or distributors of the Existing
Funds.
22. The share classes of the
Replacement Funds are either identical
to or less than the share classes of the
Existing Funds with respect to the
imposition of Rule 12b-1 fees currently
imposed, except with respect to the
substitution of MFS Research
International Portfolio (Class B shares—
0.25%) for Legg Mason Global Currents
Variable International All Cap
Opportunity Portfolio (single share
class—0%); Western Asset Management
Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio
(Class B shares—0.25%) for Legg Mason
Western Asset Variable Diversified
Strategic Income Portfolio (single share
class—0%); Western Asset Management
Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio
(Class B shares—0.25%) for Legg Mason
Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond
Portfolio (Class I—0%).
23. Each MIST and Met Series Fund
Replacement Fund’s Class B shares Rule
12b-1 fees can be raised to 0.50%, each
MIST Replacement Fund’s Class E
shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be raised to
0.25% and each Met Series Fund
Replacement Fund’s Class E shares Rule
12b-1 fees can be raised to 0.50% of net
assets by the Replacement Fund’s Board
of Directors/Trustees without
shareholder approval. However, Met
Series Fund and MIST represent that
Rule 12b-1 fees of the Class B and Class
E shares of the Replacement Funds
issued in connection with the proposed
substitutions will not be raised above
the current rate without approval of a
majority in interest of the respective
Replacement Funds’ shareholders after
the substitutions.
24. The distributors of the Existing
Funds pay to the Insurance Companies,
or their affiliates, any 12b-1 fees
associated with the class of shares sold
to the Separate Accounts. Similarly, the

PO 00000

Frm 00093

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

distributors for MIST and Met Series
Fund will receive from the applicable
class of shares held by the Separate
Accounts Rule 12b-1 fees in the same
amount or a lesser amount than the
amount paid by the Existing Funds,
except as described above.
25. Further, in addition to any Rule
12b-1 fees, the investment advisers or
distributors of the Existing Funds pay
the Insurance Companies or one of their
affiliates from 0 to 50 basis points for
the Existing Funds’ classes of shares
involved in the substitutions. Following
the substitutions, these payments will
not be made on behalf of the
Replacement Funds. Rather, the
Insurance Companies or their affiliates
will have available both the 25 and 15
basis points in Rule 12b-1 fees from the
Replacement Funds (with respect to
Class B and Class E shares, respectively)
and, as owners of the Replacement
Funds’ adviser, profit distributions from
the adviser. These profits from
investment advisory fees may be more
or less than the fees being paid by the
Existing Funds.
Applicants’ Legal Analysis and
Conditions
1. The Substitution Applicants
request that the Commission issue an
order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the
Act approving the proposed
substitutions.
2. Applicants represent that the
Contracts permit the applicable
Insurance Company, subject to
compliance with applicable law, to
substitute shares of another investment
company for shares of an investment
company held by a sub-account of the
Separate Accounts. The prospectuses for
the Contracts and the Separate Accounts
contain appropriate disclosure of this
right.
3. By a supplement to the
prospectuses for the Contracts and the
Separate Accounts, each Insurance
Company has notified all owners of the
Contracts of its intention to take the
necessary actions, including seeking the
order requested by this Application, to
substitute shares of the funds as
described herein. The supplement has
advised Contract owners that from the
date of the supplement until the date of
the proposed substitution, owners are
permitted to make one transfer of
Contract value (or annuity unit
exchange) out of the Existing Fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer (or
exchange) being treated as one of a
limited number of permitted transfers
(or exchanges) or a limited number of
transfers (or exchanges) permitted
without a transfer charge. The

E:\FR\FM\04JAN1.SGM

04JAN1

jlentini on DSKJ8SOYB1PROD with NOTICES

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 2 / Tuesday, January 4, 2011 / Notices
supplement also has informed Contract
owners that the Insurance Company will
not exercise any rights reserved under
any Contract to impose additional
restrictions on transfers until at least 30
days after the proposed substitutions.
The supplement has also advised
Contract owners that for at least 30 days
following the proposed substitutions,
the Insurance Companies will permit
Contract owners affected by the
substitutions to make one transfer of
Contract value (or annuity unit
exchange) out of the Replacement Fund
sub-account to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer (or
exchange) being treated as one of a
limited number of permitted transfers
(or exchanges) or a limited number of
transfers (or exchanges) permitted
without a transfer charge.
4. The proposed substitutions will
take place at relative net asset value
with no change in the amount of any
Contract owner’s Contract value, cash
value, or death benefit or in the dollar
value of his or her investment in the
Separate Accounts.
5. The process for accomplishing the
transfer of assets from each Existing
Fund to its corresponding Replacement
Fund will be determined on a case-bycase basis. In most cases, it is expected
that the substitutions will be effected by
redeeming shares of an Existing Fund
for cash and using the cash to purchase
shares of the Replacement Fund. In
certain other cases, it is expected that
the substitutions will be effected by
redeeming the shares of an Existing
Fund in-kind; those assets will then be
contributed in-kind to the
corresponding Replacement Fund to
purchase shares of that Fund. All inkind redemptions from an Existing
Fund of which any of the Substitution
Applicants is an affiliated person will
be effected in accordance with the
conditions set forth in the Commission’s
no-action letter issued to Signature
Financial Group, Inc. (available
December 28, 1999).
6. Contract owners will not incur any
fees or charges as a result of the
proposed substitutions, nor will their
rights or an Insurance Company’s
obligations under the Contracts be
altered in any way. All expenses
incurred in connection with the
proposed substitutions, including
brokerage, legal, accounting, and other
fees and expenses, will be paid by the
Insurance Companies. In addition, the
proposed substitutions will not impose
any tax liability on Contract owners.
The proposed substitutions will not
cause the Contract fees and charges
currently being paid by existing
Contract owners to be greater after the

VerDate Mar<15>2010

14:35 Jan 03, 2011

Jkt 223001

proposed substitutions than before the
proposed substitutions. No fees will be
charged on the transfers made at the
time of the proposed substitutions,
because the proposed substitutions will
not be treated as a transfer for the
purpose of assessing transfer charges or
for determining the number of
remaining permissible transfers in a
Contract year.
7. In addition to the prospectus
supplements distributed to owners of
Contracts, within five business days
after the proposed substitutions are
completed, Contract owners will be sent
a written notice informing them that the
substitutions were carried out and that
they may make one transfer of all
Contract value or cash value under a
Contract invested in any one of the subaccounts on the date of the notice to one
or more other sub-accounts available
under their Contract at no cost and
without regard to the usual limit on the
frequency of transfers among subaccounts or from the variable account
options to the fixed account options.
The notice will also reiterate that (other
than with respect to ‘‘market timing’’
activity) the Insurance Company will
not exercise any rights reserved by it
under the Contracts to impose
additional restrictions on transfers or to
impose any charges on transfers until at
least 30 days after the proposed
substitutions. The Insurance Companies
will also send each Contract owner
current prospectuses for the
Replacement Funds involved to the
extent that they have not previously
received a copy.
8. Each Insurance Company also is
seeking approval of the proposed
substitutions from any State insurance
regulators whose approval may be
necessary or appropriate.
9. The Substitution Applicants agree
that for those who were Contract owners
on the date of the proposed
substitutions, the Insurance Companies
will reimburse, on the last business day
of each fiscal period (not to exceed a
fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four
months following the date of the
proposed substitutions, those Contract
owners whose sub-account invests in
the Replacement Fund such that the
sum of the Replacement Fund’s net
operating expenses (taking into account
fee waivers and expense
reimbursements) and sub-account
expenses (asset-based fees and charges
deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the
calculation of sub-account unit values)
for such period will not exceed, on an
annualized basis, the sum of the
Existing Fund’s net operating expenses
taking into account fee waivers and

substitutions, the agreement not to
increase the separate account charges
will extend for the life of each Contract
outstanding on the date of the proposed
substitutions.
13. In each case, the applicable
Insurance Companies believe that it is
in the best interests of the Contract
owners to substitute the Replacement
Fund for the Existing Fund. The
Insurance Companies believe that in
cases where the Replacement Fund has
a new sub-adviser, the new sub-adviser
will, over the long term, be positioned
to provide at least comparable
performance to that of the Existing
Fund’s sub-adviser.
14. The Substitution Applicants
anticipate that Contract owners will be
better off with the array of sub-accounts
offered after the proposed substitutions
than they have been with the array of
sub-accounts offered prior to the
substitutions.
15. The Substitution Applicants
submit that none of the proposed
substitutions is of the type that Section
26(c) was designed to prevent.
16. The Substitution Applicants
request an order of the Commission
pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act
approving the proposed substitutions by
the Insurance Companies.
17. The Section 17 Applicants request
an order under Section 17(b) exempting

VerDate Mar<15>2010

14:35 Jan 03, 2011

Jkt 223001

them from the provisions of Section
17(a) to the extent necessary to permit
the Insurance Companies to carry out
each of the proposed substitutions.
18. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in
relevant part, prohibits any affiliated
person of a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of
such person, acting as principal, from
knowingly selling any security or other
property to that company. Section
17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits
the persons described above, acting as
principals, from knowingly purchasing
any security or other property from the
registered company.
19. Because shares held by a separate
account of an insurance company are
legally owned by the insurance
company, the Insurance Companies and
their affiliates collectively own of record
substantially all of the shares of MIST
and Met Series Fund. Therefore, MIST
and Met Series Fund and their
respective funds are arguably under the
control of the Insurance Companies
notwithstanding the fact that Contract
owners may be considered the
beneficial owners of those shares held
in the Separate Accounts. If MIST and
Met Series Fund and their respective
funds are under the control of the
Insurance Companies, then each
Insurance Company is an affiliated
person or an affiliated person of an
affiliated person of MIST and Met Series
Fund and their respective funds. If
MIST and Met Series Fund and their
respective funds are under the control of
the Insurance Companies, then MIST
and Met Series Fund and their
respective funds are affiliated persons of
the Insurance Companies.
20. Regardless of whether or not the
Insurance Companies can be considered
to control MIST and Met Series Fund
and their respective funds, because the
Insurance Companies own of record
more than 5% of the shares of each of
them and are under common control
with each Replacement Fund’s
investment adviser, the Insurance
Companies are affiliated persons of both
MIST and Met Series Fund and their
respective funds. Likewise, their
respective funds are each an affiliated
person of the Insurance Companies.
21. The Insurance Companies,
through their separate accounts in the
aggregate own more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of the following
Existing Funds: Janus Aspen Global
Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason
Clearbridge Variable Capital Portfolio,
Legg Mason Global Currents Variable
International All Cap Opportunity
Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset
Variable Diversified Strategic Income
Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset

PO 00000

Frm 00095

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio,
Pioneer Bond VCT Portfolio and Pioneer
Fund VCT Portfolio. Therefore, each
Insurance Company is an affiliated
person of those funds.
22. Because the substitutions may be
effected, in whole or in part, by means
of in-kind redemptions and purchases,
the substitutions may be deemed to
involve one or more purchases or sales
of securities or property between
affiliated persons. The proposed
transactions may involve a transfer of
portfolio securities by the Existing
Funds to the Insurance Companies;
immediately thereafter, the Insurance
Companies would purchase shares of
the Replacement Funds with the
portfolio securities received from the
Existing Funds. Accordingly, as the
Insurance Companies and certain of the
Existing Funds listed above, and the
Insurance Companies and the
Replacement Funds, could be viewed as
affiliated persons of one another under
Section 2(a)(3) of the Act, it is
conceivable that this aspect of the
substitutions could be viewed as being
prohibited by Section 17(a).
23. Section 17(b) of the Act provides
that the Commission may, upon
application, grant an order exempting
any transaction from the prohibitions of
Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes
that: (a) The terms of the proposed
transaction, including the consideration
to be paid or received, are reasonable
and fair and do not involve
overreaching on the part of any person
concerned; (b) the proposed transaction
is consistent with the policy of each
registered investment company
concerned, as recited in its registration
statement and records filed under the
Act; and (c) the proposed transaction is
consistent with the general purposes of
the Act.
24. The Section 17 Applicants submit
that for all the reasons stated above the
terms of the proposed in-kind purchases
of shares of the Replacement Funds by
the Insurance Companies, including the
consideration to be paid and received,
as described in this Application, are
reasonable and fair and do not involve
overreaching on the part of any person
concerned. The Section 17 Applicants
also submit that the proposed in-kind
purchases by the Insurance Companies
are consistent with the policies of: (a)
MIST and of its Third Avenue Small
Cap Value, RCM Technology, Met/
Templeton Growth, MFS Research
International, PIMCO Total Return, and
Pioneer Fund Portfolios; and (b) Met
Series Fund and of its Davis Venture
Value, Western Asset Management
Strategic Bond Opportunities and Van
Eck Global Natural Resources Portfolios,

E:\FR\FM\04JAN1.SGM

04JAN1

jlentini on DSKJ8SOYB1PROD with NOTICES

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 2 / Tuesday, January 4, 2011 / Notices
as recited in the current registration
statements and reports filed by each
under the Act. Finally, the Section 17
Applicants submit that the proposed
substitutions are consistent with the
general purposes of the Act.
25. To the extent that the in-kind
purchases by the Insurance Company of
the Replacement Funds’ shares are
deemed to involve principal
transactions among affiliated persons,
the procedures described below should
be sufficient to assure that the terms of
the proposed transactions are reasonable
and fair to all participants. The Section
17 Applicants maintain that the terms of
the proposed in-kind purchase
transactions, including the
consideration to be paid and received by
each fund involved, are reasonable, fair
and do not involve overreaching
principally because the transactions will
conform with all but one of the
conditions enumerated in Rule 17a–7.
The proposed transactions will take
place at relative net asset value in
conformity with the requirements of
Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c–
1 thereunder with no change in the
amount of any Contract owner’s contract
value or death benefit or in the dollar
value of his or her investment in any of
the Separate Accounts. Contract owners
will not suffer any adverse tax
consequences as a result of the
substitutions. The fees and charges
under the Contracts will not increase
because of the substitutions. Even
though the Separate Accounts, the
Insurance Companies, MIST and Met
Series Fund may not rely on Rule 17a–
7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that
the Rule’s conditions outline the type of
safeguards that result in transactions
that are fair and reasonable to registered
investment company participants and
preclude overreaching in connection
with an investment company by its
affiliated persons. In addition, as stated
above, the in-kind redemptions will
only be made in accordance with the
conditions set out in the Signature
Financial Group no-action letter
(December 29, 1999).
26. The boards of MIST and Met
Series Fund have adopted procedures,
as required by paragraph (e)(1) of Rule
17a–7, pursuant to which the series of
each may purchase and sell securities to
and from their affiliates. The Section 17
Applicants will carry out the proposed
Insurance Company in-kind purchases
in conformity with all of the conditions
of Rule 17a–7 and each series’
procedures thereunder, except that the
consideration paid for the securities
being purchased or sold may not be
entirely cash. Nevertheless, the
circumstances surrounding the

VerDate Mar<15>2010

14:35 Jan 03, 2011

Jkt 223001

proposed substitutions will be such as
to offer the same degree of protection to
each Replacement Fund from
overreaching that Rule 17a–7 provides
to them generally in connection with
their purchase and sale of securities
under that Rule in the ordinary course
of their business. In particular, the
Insurance Companies (or any of their
affiliates) cannot effect the proposed
transactions at a price that is
disadvantageous to any of the
Replacement Funds. Although the
transactions may not be entirely for
cash, each will be effected based upon
(1) the independent market price of the
portfolio securities valued as specified
in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a–7, and (2)
the net asset value per share of each
fund involved valued in accordance
with the procedures disclosed in its
respective investment company
registration statement and as required
by Rule 22c–1 under the Act. No
brokerage commission, fee, or other
remuneration will be paid to any party
in connection with the proposed in kind
purchase transactions.
27. The sale of shares of Replacement
Funds for investment securities, as
contemplated by the proposed
Insurance Company in-kind purchases,
is consistent with the investment
policies and restrictions of the
Investment Companies and the
Replacement Funds because (a) the
shares are sold at their net asset value,
and (b) the portfolio securities are of the
type and quality that the Replacement
Funds would each have acquired with
the proceeds from share sales had the
shares been sold for cash. To assure that
the second of these conditions is met,
MetLife Advisers, LLC and the subadviser, as applicable, will examine the
portfolio securities being offered to each
Replacement Fund and accept only
those securities as consideration for
shares that it would have acquired for
each such fund in a cash transaction.
28. The Section 17 Applicants submit
that the proposed Insurance Company
in-kind purchases are consistent with
the general purposes of the Act as stated
in the Findings and Declaration of
Policy in Section 1 of the Act and that
the proposed transactions do not
present any of the conditions or abuses
that the Act was designed to prevent.
29. The Section 17 Applicants request
that the Commission issue an order
pursuant to Section 17(b) of the Act
exempting the Separate Accounts, the
Insurance Companies, MIST, Met Series
Fund and each Replacement Fund from
the provisions of Section 17(a) of the
Act to the extent necessary to permit the
Insurance Companies on behalf of the
Separate Accounts to carry out, as part

of the substitutions, the in-kind
purchase of shares of the Replacement
Funds which may be deemed to be
prohibited by Section 17(a) of the Act.
Conclusion
Applicants assert that for the reasons
summarized above that the proposed
substitutions and related transactions
meet the standards of Section 26(c) of
the Act and are consistent with the
standards of Section 17(b) of the Act
and that the requested orders should be
granted.
For the Commission, by the Division of
Investment Management pursuant to
delegated authority.

    12. MetLife Advisers, LLC is the adviser of each of the Replacement 
Funds. Each Replacement Fund currently offers up to four classes of 
shares, three of which, Class A, Class B and Class E are involved in 
the substitutions.
    13. The Applicants believe the substitutions will provide 
significant benefits to Contract owners, including improved selection 
of sub-advisers and simplification of fund offerings through the 
elimination of overlapping offerings.
    14. As a result of the substitutions, the number of investment 
options offered under substantially all of the Contracts will not 
change (currently ranges in number from 12 to 121). For the limited 
number of Contracts that will experience a reduction in the number of 
available investment options, no contract will ever be reduced by more 
than 2 investment options after the substitutions.
    15. Those substitutions which replace investment options advised by 
investment advisers that are not

affiliated with the Substitution Applicants with funds for which 
MetLife Advisers, LLC acts as investment adviser will permit each 
adviser, under the Multi-Manager Order, [IC-22824 (1997) and IC-23859 
(1999)], to hire, monitor and replace sub-advisers as necessary to 
achieve optimal performance.
    16. Contract owners with sub-account balances invested (through the 
separate account) in shares of the Replacement Funds, except for the 
Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio 
substitution, will have the same or lower total expense ratios taking 
into account fund expenses and current fee waivers.
    17. In the following substitutions, the management fee and/or 
applicable Rule 12b-1 fee of the Replacement Fund are either currently 
higher, or, at certain management fee breakpoints, may be higher than 
those of the respective Existing Fund: Delaware VIP Small Cap Value 
Series/Third Avenue Small Cap Value Portfolio; Janus Aspen Global 
Technology Portfolio/RCM Technology Portfolio; Legg Mason Global 
Currents Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio/MFS

Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic 
Bond Opportunities Portfolio; Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund 
Portfolio; Templeton Growth Fund, Inc./Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio; 
and Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio.
    18. The Substitution Applicants propose to limit Contract charges 
attributable to Contract value invested in the Replacement Funds 
following the proposed substitutions to a rate that would offset the 
difference in the expense ratio between each Existing Fund's net 
expense ratio and the net expense ratio for the respective Replacement 
Fund.
    19. Except for the Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton 
Growth Portfolio substitution where there is an increase in net 
expenses after waivers of 0.01% and the Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/
Pioneer Fund Portfolio where there is no increase or decrease in net 
expense ratios, after waivers, the substitutions will result in 
decreased net expense ratios, after waivers, ranging from 1 basis point 
to 24 basis points. Moreover, there will be no increase in Contract 
fees and expenses, including mortality and expense risk fees and 
administration and distribution fees charged to the Separate Accounts 
as a result of the substitutions.
    20. The Substitution Applicants believe that the Replacement Funds 
have investment objectives, policies and risk profiles, as described in 
their prospectuses, that are substantially the same as, or sufficiently 
similar to, the corresponding Existing Funds to make those Replacement 
Funds appropriate candidates as substitutes.
    21. In addition, after the substitutions, neither MetLife Advisers, 
LLC nor any of their affiliates will receive compensation from the 
charges to the Separate Accounts related to the Contracts or from Rule 
12b-1 fees or revenue sharing from the Replacement Funds in excess of 
the compensation currently received from the investment advisers or 
distributors of the Existing Funds.
    22. The share classes of the Replacement Funds are either identical 
to or less than the share classes of the Existing Funds with respect to 
the imposition of Rule 12b-1 fees currently imposed, except with 
respect to the substitution of MFS Research International Portfolio 
(Class B shares--0.25%) for Legg Mason Global Currents Variable 
International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio (single share class--0%); 
Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio (Class 
B shares--0.25%) for Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified 
Strategic Income Portfolio (single share class--0%); Western Asset 
Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio (Class B shares--
0.25%) for Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio 
(Class I--0%).
    23. Each MIST and Met Series Fund Replacement Fund's Class B shares 
Rule 12b-1 fees can be raised to 0.50%, each MIST Replacement Fund's 
Class E shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be raised to 0.25% and each Met 
Series Fund Replacement Fund's Class E shares Rule 12b-1 fees can be 
raised to 0.50% of net assets by the Replacement Fund's Board of 
Directors/Trustees without shareholder approval. However, Met Series 
Fund and MIST represent that Rule 12b-1 fees of the Class B and Class E 
shares of the Replacement Funds issued in connection with the proposed 
substitutions will not be raised above the current rate without 
approval of a majority in interest of the respective Replacement Funds' 
shareholders after the substitutions.
    24. The distributors of the Existing Funds pay to the Insurance 
Companies, or their affiliates, any 12b-1 fees associated with the 
class of shares sold to the Separate Accounts. Similarly, the 
distributors for MIST and Met Series Fund will receive from the 
applicable class of shares held by the Separate Accounts Rule 12b-1 
fees in the same amount or a lesser amount than the amount paid by the 
Existing Funds, except as described above.
    25. Further, in addition to any Rule 12b-1 fees, the investment 
advisers or distributors of the Existing Funds pay the Insurance 
Companies or one of their affiliates from 0 to 50 basis points for the 
Existing Funds' classes of shares involved in the substitutions. 
Following the substitutions, these payments will not be made on behalf 
of the Replacement Funds. Rather, the Insurance Companies or their 
affiliates will have available both the 25 and 15 basis points in Rule 
12b-1 fees from the Replacement Funds (with respect to Class B and 
Class E shares, respectively) and, as owners of the Replacement Funds' 
adviser, profit distributions from the adviser. These profits from 
investment advisory fees may be more or less than the fees being paid 
by the Existing Funds.

Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions

    1. The Substitution Applicants request that the Commission issue an 
order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the proposed 
substitutions.
    2. Applicants represent that the Contracts permit the applicable 
Insurance Company, subject to compliance with applicable law, to 
substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an 
investment company held by a sub-account of the Separate Accounts. The 
prospectuses for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts contain 
appropriate disclosure of this right.
    3. By a supplement to the prospectuses for the Contracts and the 
Separate Accounts, each Insurance Company has notified all owners of 
the Contracts of its intention to take the necessary actions, including 
seeking the order requested by this Application, to substitute shares 
of the funds as described herein. The supplement has advised Contract 
owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the 
proposed substitution, owners are permitted to make one transfer of 
Contract value (or annuity unit exchange) out of the Existing Fund sub-
account to one or more other sub-accounts without the transfer (or 
exchange) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted 
transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or 
exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge. The

[[Page 405]]

supplement also has informed Contract owners that the Insurance Company 
will not exercise any rights reserved under any Contract to impose 
additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after the 
proposed substitutions. The supplement has also advised Contract owners 
that for at least 30 days following the proposed substitutions, the 
Insurance Companies will permit Contract owners affected by the 
substitutions to make one transfer of Contract value (or annuity unit 
exchange) out of the Replacement Fund sub-account to one or more other 
sub-accounts without the transfer (or exchange) being treated as one of 
a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited 
number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge.
    4. The proposed substitutions will take place at relative net asset 
value with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's Contract 
value, cash value, or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or 
her investment in the Separate Accounts.
    5. The process for accomplishing the transfer of assets from each 
Existing Fund to its corresponding Replacement Fund will be determined 
on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, it is expected that the 
substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of an Existing Fund 
for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the Replacement Fund. 
In certain other cases, it is expected that the substitutions will be 
effected by redeeming the shares of an Existing Fund in-kind; those 
assets will then be contributed in-kind to the corresponding 
Replacement Fund to purchase shares of that Fund. All in-kind 
redemptions from an Existing Fund of which any of the Substitution 
Applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with 
the conditions set forth in the Commission's no-action letter issued to 
Signature Financial Group, Inc. (available December 28, 1999).
    6. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result 
of the proposed substitutions, nor will their rights or an Insurance 
Company's obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. All 
expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitutions, 
including brokerage, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses, 
will be paid by the Insurance Companies. In addition, the proposed 
substitutions will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners. The 
proposed substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges 
currently being paid by existing Contract owners to be greater after 
the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions. No 
fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed 
substitutions, because the proposed substitutions will not be treated 
as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for 
determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a Contract 
year.
    7. In addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to owners 
of Contracts, within five business days after the proposed 
substitutions are completed, Contract owners will be sent a written 
notice informing them that the substitutions were carried out and that 
they may make one transfer of all Contract value or cash value under a 
Contract invested in any one of the sub-accounts on the date of the 
notice to one or more other sub-accounts available under their Contract 
at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of 
transfers among sub-accounts or from the variable account options to 
the fixed account options. The notice will also reiterate that (other 
than with respect to ``market timing'' activity) the Insurance Company 
will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to 
impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on 
transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed substitutions. The 
Insurance Companies will also send each Contract owner current 
prospectuses for the Replacement Funds involved to the extent that they 
have not previously received a copy.
    8. Each Insurance Company also is seeking approval of the proposed 
substitutions from any State insurance regulators whose approval may be 
necessary or appropriate.
    9. The Substitution Applicants agree that for those who were 
Contract owners on the date of the proposed substitutions, the 
Insurance Companies will reimburse, on the last business day of each 
fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four 
months following the date of the proposed substitutions, those Contract 
owners whose sub-account invests in the Replacement Fund such that the 
sum of the Replacement Fund's net operating expenses (taking into 
account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and sub-account 
expenses (asset-based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from 
sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit 
values) for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the 
sum of the Existing Fund's net operating expenses taking into account 
fee waivers and expense reimbursements and sub-account expenses for 
fiscal year 2009, except with respect to the Delaware VIP Small Cap 
Value Series/Third Avenue Small Cap Value Portfolio, Janus Aspen Global 
Technology Portfolio/RCM Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason Global 
Currents Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio/MFS 
Research International Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable 
Diversified Strategic Income Portfolio/Western Asset Management 
Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset 
Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic 
Bond Opportunities Portfolio, Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund 
Portfolio, Templeton Growth Fund, Inc./Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio, 
and Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio 
substitutions.
    10. With respect to the Delaware VIP Small Cap Value Series/Third 
Avenue Small Cap Value Portfolio, Janus Aspen Global Technology 
Portfolio/RCM Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason Global Currents Variable 
International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio/MFS Research International 
Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic 
Income Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities 
Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio/
Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, 
Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund Portfolio substitutions, 
Templeton Growth Fund, Inc./Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio, and 
Templeton Growth Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio 
substitutions, the reimbursement agreement with respect to the 
Replacement Fund's operating expenses and sub-account expenses, will 
extend for the life of each Contract outstanding on the date of the 
proposed substitutions.
    11. The Substitution Applicants further agree that, except with 
respect to the Delaware VIP Small Cap Value Series/Third Avenue Small 
Cap Value Portfolio, Janus Aspen Global Technology Portfolio/RCM 
Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason Global Currents Variable International 
All Cap Opportunity Portfolio/MFS Research International Portfolio, 
Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic Income 
Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities 
Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio/
Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio,

[[Page 406]]

Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund Portfolio, Templeton Growth 
Fund, Inc./Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio and Templeton Growth 
Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio substitutions, the 
Insurance Companies will not increase total separate account charges 
(net of any reimbursements or waivers) for any existing owner of the 
Contracts on the date of the substitutions for a period of two years 
from the date of the substitutions.
    12. With respect to the Delaware VIP Small Cap Value Series/Third 
Avenue Small Cap Value Portfolio, Janus Aspen Global Technology 
Portfolio/RCM Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason Global Currents Variable 
International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio/MFS Research International 
Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic 
Income Portfolio/Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities 
Portfolio, Legg Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio/
Western Asset Management Strategic Bond Opportunities Portfolio, 
Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio/Pioneer Fund Portfolio, Templeton Growth 
Fund, Inc./Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio, and Templeton Growth 
Securities Fund/Met/Templeton Growth Portfolio substitutions, the 
agreement not to increase the separate account charges will extend for 
the life of each Contract outstanding on the date of the proposed 
substitutions.
    13. In each case, the applicable Insurance Companies believe that 
it is in the best interests of the Contract owners to substitute the 
Replacement Fund for the Existing Fund. The Insurance Companies believe 
that in cases where the Replacement Fund has a new sub-adviser, the new 
sub-adviser will, over the long term, be positioned to provide at least 
comparable performance to that of the Existing Fund's sub-adviser.
    14. The Substitution Applicants anticipate that Contract owners 
will be better off with the array of sub-accounts offered after the 
proposed substitutions than they have been with the array of sub-
accounts offered prior to the substitutions.
    15. The Substitution Applicants submit that none of the proposed 
substitutions is of the type that Section 26(c) was designed to 
prevent.
    16. The Substitution Applicants request an order of the Commission 
pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the proposed 
substitutions by the Insurance Companies.
    17. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) 
exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent 
necessary to permit the Insurance Companies to carry out each of the 
proposed substitutions.
    18. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any 
affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated 
person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any 
security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act 
generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principals, 
from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the 
registered company.
    19. Because shares held by a separate account of an insurance 
company are legally owned by the insurance company, the Insurance 
Companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially 
all of the shares of MIST and Met Series Fund. Therefore, MIST and Met 
Series Fund and their respective funds are arguably under the control 
of the Insurance Companies notwithstanding the fact that Contract 
owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in 
the Separate Accounts. If MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective 
funds are under the control of the Insurance Companies, then each 
Insurance Company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an 
affiliated person of MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective 
funds. If MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective funds are under 
the control of the Insurance Companies, then MIST and Met Series Fund 
and their respective funds are affiliated persons of the Insurance 
Companies.
    20. Regardless of whether or not the Insurance Companies can be 
considered to control MIST and Met Series Fund and their respective 
funds, because the Insurance Companies own of record more than 5% of 
the shares of each of them and are under common control with each 
Replacement Fund's investment adviser, the Insurance Companies are 
affiliated persons of both MIST and Met Series Fund and their 
respective funds. Likewise, their respective funds are each an 
affiliated person of the Insurance Companies.
    21. The Insurance Companies, through their separate accounts in the 
aggregate own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the following 
Existing Funds: Janus Aspen Global Technology Portfolio, Legg Mason 
Clearbridge Variable Capital Portfolio, Legg Mason Global Currents 
Variable International All Cap Opportunity Portfolio, Legg Mason 
Western Asset Variable Diversified Strategic Income Portfolio, Legg 
Mason Western Asset Variable Strategic Bond Portfolio, Pioneer Bond VCT 
Portfolio and Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio. Therefore, each Insurance 
Company is an affiliated person of those funds.
    22. Because the substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, 
by means of in-kind redemptions and purchases, the substitutions may be 
deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or 
property between affiliated persons. The proposed transactions may 
involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing Funds to the 
Insurance Companies; immediately thereafter, the Insurance Companies 
would purchase shares of the Replacement Funds with the portfolio 
securities received from the Existing Funds. Accordingly, as the 
Insurance Companies and certain of the Existing Funds listed above, and 
the Insurance Companies and the Replacement Funds, could be viewed as 
affiliated persons of one another under Section 2(a)(3) of the Act, it 
is conceivable that this aspect of the substitutions could be viewed as 
being prohibited by Section 17(a).
    23. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission may, upon 
application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the 
prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: (a) The 
terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be 
paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve 
overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed 
transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment 
company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records 
filed under the Act; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent 
with the general purposes of the Act.
    24. The Section 17 Applicants submit that for all the reasons 
stated above the terms of the proposed in-kind purchases of shares of 
the Replacement Funds by the Insurance Companies, including the 
consideration to be paid and received, as described in this 
Application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on 
the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants also submit 
that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Insurance Companies are 
consistent with the policies of: (a) MIST and of its Third Avenue Small 
Cap Value, RCM Technology, Met/Templeton Growth, MFS Research 
International, PIMCO Total Return, and Pioneer Fund Portfolios; and (b) 
Met Series Fund and of its Davis Venture Value, Western Asset 
Management Strategic Bond Opportunities and Van Eck Global Natural 
Resources Portfolios,

[[Page 407]]

as recited in the current registration statements and reports filed by 
each under the Act. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the 
proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the 
Act.
    25. To the extent that the in-kind purchases by the Insurance 
Company of the Replacement Funds' shares are deemed to involve 
principal transactions among affiliated persons, the procedures 
described below should be sufficient to assure that the terms of the 
proposed transactions are reasonable and fair to all participants. The 
Section 17 Applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed in-kind 
purchase transactions, including the consideration to be paid and 
received by each fund involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve 
overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all 
but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7. The proposed 
transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity 
with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 
thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's 
contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her 
investment in any of the Separate Accounts. Contract owners will not 
suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions. 
The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of 
the substitutions. Even though the Separate Accounts, the Insurance 
Companies, MIST and Met Series Fund may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the 
Section 17 Applicants believe that the Rule's conditions outline the 
type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and 
reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude 
overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated 
persons. In addition, as stated above, the in-kind redemptions will 
only be made in accordance with the conditions set out in the Signature 
Financial Group no-action letter (December 29, 1999).
    26. The boards of MIST and Met Series Fund have adopted procedures, 
as required by paragraph (e)(1) of Rule 17a-7, pursuant to which the 
series of each may purchase and sell securities to and from their 
affiliates. The Section 17 Applicants will carry out the proposed 
Insurance Company in-kind purchases in conformity with all of the 
conditions of Rule 17a-7 and each series' procedures thereunder, except 
that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold 
may not be entirely cash. Nevertheless, the circumstances surrounding 
the proposed substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of 
protection to each Replacement Fund from overreaching that Rule 17a-7 
provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale 
of securities under that Rule in the ordinary course of their business. 
In particular, the Insurance Companies (or any of their affiliates) 
cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is 
disadvantageous to any of the Replacement Funds. Although the 
transactions may not be entirely for cash, each will be effected based 
upon (1) the independent market price of the portfolio securities 
valued as specified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-7, and (2) the net 
asset value per share of each fund involved valued in accordance with 
the procedures disclosed in its respective investment company 
registration statement and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the Act. No 
brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid to any 
party in connection with the proposed in kind purchase transactions.
    27. The sale of shares of Replacement Funds for investment 
securities, as contemplated by the proposed Insurance Company in-kind 
purchases, is consistent with the investment policies and restrictions 
of the Investment Companies and the Replacement Funds because (a) the 
shares are sold at their net asset value, and (b) the portfolio 
securities are of the type and quality that the Replacement Funds would 
each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares 
been sold for cash. To assure that the second of these conditions is 
met, MetLife Advisers, LLC and the sub-adviser, as applicable, will 
examine the portfolio securities being offered to each Replacement Fund 
and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it 
would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction.
    28. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Insurance 
Company in-kind purchases are consistent with the general purposes of 
the Act as stated in the Findings and Declaration of Policy in Section 
1 of the Act and that the proposed transactions do not present any of 
the conditions or abuses that the Act was designed to prevent.
    29. The Section 17 Applicants request that the Commission issue an 
order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the Act exempting the Separate 
Accounts, the Insurance Companies, MIST, Met Series Fund and each 
Replacement Fund from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the Act to the 
extent necessary to permit the Insurance Companies on behalf of the 
Separate Accounts to carry out, as part of the substitutions, the in-
kind purchase of shares of the Replacement Funds which may be deemed to 
be prohibited by Section 17(a) of the Act.

Conclusion

    Applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the 
proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of 
Section 26(c) of the Act and are consistent with the standards of 
Section 17(b) of the Act and that the requested orders should be 
granted.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management 
pursuant to delegated authority.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
