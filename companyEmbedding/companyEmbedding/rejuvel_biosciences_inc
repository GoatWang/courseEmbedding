MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rejuvel 
      Bio-Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB: NUUU), a NASA Technology Transfer Partner 
      and creator of REJUVEL 
      3D Ageless Infinity Microgravity Cell Renewal Cream, announced today 
      that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rejuvel Int'l, Inc., has signed a new 
      distribution agreement with the Houboubati Group of Companies, based in 
      the United Arab Emirates.
    


      The agreement will make REJUVEL 3D skin cream available in Saudi Arabia, 
      Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
    

      “This agreement is a major step in our strategy of reaching customers 
      around the world and building a global brand,” said Charles 
      Scimeca, President of Rejuvel Bio-Sciences. “We also expect REJUVEL 
      3D to be especially successful in the dry and arid climate of the Middle 
      East because of its ability to increase skin moisturization.”
    

      The key ingredient in REJUVEL 3D is made by stem cells from a type of 
      green tea plant, Camellia sinensis, that are grown in a special 
      bioreactor developed by NASA engineers that mimics the microgravity 
      conditions of space. Because cells grow differently in microgravity, 
      they make far more of the 
      healing substances that are known to exist in green tea extract — 
      and they may make more potent substances as well.
    

      Dermatologists, facial experts and wellness center clients who have 
      tried the product report 
      amazing results. Wrinkles diminish. Dark blotches and nasty scars 
      fade. And dry flaky skin becomes moist and smooth.
    

      “We’re pleased that the Houboubati Group of Companies has recognized 
      that our product offers major advantages over competitors, thanks to the 
      unique science behind REJUVEL 3D,” said Scimeca.
    

      This agreement includes an initial order of $71,250. That represents the 
      largest single order to date for the product and underscores the 
      transition that Rejuvel Bio-Sciences, Inc. has made from a developmental 
      stage company to a company with growing revenues.

  Technology Applications International Corporation (NUUU) is focused on producing, distributing, marketing and selling anti-aging skincare products, in addition to engaging in the environmental management and water purification industries.           ^^^BADLY FAKED PHOTOSHOP ^^^ The company conducts its business through two separate wholly owned subsidiaries: Rejuvel Int'l, Inc. and NueEarth, Inc. NUUU’s management team is methodically establishing its brand in the marketplace with well-respected associations and strategic marketing initiatives. As the company continues to pursue direct consumer sales and other opportunities, it stands to do well with the foundation management has laid for growth. NUUU recently reached agreements with three shareholders, including the current CEO of the company, to exchange, or buy back and retire a total of 68,666,119 shares of common stock, which represents 57.86% of NUUU’s total outstanding shares. As a result, the company’s outstanding shares were reduced from roughly 118 million to 50 million.    NUUU: Rejuvel:            Investment Highlights  Operates through Two Established Subsidiaries 	Utilizing Patented NASA Technology 	Admitted into Space Certification Program 	Revolutionary Anti-Aging Skin Care Products 	Addressing Global Water Purification Concerns     Patented Technology The key manufacturing element to NUUU’s skin care product is the company’s use of the patented NASA Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor, licensed from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund under U.S. Patent No. 6,730,498. Representative of the depth of the NASA partnership, Melanie Saunders, associate director for the Johnson Space Center, in July, 2014, welcomed NUUU Chief Executive Officer Charles Scimeca to a ceremony to sign an additional exclusive patent license marking a continuing relationship between NASA and the cosmetic and personal care product company.  For a full report on this event, click here: From Cosmic to Cosmetics: NASA Bioreactor Technology Finds New Purpose Developing Beauty Products    Rejuvel Subsidiary  Revolutionary anti-aging facial cream created utilizing a NASA patented technology*   As we age, elasticity decreases, blotching and wrinkles appear. Our skin shows uneven skin tones and discoloration. Rejuvel’s latest product, RE’JUVEL, repairs your skin from within using products that counteract the effects of time with ingredients that restore its youth and resiliency.  Just exactly how RE’JUVEL counters the effects of aging is a matter of science. NASA scientists and astronauts in collaboration with other engineers developed a bioreactor tested in space and proven on earth. This device allows the growth and multiplication of plant and/or mammalian cells in simulated weightlessness. These cells are grown three-dimensionally, just like in the human body. The key ingredient in RE’JUVEL’s product formula is a blend of plant and mammalian 3D cell cultures that work on the cellular level to increase hydration, visibly reduce lines, wrinkles, and enhance skin health. These cells were all grown using NASA patented technology. Fibroblast skin cells are naturally found in the layers of human skin. The fibroblast cell’s function is to biosynthesize the connective tissue that provides structural support and plays a critical role in the skin’s healing process. Fibroblast cells are responsible for making collagens, elastic fibers and glycoproteins. The human body generates less fibroblast cells as it ages, thus creating wrinkles, sagging, and blemishes. RE’JUVEL’s formulation stimulates the growth of fibroblast cells, which keeps skin looking firmer longer. Clinical Product Study Technology Applications International Corporation completed a clinical study to test the efficacy of the RE’JUVEL product line at Essex Testing Clinic in Verona, New Jersey. Team members on The Essex Testing Clinic staff included doctors, nurses, clinical study, recruitment professionals, quality assurance and trained evaluators and a large network of consulting physicians, all possessing considerable experience in clinical investigation. After 6 weeks of product use, 32 subjects responded with the following:  100% – Smoother and softer skin. 	100% – Facial skin had an improved texture. 	100% – Product regimen was gentle and non-irritating. 	84.4% – Appearance of fine lines on face is less noticeable. 	78.1% – Appearance of wrinkles on face is less noticeable. 	81.3% – Improvement in the firmness/elasticity of skin. 	75.0% – Reduction in the appearance of dark, under the eye circles. 	84.4% – Skin appeared renewed and discolorations were reduced. 	87.5% – Moisture content in skin had increased. 	90.6% – Skin appears brighter and more radiant. 	90.6% – Skin appears healthier. 	93.8% – Skin appears refreshed. 	87.5% – Overall appearance was improved.  Scientific Measurements results after 6 weeks of use are as follows:  78% of subjects Fine Lines/ Wrinkles were significantly reduced 	88% of subjects Under Eye Discoloration significantly improved 	78% of subjects Firmness/ Elasticity significantly improved 	97% of subjects Skin Moisture significantly improved  Recent Highlights   Filmed with intent to air first 30-second television commercial in New York City at Windmill Studios to introduce and highlight REJUVEL's Breakthrough Facial Repair Crème.

Formed an Advisory Board, to which Dr. Jacob G. Appelbaum was appointed as chairman. Dr. Appelbaum is an internationally recognized physicist and multidisciplinary technologist with a broad spectrum of scientific interests and technological expertise, ranging from nanotechnology-based broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics to 3D suspended cell cultures in a simulated microgravity environment for cosmetics and regeneration medicine, as well as environmental and medical applications of electron beam accelerators and microwave assisted freeze drying, extraction and distillation  * Licensed from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund under U.S. Patent No. 6,730,498    NueEarth, Inc. Subsidiary   NueEarth provides environmental management solutions and water purification techniques using a mobile electron beam accelerator unit which creates high-energy electrons that produce free radicals in the wastewater to decompose organic compounds or pollutants. The company has identified a number of different markets for this particle accelerator technology, including the removal of pollutants from wastewater, drinking water, municipal sludge and water that’s contaminated by the fracking process. Industry There is an urgent demand for reuse of reclaimed municipal and industrial wastewater, as well as of remediation of water resources contaminated by industry and agriculture. A major problem in wastewater treatment is that industrial wastewaters are usually mixed with municipal wastewaters. Conventional drinking water treatment processes were not designed to remove trace quantities of pharmaceuticals, such as antibiotics and endocrine disrupting chemicals. Given the increasing number of reports of its presence in the environment, it is essential that alternative technologies be developed that can effectively degrade or remove these compounds.   One of the most promising alternative technologies is use of e-beam accelerators for purification of water through advanced oxidation/reduction process, which is induced by high-energy electrons blasted into biologically or chemically polluted water. E-beam treatment may be combined with other advanced oxidation techniques such as addition of ozone, (O3) which further enhances the effectiveness of the pollutant degradation. The key distinction of the e-beam treatment technology compared to various filter-based technologies is its advanced reduction-oxidation process induced by e-beam. It results in an ultimate destruction of dangerous chemicals in the treated medium, while passive filter-based technologies retain the unwanted contaminants removed from polluted water. However, using e-beam accelerators for chemical purification of drinking water, municipal and industrial wastewaters, is still considered an emerging technology despite multiple pilot plants and a few full-scale treatment facilities established around the world. The application of electron beam processing for drinking water, wastewater and groundwater treatment offers a cost effective process that insures adequate availability of that resource worldwide. Potable water is the cornerstone of development and essential for sustainable growth. The first consideration for drinking water is to produce water that has been disinfected. As mentioned above, the most common process is disinfection of drinking water by chlorine and some chlorination by- products may be carcinogenic or have other toxicological effects associated with consumption. Also, new pathogens are emerging that are not easily inactivated by chlorine. Therefore, the water treatment industry worldwide is eagerly trying to discover alternatives to disinfection by chlorine. In addition to disinfection, there is an increasing problem with the presence of toxic chemicals in source waters (waters used as sources of drinking water). These source waters may be surface waters or groundwater. Surface waters often are influenced by the discharge of treated wastewater and the biological and chemical quality compromised. Ground waters used as a source of drinking water may also be contaminated. In general, if the quality of groundwater is compromised, it is the result of chemical contamination. Waste water remediation by e-beam processing is promising due to a number of features that make this an attractive process for commercial application. Several advantages in the application of electron beam processing are:  Both oxidizing and reducing reactive species are formed in relatively the same proportion in aqueous media and then react with a pollutant. 	The e-beam remediation process can be used for simultaneous control of biological and chemical hazards. 	The e-beam process is a physical process and requires no additional chemicals. 	The process is extremely rapid, allowing for maximum flexibility in plant design and combination with more conventional wastewater pretreatment technologies. 	While similar in its mechanism of action to gamma ray processing, the e-beam process does not involve any nuclear materials. 	The electron accelerators only require electricity to operate. 	The systems are totally automated for ease of operation.  The underlying scientific basis for the application process to solving water pollution problems is as well established as any technology that is already in use. However, large scale commercialization of the e-beam technology has been relatively slow, so very few full-scale e-beam waste water treatment plants currently exist.     Space Certification  Awarded a “seal of approval” from the Space Certification program  The origin of NUUU’s RE’JUVEL product comes directly from technology and resources derived from the space program, which qualifies the company as a Certified Space Technology™ by the Space Foundation.

Fibroblast cells are crucial in the foundation of skin health. These cells are naturally found in the layers of human dermal tissue, performing a vital function by biosynthesizing the connective tissue that provides structural support and plays a critical role in the skin’s healing process. Fibroblast cells are also responsible for producing collagen, elastic fibers and glycoproteins, which are all critical elements of healthy, youthful skin. As we get older, the body produces fewer amounts of fibroblast cells, resulting in the key signs of aging such as wrinkles, sagging and dryness.  BIOMIMETIC SUSPENSION The benefits of REJUVEL 3D products begin with a bioreactor, developed by NASA scientists and engineers, which creates a suspended microgravity environment by using a rotating vessel to grow cell cultures. Experts found that this stress-free environment allowed the cell cultures to grow in a three-dimensional state, much like how cells grow in the human body. These cells are more equivalent to natural skin cells, and they were also exposed to an increased amount of nutrients and functioned in a more complete manner. The results unearthed a major skincare breakthrough when compared to commonly used two-dimensional methods, which force the cells to grow in a restrictive area, leaving them deformed and poorly functioning.  REJUVENATE WITH SCIENCE The biomolecules released by these potent 3D cell cultures are the key elements in REJUVEL 3D’s formulas. Our products work on the cellular level to restore youthful volume by stimulating fibroblast cells that encourage skin renewal. Clinically tested results show increased hydration, visible reduction of fine lines and wrinkles and enhanced overall skin health.  Rejuvel 3D has received a multitude of extremely positive reviews on blogs, amazon.com, 3rd party evaluators, and most importantly the company was able to sign a LOREAL Executive VP to their Advisory Board – Kat Peeler. See press release below. Note the date of the press release. It was confirmed by email that Kat Peeler is still with Rejuvel Bio-Sciences Advisory Board.  Rejuvel Bio-Sciences, Inc. Appoints Former Senior Vice President of Marketing at L’Oreal to Its Advisory Board MIAMI, FL–(Marketwired – Feb 9, 2016) – Rejuvel Bio-Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB: NUUU), a NASA Technology Transfer Partner and creator of REJUVEL 3D Ageless Infinity Microgravity Cell Renewal Cream, announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rejuvel Int’l, Inc., has appointed Kat Peeler to its advisory board. Peeler was a former Senior Vice President of L’Oreal, the EUR 23 billion multinational.  “Kat Peeler’s 17 year affiliation with L’Oreal will benefit us in developing our strategy of reaching customers around the world and building a global brand,” said Charles Scimeca, President of Rejuvel Bio-Sciences. The key ingredient in REJUVEL 3D is made from stem cells from a type of green tea plant, Camellia Sinensis, that are expanded in a special bioreactor developed by NASA engineers that mimics the microgravity conditions of space. This process greatly increases the activity of the cells that promotes your own body’s healing mechanisms. Because cells grow differently in microgravity, they make far more of the healing substances that are known to exist in green tea extract. Dermatologists, facial experts and wellness center clients who have tried the product report amazing results. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rejuvel-bio-sciences-inc-appoints-133000981.html    The very fact that NUUU has aboard in an advisory capacity a former 17 yr. Senior Executive of L’Oreal, speaks volumes to how efficacious this product/technology is. By the way, L’Oreal is the number #1 cosmetic company in the world and ranked #25 amongst all consumer brands worldwide.    https://www.rankingthebrands.com/Brand-detail.aspx?brandID=16   Lets talk about the otcmarkets.com and sec/edgar verified share structure for NUUU. Now, before you freak out and say 100 billion A/S, hear me out, because by definition the Authorized Shares is just a future number they are authorized to issue. The REALITY of the situation is that its just a number and not relevant to the current situation with the company and more importantly for any traders. It would be virtually impossible to issue 100 billion shares and have viable company. We expect the new CEO and CFO will dramatically reduce this number in some upcoming filings. Common sense prevails on this matter. But as we all know the most IMPORTANT number in a stock is the FLOAT. The float in NUUU is a confirmed and verified 680M. Now, for a triple zero stock that is a SEC filer, with a tremendous product/technology, new CEO and CFO in recent filings, and rumored a lot more filings to come to go current on quarterlies along with updates/news. Think about, when a new CEO and a new CFO are 8k SEC filed, it can mean only 1 thing….More filings to come along with news and updates as well.  https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/NUUU/profile Outstanding Shares 1,177,647,077 a/o Jun 14, 2017 Float 680,350,238 a/o Mar 01, 2017  Rejuvel AMAZON LINK:  https://www.amazon.com/Rejuvel-3D-Microgravity-Renewal-Cream/dp/B007T9XMZ0?th=1   Contact Info: Chase Bank Building  150 SE 2nd Ave  Suite 403  Miami, FL 33131  Phone: (800) 670-0448           OTCM STOP SIGN, DELINQUENT FILER, GAGGED TA, and                 100 BILLION A/S

The benefits of REJUVEL 3D products begin with a bioreactor, 
developed by NASA scientists and engineers, which creates a suspended 
microgravity environment by using a rotating vessel to grow cell 
cultures. Experts found that this stress-free environment allowed the 
cell cultures to grow in a three-dimensional state, much like how cells 
grow in the human body. These cells are more equivalent to natural skin 
cells, and they were also exposed to an increased amount of nutrients 
and functioned in a more complete manner. The results unearthed a major 
skincare breakthrough when compared to commonly used two-dimensional 
methods, which force the cells to grow in a restrictive area, leaving 
them deformed and poorly functioning.
Rejuvenate with Science
The biomolecules released by these potent 3D cell cultures are the 
key elements in REJUVEL 3D’s formulas. Our products work on the cellular
 level to restore youthful volume by stimulating fibroblast cells that 
encourage skin renewal. Clinically tested results show increased 
hydration, visible reduction of fine lines and wrinkles and enhanced 
overall skin health

Rejuvel Bio-Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB: NUUU), which trades at .59 per share , has recently taken several steps to shore up its global brand appeal, strengthening the foundation of an up-and-coming brand ready to break through as a household name.Rejuvel Bio-Sciences, Inc.'s flagship product is its REJUVEL 3D Microgravity Cell Renewal Cream, a state-of-the-art facial cream that uses bioreactor technology licensed from NASA. REJUVEL 3D burst onto the scene earlier in 2015 when it was included in the Academy Awards "swag bag," and continued its dominance of Hollywood when it was recently featured in Mother's Day celebrity gift boxes that found their way into the hands of some of the biggest stars in the world including Eva Mendes, Alicia Keys, and Kate Hudson.Last month the company received its CPNP Reference Number so that it can begin product distribution in the European Union and its member states. This will not only allow REJUVEL 3D to be sold in Europe, but the company's agreement also included directives allowing Rejuvel to take full advantage of home shopping television programming for its products.Building on the backbone of both this development and a unique, proprietary product, Rejuvel Bio-Sciences recently broadened its scope by entering into a distribution agreement with RJVL Ltd, based in the Ukraine, the largest country within Europe. Rejuvel' Vice-President, John Stickler, indicated: "Ukraine has a population of 45 million people and presents an incredible opportunity for us because they are familiar with NASA's scientific accomplishments."In addition to the company's progress in international markets, a closer look at a few stocks within personal care industries reveals a particularly promising outlook. A 9% drop in the first quarter for Elizabeth Arden (NASDAQ: RDEN) is revealing of a recent trend among cosmetics consumers to buck traditional product lines and marketing for cosmetics that offer an entirely new experience, such as Rejuvel's age-defying, NASA-licensed cream.Another such product is Revita, offered by DS Healthcare (DSKX) trading at 4.51. Revita is a hair regrowth treatment utilizing a completely new approach that targets multiple underlying hair loss triggers. The product is also known for its lack of scalp and skin irritation, and social media endorsements have helped DSKX see a significant spike in recent months.LifeVantage Corporation (LFVN), which takes an advanced, rounded approach to anti-aging and transformative health. The company makes and markets Protandim and Nrf2 Synergizer, two dietary supplements used to complement external sports-based health regiments created and studied by the company. By investigating all facets of health and wellness while supplementing exercise regiments with its skin care regiments an other health products, LifeVantage capitalizes on several untapped aspects of the personal care market.The new wave of cosmetics and personal care companies like NUUU and LFVN stand poised to supplant some of the larger players incapable of adapting to advances in research, science, and marketing. With its celebrity associations and a fast track on the international market, NUUU in particular stands apart from the crowd, offering investors a company whose global interests make it primed for possible success.DISCLAIMER:Seraphim Strategies is a third party publisher.

Most Innovative Formula of 2015

Rejuvel 3D has been awarded “Most Innovative Formula of 2015” by Accord Media’s Truth In Aging” publication. Truth In Aging has been online since 2008 and was founded and is headed by Marta Wohrle. Marta’s mission through the Truth In Aging website is to offer truthful and unbiased guidance to people seeking to improve their physical health and appearance through skin care, hair care, health and beauty products, and salon and clinical treatments.
 
[perfectpullquote align=”full” class=”” cite=”Marta Wohrle, Truth In Aging” link=”” color=”#365088″]”I try to bring a uniquely curious and honest voice to help consumers, through my website.”[/perfectpullquote]
About Us
Rejuvel Bio-Sciences, Inc. (NUUU), the parent company of Rejuvel Int’l, Inc., has created REJUVEL 3D, which is based on technology developed by NASA to grow cells in an environment that mimics the near weightlessness of space.
REJUVEL 3D is the first ever three-dimensional skin renewal system using NASA patented technology, exclusively licensed from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund under U.S. Patent Nos. 6,730,498 and 6,485,963 B1 and 6,673,597 B2. This technology allows for REJUVEL 3D to be produced with an ingredient that has anti-aging properties found in no other product.
The story of Rejuvel begins with experiments in space. One of the problems that must be solved before humans can travel to distant planets or stars is how to treat the inevitable wounds and diseases that astronauts will get. Was it possible to grow cells in space that might be able to provide, say, replacement skin or organs, NASA researchers asked?
Well, not only was the growing of cells possible, astronauts discovered that the cells also grow better in the microgravity of space than they do on Earth, forming three-dimensional structures instead of just spreading across a flat surface. The difference was so striking, that researchers at Johnson Space Center, along with Tulane University’s scientists, including astronaut Dr. David Wolf and inventor Thomas Goodwin, wondered if the benefits could also be achieved on the ground. They designed a rotating cylinder, dubbed a rotating wall vessel bioreactor, that keeps the cells and the growth medium suspended within the device, to try and mimic the microgravity of space.
The idea worked. The researchers were able to expand everything from human kidney and lung cells to human fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are a type of cell found in connective tissue that makes collagen, a key protein in skin and other substances that aid in skin and tissue repair.
Moreover, the fibroblasts grown in microgravity increased collagen and other regenerative substances. The scientists realized that the substances could be used in applications that would heal and rejuvenate skin. They patented the rotating wall bioreactor and the various fields of use.
Former NASA employees started a company to develop various uses of the bioreactor but struggled. Rejuvel saw the promise of the bioreactor technology and decided to bring the product to market after licensing the patents from NASA.
In order to find the most effective candidate ingredients, they looked at a variety of cells and determined that of those which could be extracted from plants, an ideal candidate was a type of green tea called “Camellia.”
Sinensis cells taken from the “callus” that the tea plant makes to cover a wound, turned out to grow beautifully in the bioreactor and because callus cells resemble stem cells (which can become any part of the plant), they produce a wider variety of growth factors and other substances than a typical green tea leaf cell.
Green tea extract has already been shown to have many health benefits, including anti-aging properties, and natural UV ray sun protection. Among other substances, it contains scores of compounds called flavonoids, which are known to have anti-inflammatory and other properties and which can help skin cells recover from sun damage and other injuries. So it’s no surprise that many skin care products already contain extracts from the plant.
But Rejuvel’s bioreactor, using the green tea callus cells, appears to make a much more potent and effective extract than is found in any other products. They culture the cells differently, using NASA patented technology to do so, and their extract has more active components. The extract is added to various creams mixed with a proprietary formula. The first product to come to market is REJUVEL 3D, in reference to the three-dimensional cell culture in the NASA-developed bioreactor.
“No other cosmetic manufacturer has what we have,” says Charles Scimeca, CEO and President of Rejuvel.

REJUVEL 3D has been created as a direct result of space technology which has been inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame.

For more information about Rejuvel’s relationship with NASA, please enjoy the following links:
NASA has a program called the “Technology Transfer Program: Bringing NASA Technology Down To Earth.” They publish an annual online magazine called “Spinoff.” We were featured in the 2015 edition. You can see the article written about us by NASA at this link.
In August 2014, representatives from our company traveled to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX to renew our licensing agreement with NASA. Afterwards, we were featured in an article at this link on the nasa.gov website as well as an article on the CosmeticsDesign.com website.

They designed a rotating cylinder, dubbed a rotating wall vessel bioreactor, that keeps the cells and the growth medium suspended within the device, to try and mimic the microgravity of space.
The idea worked. The researchers were able to expand everything from human kidney and lung cells to human fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are a type of cell found in connective tissue that makes collagen, a key protein in skin and other substances that aid in skin and tissue repair.
Moreover, the fibroblasts grown in microgravity increased collagen and other regenerative substances. The scientists realized that the substances could be used in applications that would heal and rejuvenate skin. They patented the rotating wall bioreactor and the various fields of use.
Former NASA employees started a company to develop various uses of the bioreactor but struggled. Rejuvel saw the promise of the bioreactor technology and decided to bring the product to market after licensing the patents from NASA.
In order to find the most effective candidate ingredients, they looked at a variety of cells and determined that of those which could be extracted from plants, an ideal candidate was a type of green tea called “Camellia.”
Sinensis cells taken from the “callus” that the tea plant makes to cover a wound, turned out to grow beautifully in the bioreactor and because callus cells resemble stem cells (which can become any part of the plant), they produce a wider variety of growth factors and other substances than a typical green tea leaf cell.
Green tea extract has already been shown to have many health benefits, including anti-aging properties, and natural UV ray sun protection. Among other substances, it contains scores of compounds called flavonoids, which are known to have anti-inflammatory and other properties and which can help skin cells recover from sun damage and other injuries. So it’s no surprise that many skin care products already contain extracts from the plant.
But Rejuvel’s bioreactor, using the green tea callus cells, appears to make a much more potent and effective extract than is found in any other products. They culture the cells differently, using NASA patented technology to do so, and their extract has more active components. The extract is added to various creams mixed with a proprietary formula. The first product to come to market is REJUVEL 3D, in reference to the three-dimensional cell culture in the NASA-developed bioreactor.
“No other cosmetic manufacturer has what we have,” says Charles Scimeca, CEO and President of Rejuvel.

REJUVEL 3D has been created as a direct result of space technology which has been inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame.

Thank you for the best product. I want to use it forever!




I’ve used so many skin products it’s insane. And I have to say for the value, this one might be the champion. It feels great on the eyes, and most of all the results speak for themselves. I have periodic swelling around my face that makes me look puffy but after applying this product it goes down quite a bit. I enjoy feeling like I have something like this in my back pocket in case some stuff goes down on my face.

- Denise Green


This stuff is incredible. i love the texture. it is so smooth-feeling when you’re applying it, but it doesn’t feel too thick and BOY does it moisturize. it never looks or feels greasy. my skin looks so fresh and bright as soon as i apply this. i have tried and used SO MANY different brands or moisturizers and this is one of my all-time favorites.

- Vanessa


I have tried everything to tackle hormonal acne and I can’t believe not one cystic monster this month!!! Usually have 5 painful large cystic acne and small white pimples every month for years. This cream is a miracle. I worked in cosmetics for 20 years and not even $500 creams can compare to how quickly Rejuvel worked. Hooray for space cream! Can’t wait to see what other products come out. Client for life!! :)

- Amy


I Love this product! I bought my 1st bottle from Dr. Barr in West Palm this past winter and it is definitely the best product I have ever tried (and I have tried MANY). I get so many compliments on my skin and so many people ask what I am doing/using. I am having a problem ordering and hope to get a response soon about this as I don’t know how much I have left….and that is the other issue..how do I know how much is left?

(  OTC PINK :  NUUU ) is a NASA Technology Transfer Partner and creator of REJUVEL 3D Ageless Infinity Microgravity Cell Renewal Cream. Rejuvel is the only company in the world to exclusively use patented NASA technology licensed from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund under U.S. Patent Nos. 6,730,498 and 6,485,963 B1 and 6,673,597 B2 to manufacture topical cosmetics and hair care products.Rejuvel announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rejuvel Int'l, Inc., has received its first order from a newly formed relationship with Digicom, an Istanbul based retailer of consumer and cosmetics goods. This order represents Rejuvel's continuing and growing presence in the personal goods and cosmetics markets in Eastern Europe."We look forward to developing the relationship with Digicom, a multi-faceted Turkish company, and to continue to register and sell our products in various countries around the world. We see Rejuvel as a worldwide brand that can help people everywhere achieve better looking skin by using our products. In other developments, we are working towards filing the proper SEC documents to regain our fully reporting status," said Charles Scimeca, President of Rejuvel.The Company also announced that it recently met with an International Trade Specialist at the U.S. Commercial Service which is an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and also met with the Regional Director of the Eastern Region of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The U.S. Commercial Service, whose website is at www.trade.gov, assists and guides small and medium sized American companies through the product export process into most countries around the world. Rejuvel is looking forward to receiving sales leads though the agency's listing website and is also exploring ways of providing credit to its overseas customers, through The Export-Import Bank of the United States, which it believes will lead to larger orders and more sales revenue.Rejuvel creates one of the most unique anti-aging face creams in the world. The key ingredient in REJUVEL 3D is derived from the stem cells of a type of green tea plant, Camellia Sinensis, that are expanded in a special bioreactor developed by NASA engineers which mimics the microgravity conditions of outer space. This process greatly increases the activity of the cells and promotes your body's own healing mechanisms. Because cells grow differently in microgravity, the potency of these cells is far superior to that of cells grown using traditional methods. Dermatologists, facial experts, wellness center clients and our customers that have tried our Rejuvel 3D product report amazing results. Rejuvel has recently been awarded the bronze medal in the Truth In Aging Olympics: MVP category. Previously, Truth In Aging had awarded Rejuvel its Most Innovative Formula of 2015 award.For more information about NUUU please visit the corporate website at: www.rejuvel.com.Notice Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This news release contains forward-looking information within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements that include the words "believes," "expects," "anticipate" or similar expressions.

SCIENCE


Experience a scientific breakthrough with REJUVEL 3D, the first ever three-dimensional skin renewal system using exclusively licensed NASA patented technology*. The science behind our products originates from Space Certified Technology, developed by astronauts, studied by doctors and formulated to provide highly advanced skin renewal results.
*Licensed from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund under U.S. Patent Nos. 6,730,498 and 6,485,963 B1 and 6,673,597 B2.
Why Does Skin Age?
Fibroblast cells are crucial in the foundation of skin health. These cells are naturally found in the layers of human dermal tissue, performing a vital function by biosynthesizing the connective tissue that provides structural support and plays a critical role in the skin’s healing process. Fibroblast cells are also responsible for producing collagen, elastic fibers and glycoproteins, which are all critical elements of healthy, youthful skin. As we get older, the body produces fewer amounts of fibroblast cells, resulting in the key signs of aging such as wrinkles, sagging and dryness.
Biomimetic Suspension
The benefits of REJUVEL 3D products begin with a bioreactor, developed by NASA scientists and engineers, which creates a suspended microgravity environment by using a rotating vessel to grow cell cultures. Experts found that this stress-free environment allowed the cell cultures to grow in a three-dimensional state, much like how cells grow in the human body. These cells are more equivalent to natural skin cells, and they were also exposed to an increased amount of nutrients and functioned in a more complete manner. The results unearthed a major skincare breakthrough when compared to commonly used two-dimensional methods, which force the cells to grow in a restrictive area, leaving them deformed and poorly functioning.
Rejuvenate with Science
The biomolecules released by these potent 3D cell cultures are the key elements in REJUVEL 3D’s formulas. Our products work on the cellular level to restore youthful volume by stimulating fibroblast cells that encourage skin renewal. Clinically tested results show increased hydration, visible reduction of fine lines and wrinkles and enhanced overall skin health.
