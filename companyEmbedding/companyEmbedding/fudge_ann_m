Early life and education[edit]
Fudge was born and raised in Washington, DC and attended the city's Catholic schools[1] through 12th grade. "She cited the riots she lived through after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a 'hurtful' but formative experience. 'They made me incredibly determined,' she said. 'I wanted to do something that black people hadn't done before. When I hit roadblocks, that was what kept me going.' ... She grew up middle class in Washington, the first of two children born to a mother who was a manager at the National Security Agency and a father who was an administrator at the Postal Service. They stressed education ... and [Fudge also] credits the nuns for pushing her to do her best."[2]
Fudge is a graduate of Simmons College and Harvard Business School,[3] earning respectively BA (honors) in retail management, 1973; and MBA, 1977.[1] In 1998, HBS Prof. Stephen A. Greyser recalled Fudge as "a solid citizen, a solid student."[2]
Discussing her educational choices with Business Week in 2004, she said "When I was at Simmons College, I had this great professor -- Margaret Hennig. She was the one who encouraged me to think about business and apply to Harvard Business School. She and Ann Jardim wrote the first book on women in business, called The Managerial Woman, and founded the Simmons Graduate School of Business. I applied to Harvard Business School my senior year."[4]
Career[edit]
One job Fudge had while still in high school was with the Teen Board[5] at Hecht's department store. The job included advising on teen-age fashions and a trip to fashion magazines in New York. After college, Fudge worked in the human resources department of the General Electric Company before pursuing her MBA.[2]
After Harvard, Fudge spent nine years at General Mills.[6] "Her biggest accomplishment there, she said, was her part as a marketing assistant on the team that developed Honey Nut Cheerios. Today, it's one of the nation's biggest cereal brands."[2] Fudge then served, ultimately, as president of the beverages, desserts and Post division, a $5 billion unit of Kraft Foods. At Kraft, she served on the management committee and managed many businesses including Maxwell House coffee, Gevalia kaffe, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, Post Cereals, Jell-O desserts, and Altoids.[6]
In 1998, Fudge was named by Fortune magazine as 30th on the 50 Most Influential Women in American Business list (Carly Fiorina #1 Oprah Winfrey #2), while she was executive vice president at Kraft. At the time, coffee and cereals for which Fudge was responsible accounted for $2.7 billion (16%) of Kraft's $16.8 billion in sales. She also at the time sat on the boards of AlliedSignal, Liz Claiborne, (both as of 1993[2]) and Catalyst, Inc.[7][8]
In 2001, after a year as president of the beverages et al. division at Kraft, "Fudge decided to retire. She related to Business Week that her choice to leave Kraft was based on a number of reasons. She had had a goal of retiring before age 50; she had dealt with the recent illness and death of her parents, some close friends and relatives. 'To be honest, I still haven't figured it out. ... It was definitely not dissatisfaction. It was stepping back and saying, "What are you really here for? What do you really want to accomplish?"' She spent two years reconnecting with friends and family and delving into community work. Her charitable work included work with a number of organizations, including the Executive Leadership Council, a non-profit group of high-level African-American leaders in business, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and the United Way, among others. From her time away, Fudge became inspired by the power individuals have to make a difference in the world."[1]
Following the sabbatical, Fudge served as chair and chief executive officer of Young & Rubicam Brands from 2003 to 2007. In 2004, Business Week summed up some of the challenges facing her, saying Y&R "has suffered through poor management and a messy merger in recent years. The various units tend to work in isolation. The ad agency has lost some big clients. And employees are disgruntled ... [including] reports of animosity between Fudge and creative head Michael Patti."[3][4]
Fudge was Inside the Boardroom guest, 2008, Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.
In February 2011, Fudge was featured by the Commonwealth Institute in Miami, Florida,[9] and in April 2011, Fudge spoke at the Economic Club of Minnesota.[10]
As of 2011, Fudge served on the boards of directors of General Electric, Novartis, and Unilever.[10] She also served as chair of the U.S. Programs Advisory Board of The Gates Foundation; and she was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation, Brookings Institution,[11] the Council on Foreign Relations and Morehouse College.[6] She has been a Morehouse trustee since April 2006.[3] She has also served on the board of Buzzient, Inc, and served as vice chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers.[12]
In June 2011, it was announced that Fudge would join the board of Indian technology and outsourcing company Infosys on October 1, 2011, as an Additional Director.[12] Fudge was at the time the sole woman on the board, and was recruited by retiring founder NR Narayana Murthy and nominations committee chair Jeffrey S. Lehman. Murthy had served also on the Unilever board and knew Fudge from there.[13]
In September 2011, Fudge was one of six Hall of Fame honorees named in advance of the National Association of Corporate Directors November gala in New York City.[14][15]
Political involvement and public service[edit]
In 2008, Fudge was a member of the Obama presidential campaign’s finance committee.[16]
In early 2010, Fudge was named by President Obama to the 18-member National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, a bipartisan panel chaired by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, (R-WY), and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles (D). The balance of the panel was three more members appointed by the President, six members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and six members of the U.S. Senate. The commission first met on April 27, 2010[17] and had a December report deadline. Though specific actions based on the report were limited, commission members who were also members of Congress reappeared in the so-called Gang of Six in spring and summer, 2011, in the debt-ceiling-increase debate.[18][19]
In September 2010, Fudge was listed as one of several possible candidates to replace Larry Summers as director of the National Economic Council.[20] Some reports signalled that the White House could be looking for a female executive with business experience to fill the post.[21][22]
In September 2011, Fudge joined in the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) "Go Big" forum. CRFB, along with the New America Foundation, the Concord Coalition, and the Bipartisan Policy Center "discuss[ed] the path ahead for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (Super Committee) and the reasons it should exceed its mandate".[23]
Fudge also serves on the State Department's Foreign Affairs Policy Board.[24]
Personal life[edit]
As a sophomore at Simmons, Ann married Rich Fudge. Before she graduated, they had a baby, Rich Jr. She had to balance personal and academic/professional demands from that early stage on. "Her fondest memory from General Mills ... involved her younger son, Kevin, then 9. Ms. Fudge had just been made a marketing director, the first woman and the first black at that level. 'I came home all excited, and was telling my family, and he said: "What's the big deal, mom? So now instead of one brand, you have four. You can do that." He was right. My sons have helped keep things in perspective.'"[2]
Fudge is also noted for having pursued her career despite the glass ceiling which has been seen to thwart promotion to the top ranks, facing women and minorities in the corporate workforce particularly.[2] And, in regards Fudge's relatively early moves out of jobs, the 2004 Business Week article also included a sidebar on four "other women [who] left high-powered positions in the corporate world to find a place where they could work on their own terms."[25]
Fudge is currently based in Chestnut Hill, MA.[6] She and her husband have five grandchildren.[10]

Early life and education[edit]
Fudge was born and raised in Washington, DC and attended the city's Catholic schools[1] through 12th grade. "She cited the riots she lived through after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a 'hurtful' but formative experience. 'They made me incredibly determined,' she said. 'I wanted to do something that black people hadn't done before. When I hit roadblocks, that was what kept me going.' ... She grew up middle class in Washington, the first of two children born to a mother who was a manager at the National Security Agency and a father who was an administrator at the Postal Service. They stressed education ... and [Fudge also] credits the nuns for pushing her to do her best."[2]
Fudge is a graduate of Simmons College and Harvard Business School,[3] earning respectively BA (honors) in retail management, 1973; and MBA, 1977.[1] In 1998, HBS Prof. Stephen A. Greyser recalled Fudge as "a solid citizen, a solid student."[2]
Discussing her educational choices with Business Week in 2004, she said "When I was at Simmons College, I had this great professor -- Margaret Hennig. She was the one who encouraged me to think about business and apply to Harvard Business School. She and Ann Jardim wrote the first book on women in business, called The Managerial Woman, and founded the Simmons Graduate School of Business. I applied to Harvard Business School my senior year."[4]
Career[edit]
One job Fudge had while still in high school was with the Teen Board[5] at Hecht's department store. The job included advising on teen-age fashions and a trip to fashion magazines in New York. After college, Fudge worked in the human resources department of the General Electric Company before pursuing her MBA.[2]
After Harvard, Fudge spent nine years at General Mills.[6] "Her biggest accomplishment there, she said, was her part as a marketing assistant on the team that developed Honey Nut Cheerios. Today, it's one of the nation's biggest cereal brands."[2] Fudge then served, ultimately, as president of the beverages, desserts and Post division, a $5 billion unit of Kraft Foods. At Kraft, she served on the management committee and managed many businesses including Maxwell House coffee, Gevalia kaffe, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, Post Cereals, Jell-O desserts, and Altoids.[6]
In 1998, Fudge was named by Fortune magazine as 30th on the 50 Most Influential Women in American Business list (Carly Fiorina #1 Oprah Winfrey #2), while she was executive vice president at Kraft. At the time, coffee and cereals for which Fudge was responsible accounted for $2.7 billion (16%) of Kraft's $16.8 billion in sales. She also at the time sat on the boards of AlliedSignal, Liz Claiborne, (both as of 1993[2]) and Catalyst, Inc.[7][8]
In 2001, after a year as president of the beverages et al. division at Kraft, "Fudge decided to retire. She related to Business Week that her choice to leave Kraft was based on a number of reasons. She had had a goal of retiring before age 50; she had dealt with the recent illness and death of her parents, some close friends and relatives. 'To be honest, I still haven't figured it out. ... It was definitely not dissatisfaction. It was stepping back and saying, "What are you really here for? What do you really want to accomplish?"' She spent two years reconnecting with friends and family and delving into community work. Her charitable work included work with a number of organizations, including the Executive Leadership Council, a non-profit group of high-level African-American leaders in business, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and the United Way, among others. From her time away, Fudge became inspired by the power individuals have to make a difference in the world."[1]
Following the sabbatical, Fudge served as chair and chief executive officer of Young & Rubicam Brands from 2003 to 2007. In 2004, Business Week summed up some of the challenges facing her, saying Y&R "has suffered through poor management and a messy merger in recent years. The various units tend to work in isolation. The ad agency has lost some big clients. And employees are disgruntled ... [including] reports of animosity between Fudge and creative head Michael Patti."[3][4]
Fudge was Inside the Boardroom guest, 2008, Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.
In February 2011, Fudge was featured by the Commonwealth Institute in Miami, Florida,[9] and in April 2011, Fudge spoke at the Economic Club of Minnesota.[10]
As of 2011, Fudge served on the boards of directors of General Electric, Novartis, and Unilever.[10] She also served as chair of the U.S. Programs Advisory Board of The Gates Foundation; and she was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation, Brookings Institution,[11] the Council on Foreign Relations and Morehouse College.[6] She has been a Morehouse trustee since April 2006.[3] She has also served on the board of Buzzient, Inc, and served as vice chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers.[12]
In June 2011, it was announced that Fudge would join the board of Indian technology and outsourcing company Infosys on October 1, 2011, as an Additional Director.[12] Fudge was at the time the sole woman on the board, and was recruited by retiring founder NR Narayana Murthy and nominations committee chair Jeffrey S. Lehman. Murthy had served also on the Unilever board and knew Fudge from there.[13]
In September 2011, Fudge was one of six Hall of Fame honorees named in advance of the National Association of Corporate Directors November gala in New York City.[14][15]
Political involvement and public service[edit]
In 2008, Fudge was a member of the Obama presidential campaign’s finance committee.[16]
In early 2010, Fudge was named by President Obama to the 18-member National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, a bipartisan panel chaired by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, (R-WY), and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles (D). The balance of the panel was three more members appointed by the President, six members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and six members of the U.S. Senate. The commission first met on April 27, 2010[17] and had a December report deadline. Though specific actions based on the report were limited, commission members who were also members of Congress reappeared in the so-called Gang of Six in spring and summer, 2011, in the debt-ceiling-increase debate.[18][19]
In September 2010, Fudge was listed as one of several possible candidates to replace Larry Summers as director of the National Economic Council.[20] Some reports signalled that the White House could be looking for a female executive with business experience to fill the post.[21][22]
In September 2011, Fudge joined in the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) "Go Big" forum. CRFB, along with the New America Foundation, the Concord Coalition, and the Bipartisan Policy Center "discuss[ed] the path ahead for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (Super Committee) and the reasons it should exceed its mandate".[23]
Fudge also serves on the State Department's Foreign Affairs Policy Board.[24]
Personal life[edit]
As a sophomore at Simmons, Ann married Rich Fudge. Before she graduated, they had a baby, Rich Jr. She had to balance personal and academic/professional demands from that early stage on. "Her fondest memory from General Mills ... involved her younger son, Kevin, then 9. Ms. Fudge had just been made a marketing director, the first woman and the first black at that level. 'I came home all excited, and was telling my family, and he said: "What's the big deal, mom? So now instead of one brand, you have four. You can do that." He was right. My sons have helped keep things in perspective.'"[2]
Fudge is also noted for having pursued her career despite the glass ceiling which has been seen to thwart promotion to the top ranks, facing women and minorities in the corporate workforce particularly.[2] And, in regards Fudge's relatively early moves out of jobs, the 2004 Business Week article also included a sidebar on four "other women [who] left high-powered positions in the corporate world to find a place where they could work on their own terms."[25]
Fudge is currently based in Chestnut Hill, MA.[6] She and her husband have five grandchildren.[10]

Early life and education[edit]
Fudge was born and raised in Washington, DC and attended the city's Catholic schools[1] through 12th grade. "She cited the riots she lived through after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a 'hurtful' but formative experience. 'They made me incredibly determined,' she said. 'I wanted to do something that black people hadn't done before. When I hit roadblocks, that was what kept me going.' ... She grew up middle class in Washington, the first of two children born to a mother who was a manager at the National Security Agency and a father who was an administrator at the Postal Service. They stressed education ... and [Fudge also] credits the nuns for pushing her to do her best."[2]
Fudge is a graduate of Simmons College and Harvard Business School,[3] earning respectively BA (honors) in retail management, 1973; and MBA, 1977.[1] In 1998, HBS Prof. Stephen A. Greyser recalled Fudge as "a solid citizen, a solid student."[2]
Discussing her educational choices with Business Week in 2004, she said "When I was at Simmons College, I had this great professor -- Margaret Hennig. She was the one who encouraged me to think about business and apply to Harvard Business School. She and Ann Jardim wrote the first book on women in business, called The Managerial Woman, and founded the Simmons Graduate School of Business. I applied to Harvard Business School my senior year."[4]
Career[edit]
One job Fudge had while still in high school was with the Teen Board[5] at Hecht's department store. The job included advising on teen-age fashions and a trip to fashion magazines in New York. After college, Fudge worked in the human resources department of the General Electric Company before pursuing her MBA.[2]
After Harvard, Fudge spent nine years at General Mills.[6] "Her biggest accomplishment there, she said, was her part as a marketing assistant on the team that developed Honey Nut Cheerios. Today, it's one of the nation's biggest cereal brands."[2] Fudge then served, ultimately, as president of the beverages, desserts and Post division, a $5 billion unit of Kraft Foods. At Kraft, she served on the management committee and managed many businesses including Maxwell House coffee, Gevalia kaffe, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, Post Cereals, Jell-O desserts, and Altoids.[6]
In 1998, Fudge was named by Fortune magazine as 30th on the 50 Most Influential Women in American Business list (Carly Fiorina #1 Oprah Winfrey #2), while she was executive vice president at Kraft. At the time, coffee and cereals for which Fudge was responsible accounted for $2.7 billion (16%) of Kraft's $16.8 billion in sales. She also at the time sat on the boards of AlliedSignal, Liz Claiborne, (both as of 1993[2]) and Catalyst, Inc.[7][8]
In 2001, after a year as president of the beverages et al. division at Kraft, "Fudge decided to retire. She related to Business Week that her choice to leave Kraft was based on a number of reasons. She had had a goal of retiring before age 50; she had dealt with the recent illness and death of her parents, some close friends and relatives. 'To be honest, I still haven't figured it out. ... It was definitely not dissatisfaction. It was stepping back and saying, "What are you really here for? What do you really want to accomplish?"' She spent two years reconnecting with friends and family and delving into community work. Her charitable work included work with a number of organizations, including the Executive Leadership Council, a non-profit group of high-level African-American leaders in business, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and the United Way, among others. From her time away, Fudge became inspired by the power individuals have to make a difference in the world."[1]
Following the sabbatical, Fudge served as chair and chief executive officer of Young & Rubicam Brands from 2003 to 2007. In 2004, Business Week summed up some of the challenges facing her, saying Y&R "has suffered through poor management and a messy merger in recent years. The various units tend to work in isolation. The ad agency has lost some big clients. And employees are disgruntled ... [including] reports of animosity between Fudge and creative head Michael Patti."[3][4]
Fudge was Inside the Boardroom guest, 2008, Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.
In February 2011, Fudge was featured by the Commonwealth Institute in Miami, Florida,[9] and in April 2011, Fudge spoke at the Economic Club of Minnesota.[10]
As of 2011, Fudge served on the boards of directors of General Electric, Novartis, and Unilever.[10] She also served as chair of the U.S. Programs Advisory Board of The Gates Foundation; and she was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation, Brookings Institution,[11] the Council on Foreign Relations and Morehouse College.[6] She has been a Morehouse trustee since April 2006.[3] She has also served on the board of Buzzient, Inc, and served as vice chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers.[12]
In June 2011, it was announced that Fudge would join the board of Indian technology and outsourcing company Infosys on October 1, 2011, as an Additional Director.[12] Fudge was at the time the sole woman on the board, and was recruited by retiring founder NR Narayana Murthy and nominations committee chair Jeffrey S. Lehman. Murthy had served also on the Unilever board and knew Fudge from there.[13]
In September 2011, Fudge was one of six Hall of Fame honorees named in advance of the National Association of Corporate Directors November gala in New York City.[14][15]
Political involvement and public service[edit]
In 2008, Fudge was a member of the Obama presidential campaign’s finance committee.[16]
In early 2010, Fudge was named by President Obama to the 18-member National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, a bipartisan panel chaired by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, (R-WY), and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles (D). The balance of the panel was three more members appointed by the President, six members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and six members of the U.S. Senate. The commission first met on April 27, 2010[17] and had a December report deadline. Though specific actions based on the report were limited, commission members who were also members of Congress reappeared in the so-called Gang of Six in spring and summer, 2011, in the debt-ceiling-increase debate.[18][19]
In September 2010, Fudge was listed as one of several possible candidates to replace Larry Summers as director of the National Economic Council.[20] Some reports signalled that the White House could be looking for a female executive with business experience to fill the post.[21][22]
In September 2011, Fudge joined in the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) "Go Big" forum. CRFB, along with the New America Foundation, the Concord Coalition, and the Bipartisan Policy Center "discuss[ed] the path ahead for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (Super Committee) and the reasons it should exceed its mandate".[23]
Fudge also serves on the State Department's Foreign Affairs Policy Board.[24]
Personal life[edit]
As a sophomore at Simmons, Ann married Rich Fudge. Before she graduated, they had a baby, Rich Jr. She had to balance personal and academic/professional demands from that early stage on. "Her fondest memory from General Mills ... involved her younger son, Kevin, then 9. Ms. Fudge had just been made a marketing director, the first woman and the first black at that level. 'I came home all excited, and was telling my family, and he said: "What's the big deal, mom? So now instead of one brand, you have four. You can do that." He was right. My sons have helped keep things in perspective.'"[2]
Fudge is also noted for having pursued her career despite the glass ceiling which has been seen to thwart promotion to the top ranks, facing women and minorities in the corporate workforce particularly.[2] And, in regards Fudge's relatively early moves out of jobs, the 2004 Business Week article also included a sidebar on four "other women [who] left high-powered positions in the corporate world to find a place where they could work on their own terms."[25]
Fudge is currently based in Chestnut Hill, MA.[6] She and her husband have five grandchildren.[10]

Fudge, Ann
Contemporary Black Biography 
COPYRIGHT 2005 Thomson Gale




Ann Fudge1951– Corporate executive Ann Fudge's estimable rise through the ranks of corporate power made her one of the most influential—and at the same time one of the youngest—decisionmaking women in American business. Her achievement is all the more impressive, wrote New York Times reporter Judith H. Dobrzynski, because she "had to crash through not merely the glass ceiling that stymies white women but an all-but-insurmountable 'concrete wall' that researchers say blocks blacks and other minorities from companies' upper echelons." For years her success went relatively unnoticed amongst media tallies of other female movers and shakers in high positions—but that's probably not something to which the dynamic and well-regarded executive gives much thought. Rising to the presidency of the $5 billion Beverages, Desserts and Post Division of Kraft General Foods, before she turned 50, Fudge never lost sight of her family duties nor her civic responsibilities. She even retired from corporate life in the early 2000s to devote more time to her personal life before being recruited to become the president of the advertising giant, Young and Rubicam Brands, in 2003. Her unique blend of business acumen and respect for her personal life made her a much sought after mentor to businesses and people alike.Fudge was born on April 23, 1951, in Washington, DC, and attended the city's Catholic schools. Witnessing the urban riots in the wake of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination in 1968 helped her gain a focus. "They made me incredibly determined," she told Dobrzynski in the New York Times. "I wanted to do something that black people hadn't done before. When I hit roadblocks, that was what kept me going." After high school, Fudge enrolled at Simmons College to pursue a bachelor's degree. Fudge admitted to Business Week that she "didn't have a dream job growing up." However, in college she met Margaret Henning, author of the influential book The Managerial Woman, and later a founder of the college's school of business. As her adviser, Henning told the undergraduate Fudge that she recognized in her some of the skills crucial to becoming a corporate executive, and that she should pursue it as a career.While at Simmons, Fudge also met her future husband, Richard, and the two married and had their first child while she was still an undergraduate. After earning her bachelor's degree in retail mangament in 1973, Fudge began work as a personnel executive for General Electric and took on the demanding lifestyle required of working mothers—her family now included a second son. A business degree was next. After graduating from Harvard Business School with an MBA in 1977, Fudge was hired by the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based General Mills company. She then set for herself a timetable of professional goals, including becoming the general manager of a brand by the age of 40.In her first position at General Mills, Fudge was a marketing assistant for brands made by this sixth-largest food manufacturing company in the United States. By 1978, Fudge had begun moving quickly up the corporate ranks, becoming assistant product manager that year and product manager in 1980, and finally a director of marketing by 1983, responsible for four brands at once. During her tenure, she headed a team that developed and introduced to the consumer market a new breakfast cereal—Honey Nut Cheerios, which quickly became one of the division's top performers. On the verge of a promotion to general manager in 1986, Fudge instead accepted another job offer in order to be closer to her ailing mother on the other side of the country.That job offer was at Kraft General Foods in White Plains, NY, a subsidiary of Philip Morris, Inc. and the nation's largest consumables manufacturer. For its products, the parent company had, at the time, an advertising budget of over $2 billion, one of the deepest pocketbooks in American business. Fudge became responsible for some of that ad budget when she was promoted to brand manager of the Dinners and Enhancers Division in 1991. In her new position, Fudge oversaw longtime company staples such as Log Cabin Syrup, Minute Rice, and Stove Top Stuffing. Such brands had a high consumer recognition factor, but were meeting fierce competition from cheaper private-label goods.At Kraft General Foods, Fudge quickly became known for having a special skill for reviving older brands and repositioning them in the market. One example of Fudge's success in the Dinners and Enhancers division was Shake 'N Bake, a mixture of seasoning and bread crumbs that came in specially-designed pouches. Consumers added meat such as chicken drumsticks to the bag, tossed it around, and then removed the meat and baked it. The brand had not warranted a high-profile television advertising campaign in several years, and Fudge and her team came up with the slogan "Why Fry?" to reintroduce the product. They also revamped the print ad campaign. Within months, Shake 'N Bake sales saw double-digit growth.A similar strategy was used with Stove Top Stuffing, which also yielded an immediate jump in sales. When Black Enterprise magazine named her one of the country's "21 Women of Power and Influence" in 1991, Fudge was modest about her achievements at Kraft General Foods. "I encourage my team to challenge the status quo," she told the magazine that year. "I'm convinced that everything we do can be done better."

Fostering that cooperative spirit worked well for Fudge. "As a business leader, Ann combines a very forceful personality with a great sensitivity to people," her then-boss, General Foods president Robert S. Morrison, told Black Enterprise writer Ronda Reynolds. "She relies heavily on a team approach to achieving business goals." He went on to say that Fudge had positively impacted every area she worked at within the company. In 1991, she was promoted to general manager of the brand division, a year ahead of her goal.At a Glance …Born Ann Marie Fudge April 23, 1951, in Washington, DC; daughter of a U.S. Postal Service administrator and a National Security Agency manager; married Richard Fudge, Sr. (an educational and training consultant to businesses and nonprofit groups), 1970 (?); children: Richard Jr., Kevin. Education: Simmons College, BA (honors), retail management, 1973; Harvard Business School, MBA, 1977.Career:   General Electric Company, manpower specialist, 1973–75; General Mills Corporation, Minneapolis, MN, marketing assistant, 1977–78, assistant product manager, 1978–80, product manager, 1980–83, marketing director, 1983–86; Kraft General Foods, White Plains, NY, associate director of strategic planning, 1986–89, vice president for marketing and development in the Dinners and Enhancers division, 1989–91, general manager of same division, 1991–93, executive vice president, 1993–2000, president of Maxwell House Coffee division, 1994–2003; president of Beverages, Desserts and Post Division, 2000–2003; Young and Rubicam Brands, chairman and CEO, 2003–; chairman and CEO, Young and Rubicam Advertising 2003–2005.Memberships:   National Black MBA Association; Junior League; Executive Leadership Council (has served as vice president and president); member of the board of governors of Boys and Girls Club of America; member of board of directors of Allied Signal, Inc., and Liz Claiborne, Inc., and of Simmons College, Harvard Business School Alumni Association, and the Catalyst Advisory Board.Awards:   COGME Fellow, 1975–76; Young Women's Christian Association Leadership Award, 1979; Harvard Alumni Achievement Award, 1998; Executive Leadership Council Achievement Award, 2000; University of Arizona Executive of the Year, 2005.Addresses: Office—Young and Rubicam Brands, 285 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10017.The promotion was also teamed with Fudge's ascension to executive vice president at Kraft General Foods. Her rise up the corporate ladder was not without sacrifice, however. She once turned down a top job offer that entailed a move to another city. "It would have meant relocating just as my son was entering his senior year in high school," she told National Executive writers Deborah J. Swiss and Judith P. Walker. "I didn't think it would be right to move him that year. And I did not want to be a commuter wife and mom."In 1993 Fudge's success in the Dinners and Enhancers division—which included double-digit growth and an increased market share for many of the products whose images she retooled—was responsible for her promotion to executive vice president within the company. The following year, her skills brought her an even tougher assignment—taking over the presidency of Kraft's ailing Maxwell House Coffee brand. The canned coffee product held the number two market spot, after Procter & Gamble's Folgers, but such supermarket coffee products were becoming increasingly overshadowed by a consumer preference for more sophisticated beans and specialty brands.Fudge started off her new job by visiting the nation's home of the nineties' coffee craze, Seattle. Younger consumers are more apt to buy pricey beans from specialty gourmet coffee retailers such as Starbucks than to purchase a can of Maxwell House. Fudge's plan was to revamp advertising and reposition the brand to make it more attractive to this segment of the market. She faced a tough job—Maxwell House had tried this approach before, and failed, in part because their "marketing strategies did not have enough finesse," Ted R. Lingle, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America told Reynolds in Black Enterprise. "And [General Foods] does so much by committee." Fudge's plan was to emphasize the durability and retro-chic of the brand by bringing back some elements of its old advertising campaigns, a position opposed by Kraft executives above her. Lingle, however, noted that Fudge's qualifications and previous successes gave her the edge to make her strategy a success.

Fudge's achievements caused some to predict that she would be the first African American woman to run a major company in the United States. Many large companies attempted to add diversity to all facets of their workforce, including the highest corporate offices. Fudge's astounding success and business demeanor attracted attention from corporate headhunters. But it was another offer from Kraft that she accepted in 2000, when she became president of the Beverages, Desserts and Post Division.The division flourished under her leadership, but after one year Fudge decided to retire. She related to Business Week that her choice to leave Kraft was based on a number of reasons. She had had a goal of retiring before age 50; she had dealt with the recent illness and death of her parents, some close friends and relatives. "To be honest, I still haven't figured it out," she told Business Week. "It was definitely not dissatisfaction. It was stepping back and saying, 'What are you really here for? What do you really want to accomplish?'" She spent two years reconnecting with friends and family and delving into community work. Her charitable work included work with a number of organizations, including the Executive Leadership Council, a non-profit group of high-level African American leaders in business, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Partnership For a Drug-Free America, and the United Way, among others. From her time away, Fudge became inspired by the power individuals have to make a difference in the world.In 2003, Fudge returned to the world of work, becoming the chairman and CEO of Young and Rubicam Brands, a major communications company. The company included a medley of advertising, communications, and marketing companies owned by the WPP Group. With the top position, Fudge also became the first head of a major American advertising firm, Young and Rubicam Advertising. Fudge was "brought in as a change agent-one that would change the culture and future direction of Y&R Brands," Ken Smikle, president of Target Market News, a Chicago-based research company told Black Enterprise. Fudge related to Business Week that her hiatus from work gave her needed perspective and that this position she took on as a way of serving others, not to boost her own ego. By 2005, Fudge had brought about positive change for the company, stepping down from leadership of the advertising arm in April, but remaining at the helm of the larger Young and Rubicam Brands.Throughout her career, Fudge has used her skills and experience to increase African American presence in the upper ranks of corporate America. "Ann wears nice kid gloves that mask an iron fist," a colleague of hers on the boards of some professional and charitable organizations told Reynolds in Black Enterprise. "She's eminently qualified and a terrific leader." With her unique perspective on her work as service to others, Fudge seemed on track to be remembered as she hoped, as a person who "made a difference in how people view themselves individually and how they view themselves collectively," as she told Business Week.SourcesPeriodicalsBlack Enterprise, August 1991, p. 52; February 1993, p. 94; June 1994, p. 63; August 1994, p. 68; July 2003; April 2005.Business Week, April 25, 2005, p. 44.Ebony, July 2003.Essence, May 1995, p. 114.Fortune, November 14, 2005, p. 169.National Executive, November 1993, p. 44.New York Times, May 11, 1995.On-line"Ann Fudge on Making Choices," Business Week, http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_13/b3876011_mz001.htm (January 2, 2006).

Ann Fudge 1951(?)—
Corporate executive 
Balanced Personal and Career Goals
Marketed Classic Brands
Moved Into Senior Offices
Sources
Ann Fudge’s estimable rise through the ranks of corporate power have made her one of the most influential--while also one of the youngest-decision-making women in American business. Yet her success has gone relatively unnoticed amongst media tallies of other female movers and shakers in high positions-but that’s probably not something to which the dynamic and well-regarded executive gives much thought. Named president of Maxwell House Coffee in 1994, a division of tobacco conglomerate Philip Morris’s Kraft Foods division, Fudge is responsible for overseeing quality and marketing for the venerable coffee brand and its sister product General Foods International Coffees. Her achievement is all the more impressive, wroteNeu; York Times reporter Judith H. Dobrzynski, because “the 44-year-old had to crash through not merely the glass ceiling that stymies white women but an all-but-insurmountable “concrete wall’ that researchers say blocks blacks and other minorities from companies’ upper echelons.”
Fudge was born in Washington, DC, in the early 1950s, and attended the city’s Catholic schools. Witnessing the urban riots in the wake of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination in 1968 helped her gain a focus. “They made me incredibly determined,” she told Dobrzynski in the New York Times. “I wanted to do something that black people hadn’t done before. When I hit roadblocks, that was what kept me going.” After high school, Fudge enrolled at Simmons College to pursue a B. A. There she met Margaret Henning, author of the influential book The Managerial Woman, and later a founder of the college’s school of business. As her adviser, Henning told the undergraduate Fudge that she recognized in her some of the skills crucial to becoming a corporate executive, and that she should pursue it as a career.
Balanced Personal and Career Goals
While at Simmons, Fudge also met her future husband, Richard, and the two married and had their first child while she was still an undergraduate. After earning her B.A. in 1973, Fudge worked as a personnel executive for General Electric, and she began to take on the demanding lifestyle required of working mothers-her family now included a second son. A business degree was next. After graduating from Harvard Business School with an M.B.A. in 1977, Fudge was hired by the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based General Mills company. She then set for herself a timetable of professional goals, including becoming the general manager of a brand by the age of 40.
In her first position at General Mills, Fudge was a marketing assistant for brands made by this sixth-largest food manufacturing company in the United States. By 1978, Fudge had begun moving quickly up the corporate ranks, becoming assistant product manager that year and product manager in 1980, and finally a

Addresses:   Home–Westport, CT. Office –Maxwell House Coffee Company, 250 North St, White Plains, NY 10605,
director of marketing by 1983, responsible for four brands at once. During her tenure, she headed a team that developed and introduced to the consumer market a new breakfast cereal—Honey Nut Cheerios, which quickly became one of the division’s top performers. On the verge of a promotion to general manager in 1986, Fudge instead accepted another job offer in order to be closer to her ailing mother on the other side of the country.
That job offer was at Kraft General Foods in White Plains, NY, a subsidiary of Philip Morris, Inc. and the nation’s largest consumables manufacturer. For its products, the parent company has an advertising budget of over $2 billion, one of the deepest pocketbooks in American business. Fudge became responsible for some of that ad budget when she was promoted to brand manager of the Dinners and Enhancers Division in 1991. In her new position, Fudge oversaw longtime company staples such as Log Cabin Syrup, Minute Rice, and Stove Top Stuffing. Such brands had a high consumer recognition factor, but were meeting fierce competition from cheaper private-label goods.
Marketed Classic Brands
At Kraft General Foods, Fudge quickly became known for having a special skill for reviving older brands and repositioning them on the market. One example of Fudge’s success in the Dinners and Enhancers division was Shake ‘N Bake, a mixture of seasoning and bread crumbs that came in specially-designed pouches. Consumers added meat such as chicken drumsticks to the bag, tossed it around, and then removed the meat and baked it. The brand had not warranted a high-profile television advertising campaign in several years, and Fudge and her team came up with the slogan “Why Fry?” to reintroduce the product. They also revamped the print ad campaign. Within months, Shake ‘N Bake sales saw double-digit growth.
A similar strategy was used with Stove Top Stuffing, which also yielded an immediate jump in sales. When Black Enterprise magazine named her one of the country’s “21 Women of Power and Influence” in 1991, Fudge was modest about her achievements at Kraft General Foods. “I encourage my team to challenge the status quo,” she told the magazine that year. “I’m convinced that everything we do can be done better.”


Fostering that cooperative spirit seems to work best for Fudge. “As a business leader, Ann combines a very forceful personality with a great sensitivity to people,” her boss, General Foods president Robert S. Morrison, told Black Enterprise writer Ronda Reynolds. “She relies heavily on a team approach to achieving business goals.” He went on to say that Fudge had positively impacted every area she worked at within the company. In 1991, she was promoted to general manager of the brand division, a year ahead of her goal.
The promotion was also teamed with Fudge’s ascension to executive vice president at Kraft General Foods. Her rise up the corporate ladder was not without sacrifice, however. She once turned down a top job offer that entailed a move to another city. “It would have meant relocating just as my son was entering his senior year in high school,” she told National Executive writers Deborah J. Swiss and Judith P. Walker. “I didn’t think it would be right to move him that year. And I did not want to be a commuter wife and mom.”
Moved Into Senior Offices
In 1993 Fudge’s success in the Dinners and Enhancers division--which included double-digit growth and an increased market share for many of the products whose images she retooled-was responsible for her promotion to executive vice president within the company. The following year, her skills brought her an even tougher assignment-taking over the presidency of Kraft’s ailing Maxwell House Coffee brand. The canned coffee product held the number two market spot, after Procter & Gamble’s Folgers, but such supermarket coffee products were becoming increasingly overshadowed by a consumer preference for more sophisticated beans and specialty brands.
Fudge started off her new job by visiting the nation’s home of the nineties’ coffee craze, Seattle. Younger consumers are more apt to buy pricey beans from specialty gourmet coffee retailers such as Starbucks than to purchase a can of Maxwell House. Fudge’s plan was to revamp advertising and reposition the brand to make it more attractive to this segment of the market. She faced a tough job--Maxwell House had tried this approach before, and failed, in part because their “marketing strategies did not have enough finesse,” Ted R. Lingle, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America told Reynolds in Black Enterprise. “And [General Foods] does so much by committee.” Fudge’s plan was to emphasize the durability and retro–chic of the brand by bringing back some elements of its old advertising campaigns, a position opposed by Kraft executives above her. Lingle, however, noted that Fudge’s qualifications and previous successes gave her the edge to make her strategy a success.
Fudge’s achievements have caused some to predict that she will be the first African American woman to run a major company in the United States. Large companies are attempting to add diversity to all facets of their workforce, including the highest corporate offices. Fudge’s astounding success and business demeanor have attracted attention from corporate headhunters, and it seems assured that the next 20 years of her career will bring an even higher degree of achievement-and accolades. In 1993 Fudge was invited to sit on the boards of Allied Signal and Liz Claiborne, Inc.
Fudge also manages to balance the personal and professional with the charitable. She is a member of a number of organizations, including the Executive Leadership Council, a non-profit group of high-level African American leaders in business. In all of the positions, Fudge uses her skills and experience to increase African American presence in the upper ranks of corporate America. “Ann wears nice kid gloves that mask an iron fist,” a colleague of hers on the boards of some professional and charitable organizations told Reynolds in Black Enterprise. “She’s eminently qualified and a terrific leader.”

Early life and education[edit]
Fudge was born and raised in Washington, DC and attended the city's Catholic schools[1] through 12th grade. "She cited the riots she lived through after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a 'hurtful' but formative experience. 'They made me incredibly determined,' she said. 'I wanted to do something that black people hadn't done before. When I hit roadblocks, that was what kept me going.' ... She grew up middle class in Washington, the first of two children born to a mother who was a manager at the National Security Agency and a father who was an administrator at the Postal Service. They stressed education ... and [Fudge also] credits the nuns for pushing her to do her best."[2]
Fudge is a graduate of Simmons College and Harvard Business School,[3] earning respectively BA (honors) in retail management, 1973; and MBA, 1977.[1] In 1998, HBS Prof. Stephen A. Greyser recalled Fudge as "a solid citizen, a solid student."[2]
Discussing her educational choices with Business Week in 2004, she said "When I was at Simmons College, I had this great professor -- Margaret Hennig. She was the one who encouraged me to think about business and apply to Harvard Business School. She and Ann Jardim wrote the first book on women in business, called The Managerial Woman, and founded the Simmons Graduate School of Business. I applied to Harvard Business School my senior year."[4]
Career[edit]
One job Fudge had while still in high school was with the Teen Board[5] at Hecht's department store. The job included advising on teen-age fashions and a trip to fashion magazines in New York. After college, Fudge worked in the human resources department of the General Electric Company before pursuing her MBA.[2]
After Harvard, Fudge spent nine years at General Mills.[6] "Her biggest accomplishment there, she said, was her part as a marketing assistant on the team that developed Honey Nut Cheerios. Today, it's one of the nation's biggest cereal brands."[2] Fudge then served, ultimately, as president of the beverages, desserts and Post division, a $5 billion unit of Kraft Foods. At Kraft, she served on the management committee and managed many businesses including Maxwell House coffee, Gevalia kaffe, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, Post Cereals, Jell-O desserts, and Altoids.[6]
In 1998, Fudge was named by Fortune magazine as 30th on the 50 Most Influential Women in American Business list (Carly Fiorina #1 Oprah Winfrey #2), while she was executive vice president at Kraft. At the time, coffee and cereals for which Fudge was responsible accounted for $2.7 billion (16%) of Kraft's $16.8 billion in sales. She also at the time sat on the boards of AlliedSignal, Liz Claiborne, (both as of 1993[2]) and Catalyst, Inc.[7][8]
In 2001, after a year as president of the beverages et al. division at Kraft, "Fudge decided to retire. She related to Business Week that her choice to leave Kraft was based on a number of reasons. She had had a goal of retiring before age 50; she had dealt with the recent illness and death of her parents, some close friends and relatives. 'To be honest, I still haven't figured it out. ... It was definitely not dissatisfaction. It was stepping back and saying, "What are you really here for? What do you really want to accomplish?"' She spent two years reconnecting with friends and family and delving into community work. Her charitable work included work with a number of organizations, including the Executive Leadership Council, a non-profit group of high-level African-American leaders in business, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and the United Way, among others. From her time away, Fudge became inspired by the power individuals have to make a difference in the world."[1]
Following the sabbatical, Fudge served as chair and chief executive officer of Young & Rubicam Brands from 2003 to 2007. In 2004, Business Week summed up some of the challenges facing her, saying Y&R "has suffered through poor management and a messy merger in recent years. The various units tend to work in isolation. The ad agency has lost some big clients. And employees are disgruntled ... [including] reports of animosity between Fudge and creative head Michael Patti."[3][4]
Fudge was Inside the Boardroom guest, 2008, Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.
In February 2011, Fudge was featured by the Commonwealth Institute in Miami, Florida,[9] and in April 2011, Fudge spoke at the Economic Club of Minnesota.[10]
As of 2011, Fudge served on the boards of directors of General Electric, Novartis, and Unilever.[10] She also served as chair of the U.S. Programs Advisory Board of The Gates Foundation; and she was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation, Brookings Institution,[11] the Council on Foreign Relations and Morehouse College.[6] She has been a Morehouse trustee since April 2006.[3] She has also served on the board of Buzzient, Inc, and served as vice chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers.[12]
In June 2011, it was announced that Fudge would join the board of Indian technology and outsourcing company Infosys on October 1, 2011, as an Additional Director.[12] Fudge was at the time the sole woman on the board, and was recruited by retiring founder NR Narayana Murthy and nominations committee chair Jeffrey S. Lehman. Murthy had served also on the Unilever board and knew Fudge from there.[13]
In September 2011, Fudge was one of six Hall of Fame honorees named in advance of the National Association of Corporate Directors November gala in New York City.[14][15]
Political involvement and public service[edit]
In 2008, Fudge was a member of the Obama presidential campaign’s finance committee.[16]
In early 2010, Fudge was named by President Obama to the 18-member National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, a bipartisan panel chaired by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, (R-WY), and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles (D). The balance of the panel was three more members appointed by the President, six members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and six members of the U.S. Senate. The commission first met on April 27, 2010[17] and had a December report deadline. Though specific actions based on the report were limited, commission members who were also members of Congress reappeared in the so-called Gang of Six in spring and summer, 2011, in the debt-ceiling-increase debate.[18][19]
In September 2010, Fudge was listed as one of several possible candidates to replace Larry Summers as director of the National Economic Council.[20] Some reports signalled that the White House could be looking for a female executive with business experience to fill the post.[21][22]
In September 2011, Fudge joined in the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) "Go Big" forum. CRFB, along with the New America Foundation, the Concord Coalition, and the Bipartisan Policy Center "discuss[ed] the path ahead for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (Super Committee) and the reasons it should exceed its mandate".[23]
Fudge also serves on the State Department's Foreign Affairs Policy Board.[24]
Personal life[edit]
As a sophomore at Simmons, Ann married Rich Fudge. Before she graduated, they had a baby, Rich Jr. She had to balance personal and academic/professional demands from that early stage on. "Her fondest memory from General Mills ... involved her younger son, Kevin, then 9. Ms. Fudge had just been made a marketing director, the first woman and the first black at that level. 'I came home all excited, and was telling my family, and he said: "What's the big deal, mom? So now instead of one brand, you have four. You can do that." He was right. My sons have helped keep things in perspective.'"[2]
Fudge is also noted for having pursued her career despite the glass ceiling which has been seen to thwart promotion to the top ranks, facing women and minorities in the corporate workforce particularly.[2] And, in regards Fudge's relatively early moves out of jobs, the 2004 Business Week article also included a sidebar on four "other women [who] left high-powered positions in the corporate world to find a place where they could work on their own terms."[25]
Fudge is currently based in Chestnut Hill, MA.[6] She and her husband have five grandchildren.[10]

Early life and education[edit]
Fudge was born and raised in Washington, DC and attended the city's Catholic schools[1] through 12th grade. "She cited the riots she lived through after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a 'hurtful' but formative experience. 'They made me incredibly determined,' she said. 'I wanted to do something that black people hadn't done before. When I hit roadblocks, that was what kept me going.' ... She grew up middle class in Washington, the first of two children born to a mother who was a manager at the National Security Agency and a father who was an administrator at the Postal Service. They stressed education ... and [Fudge also] credits the nuns for pushing her to do her best."[2]
Fudge is a graduate of Simmons College and Harvard Business School,[3] earning respectively BA (honors) in retail management, 1973; and MBA, 1977.[1] In 1998, HBS Prof. Stephen A. Greyser recalled Fudge as "a solid citizen, a solid student."[2]
Discussing her educational choices with Business Week in 2004, she said "When I was at Simmons College, I had this great professor -- Margaret Hennig. She was the one who encouraged me to think about business and apply to Harvard Business School. She and Ann Jardim wrote the first book on women in business, called The Managerial Woman, and founded the Simmons Graduate School of Business. I applied to Harvard Business School my senior year."[4]
Career[edit]
One job Fudge had while still in high school was with the Teen Board[5] at Hecht's department store. The job included advising on teen-age fashions and a trip to fashion magazines in New York. After college, Fudge worked in the human resources department of the General Electric Company before pursuing her MBA.[2]
After Harvard, Fudge spent nine years at General Mills.[6] "Her biggest accomplishment there, she said, was her part as a marketing assistant on the team that developed Honey Nut Cheerios. Today, it's one of the nation's biggest cereal brands."[2] Fudge then served, ultimately, as president of the beverages, desserts and Post division, a $5 billion unit of Kraft Foods. At Kraft, she served on the management committee and managed many businesses including Maxwell House coffee, Gevalia kaffe, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, Post Cereals, Jell-O desserts, and Altoids.[6]
In 1998, Fudge was named by Fortune magazine as 30th on the 50 Most Influential Women in American Business list (Carly Fiorina #1 Oprah Winfrey #2), while she was executive vice president at Kraft. At the time, coffee and cereals for which Fudge was responsible accounted for $2.7 billion (16%) of Kraft's $16.8 billion in sales. She also at the time sat on the boards of AlliedSignal, Liz Claiborne, (both as of 1993[2]) and Catalyst, Inc.[7][8]
In 2001, after a year as president of the beverages et al. division at Kraft, "Fudge decided to retire. She related to Business Week that her choice to leave Kraft was based on a number of reasons. She had had a goal of retiring before age 50; she had dealt with the recent illness and death of her parents, some close friends and relatives. 'To be honest, I still haven't figured it out. ... It was definitely not dissatisfaction. It was stepping back and saying, "What are you really here for? What do you really want to accomplish?"' She spent two years reconnecting with friends and family and delving into community work. Her charitable work included work with a number of organizations, including the Executive Leadership Council, a non-profit group of high-level African-American leaders in business, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and the United Way, among others. From her time away, Fudge became inspired by the power individuals have to make a difference in the world."[1]
Following the sabbatical, Fudge served as chair and chief executive officer of Young & Rubicam Brands from 2003 to 2007. In 2004, Business Week summed up some of the challenges facing her, saying Y&R "has suffered through poor management and a messy merger in recent years. The various units tend to work in isolation. The ad agency has lost some big clients. And employees are disgruntled ... [including] reports of animosity between Fudge and creative head Michael Patti."[3][4]
Fudge was Inside the Boardroom guest, 2008, Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.
In February 2011, Fudge was featured by the Commonwealth Institute in Miami, Florida,[9] and in April 2011, Fudge spoke at the Economic Club of Minnesota.[10]
As of 2011, Fudge served on the boards of directors of General Electric, Novartis, and Unilever.[10] She also served as chair of the U.S. Programs Advisory Board of The Gates Foundation; and she was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation, Brookings Institution,[11] the Council on Foreign Relations and Morehouse College.[6] She has been a Morehouse trustee since April 2006.[3] She has also served on the board of Buzzient, Inc, and served as vice chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers.[12]
In June 2011, it was announced that Fudge would join the board of Indian technology and outsourcing company Infosys on October 1, 2011, as an Additional Director.[12] Fudge was at the time the sole woman on the board, and was recruited by retiring founder NR Narayana Murthy and nominations committee chair Jeffrey S. Lehman. Murthy had served also on the Unilever board and knew Fudge from there.[13]
In September 2011, Fudge was one of six Hall of Fame honorees named in advance of the National Association of Corporate Directors November gala in New York City.[14][15]
Political involvement and public service[edit]
In 2008, Fudge was a member of the Obama presidential campaign’s finance committee.[16]
In early 2010, Fudge was named by President Obama to the 18-member National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, a bipartisan panel chaired by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, (R-WY), and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles (D). The balance of the panel was three more members appointed by the President, six members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and six members of the U.S. Senate. The commission first met on April 27, 2010[17] and had a December report deadline. Though specific actions based on the report were limited, commission members who were also members of Congress reappeared in the so-called Gang of Six in spring and summer, 2011, in the debt-ceiling-increase debate.[18][19]
In September 2010, Fudge was listed as one of several possible candidates to replace Larry Summers as director of the National Economic Council.[20] Some reports signalled that the White House could be looking for a female executive with business experience to fill the post.[21][22]
In September 2011, Fudge joined in the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) "Go Big" forum. CRFB, along with the New America Foundation, the Concord Coalition, and the Bipartisan Policy Center "discuss[ed] the path ahead for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (Super Committee) and the reasons it should exceed its mandate".[23]
Fudge also serves on the State Department's Foreign Affairs Policy Board.[24]
Personal life[edit]
As a sophomore at Simmons, Ann married Rich Fudge. Before she graduated, they had a baby, Rich Jr. She had to balance personal and academic/professional demands from that early stage on. "Her fondest memory from General Mills ... involved her younger son, Kevin, then 9. Ms. Fudge had just been made a marketing director, the first woman and the first black at that level. 'I came home all excited, and was telling my family, and he said: "What's the big deal, mom? So now instead of one brand, you have four. You can do that." He was right. My sons have helped keep things in perspective.'"[2]
Fudge is also noted for having pursued her career despite the glass ceiling which has been seen to thwart promotion to the top ranks, facing women and minorities in the corporate workforce particularly.[2] And, in regards Fudge's relatively early moves out of jobs, the 2004 Business Week article also included a sidebar on four "other women [who] left high-powered positions in the corporate world to find a place where they could work on their own terms."[25]
Fudge is currently based in Chestnut Hill, MA.[6] She and her husband have five grandchildren.[10]

Early life and education[edit]
Fudge was born and raised in Washington, DC and attended the city's Catholic schools[1] through 12th grade. "She cited the riots she lived through after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a 'hurtful' but formative experience. 'They made me incredibly determined,' she said. 'I wanted to do something that black people hadn't done before. When I hit roadblocks, that was what kept me going.' ... She grew up middle class in Washington, the first of two children born to a mother who was a manager at the National Security Agency and a father who was an administrator at the Postal Service. They stressed education ... and [Fudge also] credits the nuns for pushing her to do her best."[2]
Fudge is a graduate of Simmons College and Harvard Business School,[3] earning respectively BA (honors) in retail management, 1973; and MBA, 1977.[1] In 1998, HBS Prof. Stephen A. Greyser recalled Fudge as "a solid citizen, a solid student."[2]
Discussing her educational choices with Business Week in 2004, she said "When I was at Simmons College, I had this great professor -- Margaret Hennig. She was the one who encouraged me to think about business and apply to Harvard Business School. She and Ann Jardim wrote the first book on women in business, called The Managerial Woman, and founded the Simmons Graduate School of Business. I applied to Harvard Business School my senior year."[4]
Career[edit]
One job Fudge had while still in high school was with the Teen Board[5] at Hecht's department store. The job included advising on teen-age fashions and a trip to fashion magazines in New York. After college, Fudge worked in the human resources department of the General Electric Company before pursuing her MBA.[2]
After Harvard, Fudge spent nine years at General Mills.[6] "Her biggest accomplishment there, she said, was her part as a marketing assistant on the team that developed Honey Nut Cheerios. Today, it's one of the nation's biggest cereal brands."[2] Fudge then served, ultimately, as president of the beverages, desserts and Post division, a $5 billion unit of Kraft Foods. At Kraft, she served on the management committee and managed many businesses including Maxwell House coffee, Gevalia kaffe, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, Post Cereals, Jell-O desserts, and Altoids.[6]
In 1998, Fudge was named by Fortune magazine as 30th on the 50 Most Influential Women in American Business list (Carly Fiorina #1 Oprah Winfrey #2), while she was executive vice president at Kraft. At the time, coffee and cereals for which Fudge was responsible accounted for $2.7 billion (16%) of Kraft's $16.8 billion in sales. She also at the time sat on the boards of AlliedSignal, Liz Claiborne, (both as of 1993[2]) and Catalyst, Inc.[7][8]
In 2001, after a year as president of the beverages et al. division at Kraft, "Fudge decided to retire. She related to Business Week that her choice to leave Kraft was based on a number of reasons. She had had a goal of retiring before age 50; she had dealt with the recent illness and death of her parents, some close friends and relatives. 'To be honest, I still haven't figured it out. ... It was definitely not dissatisfaction. It was stepping back and saying, "What are you really here for? What do you really want to accomplish?"' She spent two years reconnecting with friends and family and delving into community work. Her charitable work included work with a number of organizations, including the Executive Leadership Council, a non-profit group of high-level African-American leaders in business, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and the United Way, among others. From her time away, Fudge became inspired by the power individuals have to make a difference in the world."[1]
Following the sabbatical, Fudge served as chair and chief executive officer of Young & Rubicam Brands from 2003 to 2007. In 2004, Business Week summed up some of the challenges facing her, saying Y&R "has suffered through poor management and a messy merger in recent years. The various units tend to work in isolation. The ad agency has lost some big clients. And employees are disgruntled ... [including] reports of animosity between Fudge and creative head Michael Patti."[3][4]
Fudge was Inside the Boardroom guest, 2008, Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.
In February 2011, Fudge was featured by the Commonwealth Institute in Miami, Florida,[9] and in April 2011, Fudge spoke at the Economic Club of Minnesota.[10]
As of 2011, Fudge served on the boards of directors of General Electric, Novartis, and Unilever.[10] She also served as chair of the U.S. Programs Advisory Board of The Gates Foundation; and she was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation, Brookings Institution,[11] the Council on Foreign Relations and Morehouse College.[6] She has been a Morehouse trustee since April 2006.[3] She has also served on the board of Buzzient, Inc, and served as vice chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers.[12]
In June 2011, it was announced that Fudge would join the board of Indian technology and outsourcing company Infosys on October 1, 2011, as an Additional Director.[12] Fudge was at the time the sole woman on the board, and was recruited by retiring founder NR Narayana Murthy and nominations committee chair Jeffrey S. Lehman. Murthy had served also on the Unilever board and knew Fudge from there.[13]
In September 2011, Fudge was one of six Hall of Fame honorees named in advance of the National Association of Corporate Directors November gala in New York City.[14][15]
Political involvement and public service[edit]
In 2008, Fudge was a member of the Obama presidential campaign’s finance committee.[16]
In early 2010, Fudge was named by President Obama to the 18-member National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, a bipartisan panel chaired by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, (R-WY), and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles (D). The balance of the panel was three more members appointed by the President, six members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and six members of the U.S. Senate. The commission first met on April 27, 2010[17] and had a December report deadline. Though specific actions based on the report were limited, commission members who were also members of Congress reappeared in the so-called Gang of Six in spring and summer, 2011, in the debt-ceiling-increase debate.[18][19]
In September 2010, Fudge was listed as one of several possible candidates to replace Larry Summers as director of the National Economic Council.[20] Some reports signalled that the White House could be looking for a female executive with business experience to fill the post.[21][22]
In September 2011, Fudge joined in the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) "Go Big" forum. CRFB, along with the New America Foundation, the Concord Coalition, and the Bipartisan Policy Center "discuss[ed] the path ahead for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (Super Committee) and the reasons it should exceed its mandate".[23]
Fudge also serves on the State Department's Foreign Affairs Policy Board.[24]
Personal life[edit]
As a sophomore at Simmons, Ann married Rich Fudge. Before she graduated, they had a baby, Rich Jr. She had to balance personal and academic/professional demands from that early stage on. "Her fondest memory from General Mills ... involved her younger son, Kevin, then 9. Ms. Fudge had just been made a marketing director, the first woman and the first black at that level. 'I came home all excited, and was telling my family, and he said: "What's the big deal, mom? So now instead of one brand, you have four. You can do that." He was right. My sons have helped keep things in perspective.'"[2]
Fudge is also noted for having pursued her career despite the glass ceiling which has been seen to thwart promotion to the top ranks, facing women and minorities in the corporate workforce particularly.[2] And, in regards Fudge's relatively early moves out of jobs, the 2004 Business Week article also included a sidebar on four "other women [who] left high-powered positions in the corporate world to find a place where they could work on their own terms."[25]
Fudge is currently based in Chestnut Hill, MA.[6] She and her husband have five grandchildren.[10]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
