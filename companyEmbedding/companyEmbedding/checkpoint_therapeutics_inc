About Us



Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (“Checkpoint”), a Fortress Biotech Company, is an immuno-oncology biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel, non-chemotherapy, immune-enhanced combination treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers. We aim to acquire rights to these technologies by licensing the rights or otherwise acquiring an ownership interest in the technologies, funding their research and development and eventually either out-licensing or bringing the technologies to market. Currently we are developing a portfolio of fully human immuno-oncology targeted antibodies generated in the laboratory of Dr. Wayne Marasco, MD, PhD, a professor in the Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (“Dana-Farber”). The portfolio of antibodies we licensed from Dana-Farber includes antibodies targeting programmed death-ligand 1 (“PD-L1”), glucocorticoid-induced TNFR related protein (“GITR”) and carbonic anhydrase IX (“CAIX”) (together, the “Dana-Farber Antibodies”). We plan to develop these novel immuno-oncology and checkpoint inhibitor antibodies on their own and in combination with each other, as published literature suggests that combinations of these targets may work synergistically together. We expect to submit investigational new drug (“IND”) applications for our anti-PD-L1 antibody in 2017, and our anti-GITR and anti-CAIX antibodies in 2018. We have also licensed and are developing three oral targeted anti-cancer therapies consisting of an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) mutations, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (“BET”) protein, BRD4, and an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (“PARP”). We submitted an IND application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for our EGFR inhibitor, which was accepted in August 2016, and in September 2016 we dosed the first patient in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial.  We plan to submit an IND application for our BET inhibitor in 2017. We are currently developing a clinical program for our PARP inhibitor, which we expect to commence in 2017. Additionally, we will seek to add additional immuno-oncology drugs as well as other targeted therapies to create wholly-owned proprietary combinations that leverage the immune system and other complimentary mechanisms.  Checkpoint is headquartered in New York City.

Pipeline
Anti-PD-L1 Research Program



Our anti-PD-L1 mAb is a fully human antagonistic antibody that binds PD-L1 and blocks its interaction with Programmed cell death protein 1 (“PD-1”). PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 are checkpoints of immune activation and play a very important role in negative regulation of T-cell effector function and proliferation. Physiological interaction between these molecules inhibits immune activation to prevent autoimmunity and to induce self-tolerance. Many different cancers take advantage of this pathway by expressing PD-L1 and triggering negative signaling in PD-1expressing tumor reactive T-cells thus blocking anti-tumor T-cell immune response.
Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that antibodies blocking interaction of PD-1 with its ligands or those blocking interaction of PD-L1 alone with PD-1 can augment anti-tumor T-cell responses and lead to complete and lasting tumor eradication in a certain proportion of patients. Confirmed overall response rate (“ORR”) in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) labels for the approved PD-1 blocking antibodies was cited in the 20-30% range based on clinical trials in patients with metastatic melanoma. Potent therapeutic anti-tumor responses due to blocking of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction has been demonstrated in patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (“NSCLC”).
We plan to develop an anti-PD-L1 antibody for oncology indications, including, but not limited to, the treatment of patients with NSCLC and RCC. In March of 2015, we entered into a partnership agreement to co-develop an anti-PD-L1 antibody for hematological oncological indications with TG Therapeutics, Inc. (“TGTX”). We believe that an anti-PD-L1 antibody has the potential to be effective in many oncological indications as a mono therapy or in combination with other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds and other targeted therapies.
We licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to anti-PD-L1 antibodies from Dana-Farber in March 2015. We plan to submit an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) to the FDA during the first half of 2017.

Pipeline
CK-101 EGFR Inhibitor Program



CK-101 is an oral, third generation covalent inhibitor against selective mutations of EGFR. Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR are found in approximately 20% of patients with advanced NSCLC. Compared to chemotherapy, first generation EGFR inhibitors significantly improved ORR and progression free survival in previously untreated NSCLC patients carrying EGFR mutations. However, tumor progression could develop due to resistance mutations, often within months of treatment with first generation EGFR inhibitors.
The EGFR T790M “gatekeeper” mutation is the most common resistant mutation found in patients treated with first generation EGFR inhibitors. The mutation decreases the affinity of first generation inhibitors to EGFR kinase domain, rendering the drugs ineffective. Second generation EGFR inhibitors have improved in vitro potency against the T790M mutation, but have not provided meaningful benefits in NSCLC patients due to toxicity from inhibition of the wildtype EGFR activities.
The third generation EGFR inhibitors are designed to be highly selective against the T790M mutation while sparing wildtype EGFR, thereby improving tolerability and safety profiles. In clinical studies, third generation EGFR inhibitors have demonstrated robust response in second-line NSCLC patients carrying the T790M mutations, with an ORR of up to 50 to 60%. In addition, some of the third generation inhibitors are also active against activating EGFR mutations seen in first-line NSCLC patients such as L858R and del 19, and have shown efficacy in monotherapy studies.
We plan to develop CK-101 for oncology indications, including, but not limited to, the treatment of NSCLC patients carrying the susceptible EGFR mutations. These include the EGFR T790M mutation in the second-line NSCLC patients as well as the EGFR L858R and del 19 mutations in first-line NSCLC patients. We believe that CK-101 has the potential to be effective in these oncological indications as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds and other targeted therapies. Existing preclinical data from other programs support the combination of third generation EGFR inhibitor with checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 or PD-L1), cMET inhibitors, or MEK inhibitors.
In March 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with NeuPharma to develop and commercialize novel covalent third generation EGFR inhibitor on a worldwide basis outside of certain Asian countries.  In August 2016, the FDA accepted our IND application, and in September 2016 we dosed the first patient in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.
