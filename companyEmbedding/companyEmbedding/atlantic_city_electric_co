Atlantic City Electric Co.
List of Deals

1971 Atlantic City Electric Company: 750,000 shares of common stock ($3 par value) issued April 22, 1971, and $27,000,000 first mortgage bonds 8% series due 2001 dated May 1, 1971, and  issued May 6, 1971
1972 Atlantic City Electric Company: 700,000 shares of common stock ($3 par value) issued October 18, 1972

Atlantic City Electric Company was organized in New Jersey in 1924 as a result of a merger and consolidation of several utility companies.  The company was primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy in the southern part of New Jersey.
By 1972 the company sold and distributed electric energy to 377 communities in the state of New Jersey.  Some of the communities served were summer resort areas, but the revenue from non-resort areas in 1971 was 72 percent of total revenues.  Atlantic City Electric also furnished process steam and water, and delivered by-product energy generated by back pressure turbines, to E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company.  The process steam was generated by equipment installed at the company's Deepwater Generating Station and Greenwich Station, both operated by Deepwater Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary.  Overland Realty, Inc., also a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, was, at the time, engaged in the acquisition and ownership of land and interests to be used as sites for the location of generating stations or industrial or residential development.  As of 1972, the company owned four steam electric generating stations and turbo-generator units, with a net capability of 922,700 kilowatts.
In the mid-1970s Atlantic City Electric made an innovative move on the front of energy conservation when it began to note customers' percent increase or decrease in energy use on their bills. This action had benefits for all involved: customers, who could save money; the country, which could benefit from conservation; and the company, which could delay costly expansions.

State: New Jersey
Number of Customers: 545,000
Main Service Areas: Southern New Jersey
Contact Information: 1-800-642-3780
Atlantic City Electric, which is a subsidiary of Pepco Holdings, Inc., is one of primary electric utilities servicing the southern portion of New Jersey. With a service area that spans over 2,700 miles and 545,000 customers, Atlantic City Electric is one of the key providers of energy services in the state. The utility?s service area includes the following counties:



Atlantic
Burlington
Camden


Cape May
Cumberland
Gloucester


Ocean
Salem




The utility was first incorporated in 1924 and became part of the Pepco family in 2000. Atlantic City Electric has eight different facilities and 109 substations throughout southern New Jersey. The utility offers several sustainability programs for its community members and proudly offers payment assistance programs to their customers in an effort to help them manage their energy use and keep their account payments up-to-date.
Atlantic City Electric Facilities and Equipment
Atlantic City Electric manages tens of thousands of miles of both underground and above-ground power lines. As the state-appointed utility, Atlantic City Electric is responsible for maintaining these power lines and keeping them safe and operating as they should. This includes providing annual maintenance and tree trimming services around their service area.
Customers who fall under Atlantic City Electric?s service area should be aware that the utility is in charge of the metal towers, poles and transmission lines that carry electricity. Any issues with this equipment should be reported directly to the utility, not the customer?s retail energy provider. The utility is also responsible for issues with outages and storm damage.
Atlantic City Electric Rebates and Incentives
Atlantic City Electric offers rebates, incentives and programs, designed to help their customers save money and use less energy. As part of the utility?s larger effort to improve the environment, Atlantic City Electric also offers incentives for those who use green energy and practice energy efficient measures in their home. This effort is part of the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, designed to help bring more energy from renewable resources to the state.
The utility also has a voluntary program known as the Energy Wise Rewards Program that allows customers to improve their efficiency and cut down on costs by allowing Atlantic City Electric to remotely control their heating or air conditioning temperatures at certain selected times during the day.
Atlantic City Electric Customer Technology
Atlantic City Electric has its own mobile apps and account services that are designed to help customers make smarter energy choices. These programs offer tools to help customers calculate potential savings they could experience by making simple changes and home improvements. These apps also feature tools that allow customers to see where their energy dollars are spent, analyze their individual usage and compare their energy costs to other users in their area.
Comparing PSE&G Electricity Rates
New Jersey has a completely deregulated energy market and has had one since the 1990s. This means that while consumers can receive their energy from Atlantic City Electric, they also have the power to choose a different retail supplier in their area. This means these consumers can shop for plans from local, privately-owned, retail energy providers.
Since New Jersey residents have the right to choose under the state-appointed initiative called New Jersey Choice, customers can either keep their service where it is (at their utility) or shop around for a different energy supplier.  Customers who choose not to shop for a new energy supplier can continue to purchase their electricity directly from Atlantic City Electric.
All utilities in New Jersey are still monitored by the government to insure they are offering fair prices on their energy products.

Utilities in Deregulated Markets

In numerous states across the country, the introduction of electricity deregulation brought about great change for both residential and commercial consumers, as well as their utilities.
With the birth of deregulation, new retail electricity providers (REPs) opened up creating large competitive markets in states like Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania — to name a few.  Consumers were given the opportunity to shop around and purchase electricity from companies other than their local utility, sometimes drastically reducing their monthly electric bills.
Major Utilities in Deregulated Markets
Local utilities still have major responsibilities in deregulated states and areas, regardless if a consumer purchases their electricity from them or a local retail electricity provider.

Grid Operations
It’s the responsibility of the local utility to handle all of the operation and distribution involved with connecting homes and businesses to the power grid.
Utilities have grid operators constantly monitoring the stability and safety of the grid, assuring everything is functioning properly at all times for consumers.  This isn’t the responsibility of individual retail energy providers (REPs).  These companies simply buy energy generation and sell that electricity to individual residents and businesses.
Distribution
Regardless of the supplier of electricity, your current local utility will still handle the distribution of the electricity to your home or business.  You’ll notice a distribution portion of your electric bill with charges — these charges come from your utility.  A distribution portion of an energy statement makes up roughly 20% of the total bill.
Ultimately, it’s important to remember that while suppliers buy and sell energy, it is still the responsibility of the utility to distribute that energy to each individual property.
Provider of Last Resort (POLR)
Utilities in deregulated states are often still required to act as the Provider of Last Resort.
Essentially, the utility must act as a “back up” electric service in each of the areas that they cover. Many times this means that the utility will still make certain a property has electricity, even if the owner of the property has not purchased a plan from a supplier, or if they forget to renew or transfer electricity service.  In these situations, the utility will step in.
POLR comes with higher than usual rates and is only meant to be a temporary solution.
Maintenance and Repairs
Utilities, regardless if they’re located in a regulated or deregulated area, is still responsible for the power lines, grids and poles found throughout their territory. REPs are not in charge of this equipment; it is still owned and managed by each utility.
This means that when there’s a power outage or damage done to one of these poles from a storm, car accident, etc., it’s the utility?s job to fix them.  Customers often think they need to call their REP during outages and emergencies such as this, but they instead need to call their utility directly as they always have.
In addition to handling emergency repairs, utilities are also responsible for providing routine maintenance to their infrastructure to ensure it continues to function properly.

Hotel Deals: Up To 60% Off Hotels!
Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
