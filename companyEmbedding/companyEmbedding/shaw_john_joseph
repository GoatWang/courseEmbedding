Exe: Eliz: Shaw, if she stands to the will; if not, son John
Shaw. Wit: Thomas Hatton, Nathan Brooks, John Sheyin Prob.
1-19-1748 (sic)


Notes for ELIZABETH JENKINS:
The birth/identity of Elizabeth is provided, largely because of
the generosity of Elizabeth's godfather, the bachelor tailor
George Bellows.  Bellows gave a mare to Elizabeth and requested
that its mark be recorded, an inaction that she was not yet of
age.    Her husband, John's will names six children.  The
eldest John Shaw, was of age; the exact ages of the others are
set out in Elizabeth Shaw's account :  Elizabeth, born 20 Sept.
1739; Joseph, born 9 Feb. 1742/3; Charles, born 20 Aug. 1745.
At the request of Elizabeth Shaw, the following lease was
recorded on 03 May 1751 .  22 Apr 1751 from William Courts of
Charles Co., Gent., to Elizabeth Shaw of Charles Co. the lease
of part of the tract of land that sd Courts now lives on called
Burrough Hall, for the space of 17 years.  The bounds of the
land were laid off by sd Courts in the presence of Thomas
Howard, John Bateman, and Joseph Bateman.  Courts allows sd
Elizabeth Shaw the privilege of clearing all such grounds as is
included in sd bounds.  Sd Elizabeth Shaw obliges herself to
pay sd William Courts 900 lbs of tobacco yearly.  If Elizabeth
Shaw should die before the expiration of the term of 17 years,
after her death, I allow her son, John Shaw, the same privilege
of possessing the premises afd for the rest of the term of the
lease, then the lease to be void.  If John Shaw dies before the
end of the lease, then the lease to be void.  Signed - Wm.
Courts, Elizabeth (E her mark) Shaw, Wit - Thos. Howard, Henry
Thompson. This appears to be the last known record for
Elizabeth and there has been no record of her death or of an
administration of an estate.

CORE VALUES






 
 
 
1




















Shaw’s people, from the project manager to the laborers, all did a fantastic job and
I wholeheartedly recommend them for any project anywhere.
J. SHEA




Shaw was wonderful to work with; they were pleasant, attentive and thorough.
With their assistance we were able to achieve the goals we outlined for our project on-time
and within our allotted budget. We would enthusiastically work with them on a future endeavor.
ENGLEWOOD HOUSING AUTHORITY




I never cease to be impressed with the dedication of your people.
BOETTCHER & CO.




Colin was Project Manager, and Dave was Superintendent on construction of the Mount Loretto multifamily housing development.
They were outstanding in their service to us over the more than two years we worked on this project.
They delivered a wonderful housing development on time and below budget.
CATHOLIC CHARITIES




The project construction team with Shaw Construction, in a highly competitive selection process,
expressed an understanding of the necessity for the compressed construction schedule…
Shaw demonstrated a willingness and ability to go far beyond the norm in accommodating the tight schedule.
Their ability to seek out and enact time saving construction methods was integral to the success of the project.
This out-of-the-box attitude and “can-do” spirit expressed by the team allowed this project to have the
great degree of success that it did during construction.
UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER




You’ve got to listen while I compliment and tell you that your team was first class, and that our
magnificent concert hall is a testimony to the quality that you and your company represent.
Thank you!
MUSIC ASSOCIATION OF ASPEN




Shaw’s team has eagerly demonstrated their desire to put hard work into finding workable
solutions for our housing project.  The team has been invaluable in helping us understand,
and work through some of the difficulties of the rezoning and development plans for the site.
I have been able to call upon them to help me in providing costs and narrative for several grants,
as well as to work through tough value engineering calls.  They are direct and honest.
AURORA HOUSING AUTHORITY




The Arrabelle at Vail Square is an incredible project. Witnessing Shaw’s professionalism
and commitment to excellence within that context was a real gift. I am lucky to be
working with the quality and caliber of people that make this company what it is.
VAIL RESORTS




From the day we selected Shaw Construction as a general contractor,
their services have exceeded our expectations in all areas of contractor services.
WINTER PARK RECREATIONAL ASSOCIATION




Shaw Construction delivered the Intrawest Corporate Offices build-out with an attention to 
detail that created an outstanding work environment for our Intrawest Denver team. 
And, they were on schedule and under budget.
INTRAWEST




Shaw Construction was the right choice for Observatory Park. 
They provided a quality product on time and on budget.
You can’t ask for more.
DAE CONSTRUCTION SERVICES




We here at St. Joe’s are just amazed at how fast our new Parish Hall is getting to completion.
Your guys, who meet with us on a regular basis – Sam, David & Mihai – are all equally ‘great guys’.
I admire their dedication, work ethic and pleasant personalities.
FATHER EDMUNDO
Parish Priest, St. Joseph Catholic Parish




Working with Shaw at CMU has been remarkably easy. They are great team members and collaborate with the
University and design team each step of the way. Shaw has continuously made our budget and schedule goals
while keeping the campus safe and accessible during construction.
TIM FOSTER
President, Mesa University
