Saw Mill Capital and Falcon Investment Advisors Announce Partnership with David C. Westgate to Acquire Industrial Manufacturing Subsidiaries






Apr 22, 2016, 9:04am EDT














BRIARCLIFF MANOR, N.Y., April 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Saw Mill Capital ("Saw Mill") and Falcon Investment Advisors ("Falcon") today announced their partnership with David C. Westgate to pursue investments in select manufacturing businesses ranging from $400 million to $1 billion in revenue. 
Westgate most recently led Jason Incorporated, a diversified global manufacturer of seating, automotive acoustics, industrial finishing and components products, and its successor company, Jason Industries, Inc. (JASN), as chief executive officer (CEO) from 2004 to 2015. Saw Mill acquired Jason Incorporated in 2000, and Falcon invested additional capital in 2010 to support growth and acquisitions. Saw Mill and Falcon substantially exited this investment in 2014. 
Scott Rivard, Partner of Saw Mill, said, "Dave is an exceptional leader and hands-on operator with whom we have had a long and profitable relationship. We have seen firsthand his ability to drive operational excellence and are thrilled to have the opportunity to partner with him again."
Saw Mill and Falcon seek to acquire divisions or subsidiaries of public or large private manufacturing companies that serve a wide range of industrial markets in the United States and abroad and require operational improvements and/or senior management transition. John Schnabel, Partner of Falcon, added, "We are looking for new investment opportunities where Dave can instill a culture of continuous improvement to drive growth and operating leverage, like he did consistently at Jason."  Saw Mill will invest from its newly raised fund, Saw Mill Capital Partners II, LP, while Falcon will invest from Falcon Strategic Partners V, LP. 
David Westgate commented, "It is a pleasure to again be working with the great teams at Saw Mill and Falcon. At Jason, our partnership led to a rapid acceleration of growth in multiple markets and geographies. We are today eager to apply this winning mix to global manufacturing businesses that have been under-capitalized and/or under-managed, with the goal of uncovering obscured value that will drive a similar level of success." 
Prior to joining Jason as CEO, Westgate served as President and Chief Executive Officer at Rieter Automotive Systems, a leading global supplier of systems solutions for the automotive industry, as well as President and Chief Executive Officer at Solvay Automotive, Inc./Inergy Automotive Systems LLC, a leading global supplier of fuel and air management systems for the automotive industry.

PRESS RELEASE
March 23, 2016 10:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time
FORT LEE, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Trivergance, LLC, a leading independent sponsor, in partnership with Falcon Investment Advisors, LLC and Landon Capital Partners, today announced the acquisition of Clarus Commerce from global venture capital and growth equity investment firm, Norwest Venture Partners. The management team at Clarus has built a dynamic company that capitalizes on the rapidly growing market opportunity at the intersection of eCommerce and subscription-based loyalty and rewards solutions. Specifically, Clarus has developed and manages a proprietary, flexible and scalable membership and benefit management technology platform. This platform delivers to consumers and its “white-label” partners a suite of valuable benefits that drive enhanced loyalty and customer engagement. Clarus offers its own portfolio of subscription products as well as a growing portfolio of custom “white-label” loyalty programs that Clarus executes in a holistic and turn-key manner on behalf of its eCommerce retailers, payment companies and other client partners. 





Amongst other products, Clarus’ flagship product, Freeshipping.com, offers a suite of benefits to consumers including free shipping, 10% cash back, price comparison, price guarantee and other valuable savings across a consortium of over 1,500 of the world’s largest online retailers. The company has an extensive roadmap of feature and benefit enhancements, which will drive additional value to consumers and to its “white-label” clients.
Marc Byron, CEO of Trivergance says, “We are very proud to have sponsored and led this transaction. We believe Clarus represents the next platform opportunity for Trivergance to continue delivering on our track record of success in what we call the ‘Supply Chain of Customer Engagement.’ We have had great success in identifying trends early in these sectors and capitalizing on these trends to rapidly scale companies and create tremendous value. Trivergance acts as an accelerator to help achieve outsized returns and do it faster.”
Mr. Byron continues, “With regard to Clarus, we see a tectonic shift coming in how brands and marketers engage and reward prospects and customers, and how strategies and programs like this are funded. Gone soon are the days where a loyalty program is funded solely by the brand in a vacuum, resulting in a major cost center. Clarus’ suite of benefits and emerging solutions, in combination with specific intellectual property and operational know how of Trivergance, will deliver exciting innovations to this vast and highly fragmented market. Overall, the Clarus platform provides a ‘turn-key’ loyalty and membership management solution to its eCommerce and client partners that can be customized and rapidly implemented, increasing loyalty while at the same time driving profits to their bottom lines.”
Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus comments, “We had five great years with Norwest, which includes collaborating closely with Jon Kossow and David Su who have been active board members and great partners. Not only did they support us in materially growing the company to operational maturity, but we substantially grew both the top and bottom lines. With our new capital and operational partners, we can further scale the business and innovate the sector in ways that our product and platform yield significant and ongoing benefits to our consumers, eCommerce partners and ‘white label’ clients alike. The adoption of our first and core product Freeshipping.com is extensive across a network of more than 1,500 leading online retailers and other brands. They are hungry for further innovation that significantly drives more customer engagement, transactions, profitability, and ultimately more lifetime value. The industry can count on us to lead the way forward in re-inventing the dynamic sectors of loyalty, membership and rewards.”
Rafael Fogel, Partner at Falcon says, “We’re pleased to be partnering with Trivergance to support this great company and management team in the loyalty and rewards management space.”
Chris Sullivan of Landon Capital Partners adds, “We are delighted that this transaction will combine the Clarus team with the Trivergance team that brings unparalleled experience and success in direct to consumer marketing businesses over the past 20 years. We believe the Fortune 500 relationships Trivergance will bring to Clarus can further accelerate the company’s established outstanding track record of growth.”
Senior debt financing for this transaction has been provided by BBVA Compass Bank and Whitehorse Capital. Clarus Commerce was advised by Sanjay Chadda of Petsky Prunier, the leading investment bank for middle market transactions in the marketing, digital, eCommerce and related sectors.

About - Falcon Investment Advisors

Home > About About
Formed in July 2000, Falcon Investment Advisors, LLC is a private equity firm that invests subordinated debt and equity capital in leading middle market companies

Falcon manages over $2.8 billion of capital and is actively seeking to invest $25 to $75 million per transaction through its current fund, Falcon Strategic Partners V, LP.
Falcon has extensive leveraged finance and private equity experience and has earned a reputation for being flexible, creative and responsive. The partners average over 25 years of investing experience and have spent nearly half that time together at Falcon.
