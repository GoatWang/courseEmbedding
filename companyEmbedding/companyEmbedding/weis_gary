This means we will all be able to get our Kakadu from a local caravan dealer or an agent who can come to you for a measure and quote, which is a first for the industry. Growth has been planned to allow for a roll out of Distributorships and Agencies across Australia which will allow customers to view and buy their annexe and accessories in their local area. Eight outlets have been established in Victoria, NSW and Queensland with Adelaide and Perth to come online soon. Many large caravan and camper retail outlets will now sell the entire range of Kakadu products and for more personlised service they are establishing Agents who can visit buyers in their home or at the caravan site. Kakadu Annexes have the position of the leading annexe manufacturer in Australia and the Kakadu style annexe is recognised as the industry benchmark for quality and style. Kakadu Annexes have recently opened their purpose built facility enabling them to provide an even greater range of quality annexes, awnings and accessories to Australian caravaning and camper enthusiasts.The facility features a display centre and shop front which includes an accessories and parts division and the factory has state of the art systems to streamline production, support lean manufacturing and provide further improvements in quality and value for money.  The Kakadu website has also undergone redevelopment over this time with the addition of a shopping facility and payment gateway which allows consumers to choose products and make purchases while you are touring, with delivery offered to their current or next locations, another first to make it easy when on the road.

Weis & Dr Gary Test - Trading Psychology Edge -

































































Trading Psychology EdgeHelping you develop the mental and technical sides of trading "The real edge separating wealthy traders from failed ones is their mental approach to markets...  Dr. Dayton provides a step-by-step method for mastering the last true 'edge' traders have for making money in the markets." Tim Bourquin, co-founder, The Traders Expo and TraderInterviews.com

Coming Soon!
Wyckoff Wizzard David Weis Reveal New High-Odds Trade Setups
Team up with Dr. Gary to Deliver New Market Insights
 
Following the invention of the Weis Wave, Wyckoff Wizzard David Weis now developed new high-odds trade setups and for the first time, David is to reveal these high-odds trade setups to public in this webinar hosted by TradingPsychologyEdge!
David’s new trade setups are an intraday trading strategy called “Springs & UpThrusts in Motion.” David teams up with Dr. Gary to introduce these new trade setups and Dr. Gary will present specific tactics and trade setups to enter an unfolding trend change in its early stages.
New Trade Setups
David’s excellent new Springs & UpThrusts in Motion strategy allows you to trade close to a turning point where the risk is minimal. Precise rules are employed for determining if a spring or up-thrust meets the prescribed form. On an average day, one can easily survey 5 or 6 active stocks or futures contracts and find these setups.  You don’t have to trade anything else!
David has disclosed this strategy to his mentoring students and most of them have used it successfully. One student, for example, has achieved a 70% success rate with a rigid plan for taking short-term profits. Another student created a scan based on this technique. Small and large traders, former floor traders and a fund manager have benefited from what you will be shown. The Weis Wave software is not needed to find the trades in motion. It works with great pure simplicity.
David’s Springs & UpThrusts in motion is a new concept with specifics different from the normal spring or upthrust.  It is appropriate for both day trading and swing trading.
Early Trend Change Trade Setups
Dr. Gary will show you how to enter a potential trend change early.  He will detail all the signs we look for in identifying a trend making a change into a new trend and show you three complete trade setups with all the details you need to trade them confidently.  Keep in mind, we don’t use indicators, so the background conditions, price behavior and volume will be explained clearly and in detail.  These trade setups work well for both buying and selling the market.
Dr. Gary will show traders how to enter a potential trend change aggressively and how to tell and what to do if it isn’t working out as anticipated.  For more conservative traders, Dr. Gary will show trade setup and entry techniques which still put you in a trend change early, but a little later in the trend change process at lesser risk.  Aggressive traders who have entered early, can use this more conservative entry as a place to add to and pyramid their trade for greater profits.

Early life and education[edit]
Weiss grew up in New York City and attended public schools, including the Bronx High School of Science. He received degrees from the City College of New York and the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.[1]
Career[edit]
Weiss wrote for Barron's magazine, before joining Business Week magazine in 1986.[1]
Between 1986 and 2004 Weiss wrote investigative articles for Business Week, including cover stories on the dangers of the Internet, as well as stock fraud and improprieties by brokerages large and small. His articles described widespread improper trading at the American Stock Exchange and broke the story of the bond trading scandal at Salomon Brothers in 1991. Weiss also wrote essays and articles critical of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators,[2] and in 1995 a cover story exploring the early manifestations of online investing.[3]
In testimony before a U.S. Senate committee in 1991, Warren Buffett, then temporarily running Salomon Brothers, said that he learned of a bond trading scandal by reading Weiss' article in Business Week. At the time the article came out, he said, Salomon Brothers was denying a scandal was taking place. Buffett said, "I was not that aware personally about the squeeze, not until I did read that Business Week story."[4]
Weiss authored a cover story in the April 1, 1996 edition, titled "Fall of the Wizard," that was critical of Julian Robertson's performance and behavior as manager of hedge fund Tiger Management. In response, Robertson sued Weiss and BusinessWeek for $1 billion for defamation. The suit was settled with no money changing hands, and BusinessWeek standing by the substance of its reporting.[5][6] After two years of poor performance, the Tiger funds closed in 2000.[7]
In 1998, Weiss wrote a Business Week commentary calling for strict limits on leverage, saying "limiting leverage may make some high-tech investment strategies difficult or impossible. It might also cut into the derivatives business of banks and Wall Street firms. If that's the case--well, so be it."[8]
Weiss's "Mob on Wall Street" and other Business Week stories were praised by then-FBI Director Louis Freeh, in a letter published by Business Week in December 2000. Freeh wrote: "Gary Weiss has done our nation an invaluable service by reporting the manipulation of the stock market by elements of organized crime. By outlining specific stocks and stock brokerage firms that were controlled by organized crime, he opened the door for FBI investigations in Florida and in New York, and for that we owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude."[9]
In 2006, Weiss became a founding member of Project Klebnikov, a global media alliance organized by investigative journalist Richard Behar investigating the July 2004 murder of Paul Klebnikov, editor-in-chief of the Russian edition of Forbes magazine, and continuing the investigative work that he started.[10]
From November 2006 through March 2008 Weiss was a "muckraker" columnist for Forbes.com .[11][12]
Weiss has been a contributor to The New York Times op-ed page and to Salon.[1] In 2007 he criticized Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne and his campaign against naked short selling in numerous articles.[13][14][15][16]
From October 2008 until 2010 Weiss was an editor for Condé Nast Portfolio . After the closing of Portfolio, Weiss continued to write for the surviving Portfolio website, writing a weekly column, "The Weiss File," through December 2010.[17]
Books[edit]
Born to Steal (2003) focuses on Mafia-linked stockbroker Louis Pasciuto and Wall Street firms infiltrated by organized crime in the 1990s.[18]
Wall Street Versus America (2006) is an "attack, using humor and ridicule" on the morality of Wall Street, its regulators and the financial press. The book is critical of hedge funds, mutual funds, the Wall Street securities arbitration process, the New York Stock Exchange, and former Securities and Exchange Commission chairmen Arthur Levitt and William H. Donaldson.[19] The book is also critical of campaigns against naked short selling,[20] and takes a dim view of much financial journalism.[21] Weiss singled out Bear Stearns in his criticism, and his comments on anti-naked-shorting activists provoked threats.[22]
Ayn Rand Nation (2012) is an analysis of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and its influence on the political and economic environment in the United States.[23] George Monbiot, writing in The Guardian, argues that Weiss shows in the book that Rand 'has become to the new right what Karl Marx once was to the left: a demigod at the head of a chiliastic cult.'[24]

Donaldson.[19] The book is also critical of campaigns against naked short selling,[20] and takes a dim view of much financial journalism.[21] Weiss singled out Bear Stearns in his criticism, and his comments on anti-naked-shorting activists provoked threats.[22]
Ayn Rand Nation (2012) is an analysis of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and its influence on the political and economic environment in the United States.[23] George Monbiot, writing in The Guardian, argues that Weiss shows in the book that Rand 'has become to the new right what Karl Marx once was to the left: a demigod at the head of a chiliastic cult.'[24]

Early life and education[edit]
Weiss grew up in New York City and attended public schools, including the Bronx High School of Science. He received degrees from the City College of New York and the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.[1]
Career[edit]
Weiss wrote for Barron's magazine, before joining Business Week magazine in 1986.[1]
Between 1986 and 2004 Weiss wrote investigative articles for Business Week, including cover stories on the dangers of the Internet, as well as stock fraud and improprieties by brokerages large and small. His articles described widespread improper trading at the American Stock Exchange and broke the story of the bond trading scandal at Salomon Brothers in 1991. Weiss also wrote essays and articles critical of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators,[2] and in 1995 a cover story exploring the early manifestations of online investing.[3]
In testimony before a U.S. Senate committee in 1991, Warren Buffett, then temporarily running Salomon Brothers, said that he learned of a bond trading scandal by reading Weiss' article in Business Week. At the time the article came out, he said, Salomon Brothers was denying a scandal was taking place. Buffett said, "I was not that aware personally about the squeeze, not until I did read that Business Week story."[4]
Weiss authored a cover story in the April 1, 1996 edition, titled "Fall of the Wizard," that was critical of Julian Robertson's performance and behavior as manager of hedge fund Tiger Management. In response, Robertson sued Weiss and BusinessWeek for $1 billion for defamation. The suit was settled with no money changing hands, and BusinessWeek standing by the substance of its reporting.[5][6] After two years of poor performance, the Tiger funds closed in 2000.[7]
In 1998, Weiss wrote a Business Week commentary calling for strict limits on leverage, saying "limiting leverage may make some high-tech investment strategies difficult or impossible. It might also cut into the derivatives business of banks and Wall Street firms. If that's the case--well, so be it."[8]
Weiss's "Mob on Wall Street" and other Business Week stories were praised by then-FBI Director Louis Freeh, in a letter published by Business Week in December 2000. Freeh wrote: "Gary Weiss has done our nation an invaluable service by reporting the manipulation of the stock market by elements of organized crime. By outlining specific stocks and stock brokerage firms that were controlled by organized crime, he opened the door for FBI investigations in Florida and in New York, and for that we owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude."[9]
In 2006, Weiss became a founding member of Project Klebnikov, a global media alliance organized by investigative journalist Richard Behar investigating the July 2004 murder of Paul Klebnikov, editor-in-chief of the Russian edition of Forbes magazine, and continuing the investigative work that he started.[10]
From November 2006 through March 2008 Weiss was a "muckraker" columnist for Forbes.com .[11][12]
Weiss has been a contributor to The New York Times op-ed page and to Salon.[1] In 2007 he criticized Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne and his campaign against naked short selling in numerous articles.[13][14][15][16]
From October 2008 until 2010 Weiss was an editor for Condé Nast Portfolio . After the closing of Portfolio, Weiss continued to write for the surviving Portfolio website, writing a weekly column, "The Weiss File," through December 2010.[17]
Books[edit]
Born to Steal (2003) focuses on Mafia-linked stockbroker Louis Pasciuto and Wall Street firms infiltrated by organized crime in the 1990s.[18]
Wall Street Versus America (2006) is an "attack, using humor and ridicule" on the morality of Wall Street, its regulators and the financial press.

Born to Steal (2003) focuses on Mafia-linked stockbroker Louis Pasciuto and Wall Street firms infiltrated by organized crime in the 1990s.[18]
Wall Street Versus America (2006) is an "attack, using humor and ridicule" on the morality of Wall Street, its regulators and the financial press. The book is critical of hedge funds, mutual funds, the Wall Street securities arbitration process, the New York Stock Exchange, and former Securities and Exchange Commission chairmen Arthur Levitt and William H. Donaldson.[19] The book is also critical of campaigns against naked short selling,[20] and takes a dim view of much financial journalism.[21] Weiss singled out Bear Stearns in his criticism, and his comments on anti-naked-shorting activists provoked threats.[22]
Ayn Rand Nation (2012) is an analysis of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and its influence on the political and economic environment in the United States.[23] George Monbiot, writing in The Guardian, argues that Weiss shows in the book that Rand 'has become to the new right what Karl Marx once was to the left: a demigod at the head of a chiliastic cult.'[24]

Work Environment Impact Scale (WEIS) Version 2.0, 1998 
Authors: Renee A. Moore-Corner, Gary Kielhofner, and Linda Olson                                                                                                                                                 
            


The WEIS allows a client and therapist to identify environmental characteristics that facilitate successful employment experiences. Factors that inhibit worker performance and satisfaction and which may require accommodation are also addressed in order to maximize the "fit" of the worker and their skills to the job environment. 
The WEIS is a semi-structured interview and rating scale designed to assist the therapist to gather information on how individuals with physical or psychosocial disabilities experience and perceive their work environments. Typical candidates for this assessment are persons who are experiencing difficulty on the job, and persons whose work is interrupted by an injury or episode of illness. The 17 items reflect the social and physical environment, supports, temporal demands, objects used, and daily job functions. 
Note: This product includes access to the full manual. After the assessment is purchased, the printable version is available by clicking into your "My MOHO" tab (at the top of this website), then "Create a New Evaluation", select the appropriate assessment and click start, click on the "Full Assessement" link in the "links and resources" box.
