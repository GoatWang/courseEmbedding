Meet Our Founder


 


Curtis W. Mewbourne, a native of Shreveport, Louisiana, obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Oklahoma, where he has been honored as a Distinguished Graduate. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Army and working as a petroleum engineer in industry, he founded Mewbourne Oil Company in 1965. Mewbourne Oil is one of the most successful privately owned oil and gas producers in America. Mr. Mewbourne continues to operate the company privately.
In recognition of his longtime support, the University of Oklahoma named the Mewbourne School of Petroleum and Geological Engineering in his honor in May of 2000, and granted him the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 2002. On November 2, 2007, the Mewbourne College of Earth & Energy was named in his honor and he was given the Trailblazer Award for his professional achievements and lifetime commitment to the energy center.

Mewbourne Securities, Inc., a Texas corporation (the "Dealer
Manager"), has
entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with the Managing Partner
under which
the Dealer Manager is appointed the exclusive agent of the Managing
Partner and
of the Partnerships to form a group of National Association of
Securities
Dealers, Inc. member firms who will solicit subscribers for the
purchase of
Interests.

     The
following are the terms on which the Managing Partner, on behalf of
the
Partnership, and the Dealer Manager appoint you and you agree to
such
appointment to solicit subscribers for the purchase of
Interests:

    
Section 1. Appointment as Soliciting Dealer. On the basis of
the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement, but
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, you are
hereby appointed
to serve as a soliciting dealer ("Soliciting Dealer") during the
Offering Period
(as defined below) for Interests in both Partnerships for the
purpose of finding
subscribers for the Interests through a public offering, at the
price of $1,000
per Interest, with a minimum subscription of twenty Interests
($20,000), as
described in the

Mewbourne Development 06-07 Drilling Program
Soliciting Dealer Agreement
_____________, 2006
Page 2


Prospectus. The "Offering Period" (as such term is used in this
Agreement) for
Interests in Mewbourne Energy Partners 06-A, L.P. will commence on
or about the
date on which the Registration Statement is declared effective and
will end no
later than December 31, 2006 unless the Managing Partner
accelerates or delays
such termination date. The Offering Period for Interests in
Mewbourne Energy
Partners 07-A, L.P. will commence in 2007 and will end no later
than December
31, 2007. MD has the right in its sole and absolute discretion to

subscriptions
for the Interests during each Offering Period and until the earlier
of (i) the
termination of the Offering Period or (ii) the Closing (as
hereinafter defined)
with respect to that Partnership. Neither your acceptance of that
appointment
nor this Agreement shall constitute you and MD or a Partnership as
an
association, partnership, unincorporated business or other separate
entity. If
an offering for Interests in a Partnership is commenced and
subscriptions funds
of $5,000,000 or more are not received by the termination of that
Partnership's
Offering Period with respect to Interests in that Partnership, all
subscription
funds received by the termination of such Offering Period with
respect to
Interests in that Partnership shall be returned in full to the
subscribers,
together with any interest earned thereon, if any (as provided in
the
Prospectus), and this Agreement as to that Partnership will
terminate without
obligation on your part or on the part of MD, except that (a) you
will promptly,
upon notice, transmit to MD any sales commissions and marketing
fees received by
you pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof, and (b) the indemnification
and
contribution provisions of Section 9 hereof shall continue after
such
termination of this Agreement. In the event that you violate the
terms,
conditions, agreements or warranties herein, the Managing Partner
or the Dealer
Manager, in their sole and absolute discretion, may terminate this
Agreement.

    
Section 2. Representations and Warranties of MD and the Dealer
Manager. MD,
in its individual capacity and in its capacity as Managing Partner,
and the
Dealer Manager, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant
to you that:

     (a)
In the name and on behalf of the Partnerships, MD has prepared
and
filed with the Commission the Registration Statement (including the
Prospectus)

partnership duly
formed and validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and will be
duly qualified or registered as a foreign limited partnership or
otherwise
qualified as a limited partnership in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of
the activities conducted by it or the nature of the assets owned by
it make such
qualification necessary (except where the failure to so qualify or
register
would not have a material adverse effect on the Partnership or the
rights or
liabilities of its General or Limited Partners). In addition, such
Partnership
shall have full and adequate partnership power and partnership
authority to
enter into and perform this Agreement and the related Program
Agreement and to
own its properties and to conduct its business as proposed in the
Prospectus.

     (c)
MD is, and at all times through the Closing Date will be, a
corporation, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State
of Delaware with full and adequate corporate power and corporate
authority to
enter into and perform this Agreement and the Agreement of
Partnership and to
own its properties and to conduct its business as presently
conducted and as
proposed in the Prospectus to be conducted.

     (d)
Each subscriber for Limited Partner Interests will become a
Limited
Partner of the Partnership entitled to all the rights of a Limited
Partner under
the Agreement of Partnership for the Partnership and the Delaware
Act upon (i)
payment of the consideration for those Limited Partner Interests
specified in
that subscriber's Subscription Agreement and (ii) acceptance by the
Managing
Partner of that subscriber as a Limited Partner. Each subscriber
for General

for as contemplated by the Prospectus, will represent validly
authorized and
duly issued Interests and those Interests will conform in all
material respects
to the statements relating thereto contained in the Prospectus,
including the
Form of Agreement of Partnership attached as Exhibit A thereto.

     (e)
This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized by MD and
the
Dealer Manager. MD and the Dealer Manager have duly executed and
delivered this
Agreement, which constitutes a valid and binding agreement of MD
and the Dealer
Manager enforceable in accordance with its terms (except to the
extent that the
enforceability of the indemnification provisions of Section 9
hereof may be
limited under federal securities laws or to the extent the
enforceability of
this Agreement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting the right of creditors
generally).

     (f)
The Commission has not issued any order preventing or suspending
the
use of the Prospectus.

     (g)
From the time the Registration Statement initially became
effective
through the Closing Date, the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus did and
will comply in all material respects with the provisions of the
Act, and neither
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus nor any Sales
Literature (as
hereinafter defined) contains or will contain any untrue statement
of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not
misleading; provided, however, that the representations and
warranties contained
in this subsection (g) shall not apply to statements in, or
omissions from, the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Sales Literature
based upon and in
conformity with information furnished to MD or a Partnership by you
in writing
specifically for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus
or Sales
Literature.

     (h)
Based upon the opinion of Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., counsel for
MD, and
subject to the assumptions and representations expressed therein,
under existing
federal income tax laws and regulations the Partnership, upon its
formation,
will be classified as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes. A
Partnership, at the related Closing, will be classified as a
partnership for
federal income tax purposes, and at all times subsequent hereto, MD
will use its
best efforts to maintain the status of the Partnership as a
partnership for
federal income tax purposes.

     (i)
Except as disclosed in the Prospectus, there is no litigation
or
governmental proceeding pending or, to the best knowledge of MD,
threatened that
involves the offering of the Interests or any of the properties or
businesses of
MD that would, if adversely decided, materially and adversely
affect
(financially or otherwise) the operation of the business of the
Partnership, MD
or the offering.

     (j)
MD is not in violation of the Agreements of Partnership or in
material
default in the performance of any obligation, agreement or
condition contained
in any agreement by which a Partnership is bound. The execution and
delivery of
this Agreement and the Agreements of Partnership, the fulfillment
of the terms
set forth herein and therein and the consummation of the
transactions
contemplated herein and therein and in the Prospectus will not
conflict with or
constitute a breach of or material default under the Agreements of
Partnership
or under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of MD or under
any other
agreement, indenture or instrument by which a Partnership or MD is
bound or, to
the best knowledge of MD, any law, rule, regulation, order or
decree of any
court or any governmental body or administrative agency applicable
to MD or a
Partnership.

     (k)
The financial information (including without limitation the
balance
sheets and any accompanying notes and schedules) presented in the
Prospectus
concerning MD presents fairly MD's financial position as of the
dates thereof in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and there
has been,
and through the Closing Date shall be, no material adverse change
in its
financial condition since the date of that information.

     (l)
There has been no material adverse change in the condition,
business or
properties of MD, financial or otherwise, from that on the latest
dates as of
which such condition, business or properties are set forth in the
Prospectus,
except as referred to therein, and such properties and business
substantially
conform and shall at the

Closing Date with respect to the related Partnership substantially
conform to
the descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus.

     (m)
MD will timely apply, on behalf of the Partnership, to the
Internal
Revenue Service for a tax shelter registration number and, if such
a number is
received, will furnish such number to the General and Limited
Partners of such
Partnership within a reasonable time after their admission to the
Partnership or
within a reasonable time after the Partnership has received such
number,
whichever occurs later.

    
Section 3. Covenants and Representations of Soliciting Dealer. You
covenant
with and represent to MD that:

     (a)
You are, and at all times through the last Closing Date will be,
a
corporation, validly existing and in good standing as a corporation
under the
laws of the jurisdiction set forth on the signature page hereof,
with full and
adequate corporate power and corporate authority to enter into and
perform this
Agreement.

     (b)
This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized by you. You
have

net worth,
annual income or other standards applicable to that person as set
forth in the
Subscription Agreement.

     (d)
You will deliver a copy of the Prospectus, containing such legends

specific oil and gas prospect or to refer to any such oil and gas
prospect in
any analysis or report on the Interests prepared by you or on your
behalf.

     (e)
You will make offers to sell Interests to, sell to or solicit

(a) A member engaged in a fixed price offering, who purchases
or
    
arranges the purchase of securities taken in trade, shall purchase
the
    
securities at a fair market price at the time of purchase or shall
act as
    
agent in the sale of such securities and charge a normal
commission
      therefor.

         
(b) When used in this Rule:

              
(1) the term "taken in trade" means the purchase by a member as
         
principal, or as agent for the account of another, of a security
from
         
a customer pursuant to an agreement or understanding that the
customer
         
purchase securities from the member which are part of a fixed
price
         
offering.

              
(2) the term "fair market price" means a price not higher than
         
the price at which the securities would be purchased from the
customer
         
or from a similarly situated customer in the ordinary course of
         
business by a dealer in such securities in transactions of
similar
         
size and having similar characteristics but not involving a
security
         
taken in trade.

              
(3) the term "normal commission" means an amount of commission
         
which the member would normally charge to that customer or a
similarly
         
situated customer in the ordinary course of business in
transactions
         
of similar size and having similar characteristics but not
involving a
         
security taken in trade.

         
(c) For purposes of this Rule a member shall be:

              
(1) deemed, with respect to securities other than common
stocks,
         
to have taken such securities in trade at a fair market price when
the
         
price paid is not higher than the highest independent bid for
the
         
securities at the time of purchase, if such bid quotations for
the
         
securities are readily available.

              
(2) presumed, with respect to common stocks, to have taken such
         
common stocks in trade at a fair market price when the price paid
is
         
not higher than the highest independent bid for the securities at
the
         
time of purchase, if such bid quotations for the securities are
         
readily available.

              
(3) presumed to have taken a security in trade at a price
higher
         
than a fair market price when the price paid is higher than the
lowest
         
independent offer for the securities at the time of purchase, if
such
         
offer quotations for the securities are readily available.

         
(d) A member, in connection with every transaction subject to
this
    
Rule, shall with respect to:

              
(1) common stocks, which are traded on a national securities
         
exchange or for which quotations are entered in an automated
quotation
         
system, obtain the necessary bid and offer quotations from the
         
national securities exchange or from the automated quotation
system;
         
and

              
(2) other securities and common stocks not included in
         
subparagraph (1) above, obtain directly or with the assistance of
an
         
independent agent bid and offer quotations from two or more
         
independent dealers relating to the securities to be taken in
trade
         
or, if such quotations are not readily available, exercise its
best
         
efforts to obtain such quotations with respect to securities
having
         
similar characteristics and of similar quality as those to be taken
in
         
trade.

In connection with the sale of securities which are part of a
fixed
    
price offering:

         
(a) A member may not grant or receive selling concessions,
discounts,
     or
other allowances except as consideration for services rendered
in
    
distribution and may not grant such concessions, discounts or
other
    
allowances to anyone other than a broker or dealer actually engaged
in the
    
investment banking or securities business; provided, however, that
nothing
     in
this Rule shall prevent any member from (1) selling any such
securities
     to
any person, or account managed by any person, to whom it has
provided or
     will
provide bona fide research, if the stated public offering price
for
     such
securities is paid by the purchaser; or (2) selling any such
    
securities owned by him to any person at any net price which may be

purchasers or
    
sellers of securities, or analyses and reports concerning
issuers,
    
industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio
strategy,
     and
performance of accounts; provided, however, that investment
management
     or
investment discretionary services are not bona fide research.

         
(c) A member who grants a selling concession, discount or other
    
allowance to another person shall obtain a written agreement from
that
    
person that he will comply with the provisions of this Rule, and a
member
     who
grants such selling concession, discount or other allowance to
a
    
nonmember broker or dealer in a foreign country shall also obtain
from such
    
broker or dealer a written agreement to comply, as though such
broker or
    
dealer were a member, with the provisions of Rules 2730 and 2750
and to
    
comply with Rule 2420 as that Rule applies to a nonmember
broker/dealer in
     a
foreign country.

         
(d) A member who receives an order from any person designating
another
    
broker or dealer to receive credit for the sale shall, within 30
days after
     the
end of each calendar quarter, file reports with the Association

dealers
    
designated; the identity and amount of securities for which each

securities shall keep, and maintain for a period of 24 months,
records in
     such
form and manner to show the following information: name of

which the
    
member was designated; the identity of the manager or managers of
the

other information as the Association shall deem pertinent.

              
          
2420. DEALING WITH NON-MEMBERS

         
(a) No member shall deal with any non-member broker or dealer
except

the same prices, for the same commissions or fees, and on the same
terms
     and
conditions as are by such member accorded to the general
public.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no member
shall:

a
         
member of a registered securities association and not allowed to
a
         
member of the general public;

              
(2) join with any non-member broker or dealer in any syndicate

of
         
securities or any part thereof; or

     
         
(3) sell any security to or buy any security from any
non-member
         
broker or dealer except at the same price at which at the time of
such
         
transaction such member would buy or sell such security, as the
case
         
may be, from or to a person who is a member of the general public
not
         
engaged in the investment banking or securities business.

         
(c) Transaction with foreign non-members.

         
The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Rule shall not
apply
     to
any non-member broker or dealer in a foreign country who is not
eligible
     for
membership in a registered securities association, but in any
    
transaction with any such foreign non-member broker or dealer,
where a
    
selling concession, discount, or other allowance is allowed, a
member shall
     as a
condition of such transaction secure from such foreign broker
or
    
dealer an agreement that, in making any sales to purchasers within
the
    
United States of securities acquired as a result of such
transactions, he
     will
conform to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Rule

For the purpose of this Rule, the term "non-member broker or
dealer"
    
shall include any broker or dealer who makes use of the mails or of
any
    
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any
transaction
     in,

on a
    
national securities exchange, who is not a member of any
securities
    
association, registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 15A
of the
     Act,
except a broker or dealer who deals exclusively in commercial
paper,
