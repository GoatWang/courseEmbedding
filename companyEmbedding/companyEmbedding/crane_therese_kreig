Overview

    With a sturdy toggle clamp to secure your stock to the jig, and a large frontal clamping recess for securing the jig to the bench, you'll get perfect alignment every time. Thanks to the removable drill guide and portable base, you have the option of taking the jig to large work pieces and awkward locations or slipping it in your pocket for work on the job site. The material support stop guarantees perfect repeatability time after time, and the dust collection shroud aids in chip expulsion for faster, cleaner drilling. Adjustable for 1/2" to 1-1/2" thick stock in 1/8" incremental settings.
Features:

3 tools in 1 - benchtop jig, portable contractor jig, repair jig with addition of spacer blocks to the bottom of drill guide
3-hole drill guide w/hardened steel core-adjustable for 1/2" to 1-1/2" stock thicknesses in 1/8" increments
Material support stop swings out of the way for multiple holes
Glass reinforced nylon body
Wood chip relief-one relief hole for each drill guide hole keeps chips clear for faster drilling and less burning
Large clamping recess 
Sturdy toggle clamp - easily adjusted

I am going to build a kitchen table  using 4x4 for legs and 2x4,6 for top What is the difference in the 4 and 5 jigs. Which should I buy?

BEST ANSWER: Both would work. The 4 has the clamp in the back and the 5 is in the front. So, it is really a preference/convenience thing. When you buy the kits, they do come with different accessories.

Can you add dust collection port to one without it included?

BEST ANSWER: This is a small, but very useful "hand tool," and the only "dust" generated is the thin spiral that follows the drill bit twist. One might get a small pile of shavings after a while, but barely enough to brush away once or twice.

BEST ANSWER: Tough to answer not knowing your table design. If you are referring to the number of screws per joint, I would think 4 should be sufficient.. Again, all depends on your design.

Kreg Jig
I used this on one small project so far and it works like a charm. It didn't take  long to figure it out and did a nice jib.  Obviously, one could do jobs without using this jig set, but this thing saves time and the end result is very good!  The screws in the set don't go very far, so if buying one and you have a job in mind, get additional screw for the wood you'll be using, unless you are just a couple of blocks from the store, I'm not!

K4MS
I would recommend this jig. Works great and a real time saver when building cabinets. I especially like the front clamp which made it much easier to work with some large panels for garage cabinets. Quality seems great, with a well thought out set of features such as the storage compartments and the depth gage. My first pocket hole jig so can not compare to others.

Great product design, and easy to master, even by a beginner.
It was quite an easy process to learn how to use this system. The teaching aids are well done. I wish there were a "screwdriver handle" type tool included so that you could do a final hand tightening of each screw.

Just what I was looking For
Seldom does a product work exactly as described- this one does.It has solved a host of joinery problems I have had over the years that kept me from making or doing dozens of things around the house.  Watch the Kreg videos and follow the directions, especially about clamping things tightly so that screws don't pull the pieces out of place.  The videos also show off the versatility of he system.  You can use it almost anywhere for construction or repair.It is as easy and it works as well as they say.   I wish I had discovered it a long time ago.

This is a FANTASTIC tool! My only problem was that the drill bit that came with it broke almost immediately. I had another one from my original smaller portable Kreg so it was not really an issue. I would absolutely recommend this tool to any woodworker...hobbyist or pro. A must-have!

I can't believe how easy and fast this tool is to use!  The joints produced are amazingly strong for just a couple of screws.  I've been making window casings and get them done in less than half the time then my fellow employees.  Best tool I've purchased in many years!

Love this kit!
Kreg did it again, this pocket hole kit is awesome. It's really easy to use both with the clamp base and with the portable guide.  Setting up the hole depth is super easy with easy to read markings on the parts.  Ever since I started using this jig my biscuit joiner rarely sees the light of day anymore.

After years of using a metal block with a 5/16 hole drilled at 15 degrees & using a C Clamp I was able to almost get the hole in the right place. with this Kreg Jig K4MS I am able to get it right every time in about 1/4 the time. I used it first to repair a chair and the results were a strong joint without a load of clamps. I am looking forward to my next project. No shop should be without this tool.

Excellent quality. Highly recommended. My wife and I used the pocket hole system to build our first solid wood furniture cabinet under flat screen TV. It could not be easier to use but here are some hints:1 Read the paper instructions inside the DVD packet. It's much quicker than navigating the DVD.2 Proper set-up is required or the tip of your drill will run into the base of the jig. See item 1.3 Plan on mounting this jig to something more stable as it requires multiple hands when using large work pieces.4 Use coarse thread screws for soft wood #8 x 1-1/4&quot; long for 3/4&quot; thick boards

I think I have every pocket hole clamp and accessory Kreg makes and have had a great deal of fun using them. I was excited when I first saw it on the New Yankee workshop and rushed out to get one. I have over the years built several projects with the jig and have loved every minute. However that being said there are a couple of things the new user should be aware of. 1. If you use glue on your projects be aware it not only serves to strengthen the project, In the beginning it will act as a lubricant and make getting your joints flush Difficult. 2. If your want perfect joints clamp, clamp ,clamp. The force of the screws WILL force the piece out of alignment. Beyond that get one of these and build your little heart out !

I have considered buying the Kreg pocket jig for a long time and finally deceided to order one. When I received the K4 Master System, I read the instructions, and watched the enclosed video. The first time I used it the results were outstanding. It is easy to set up and even easier to use. I've used biscuits and dowels in the past but nothing is easer or produces the results that I've achieved with the K4 right from the box. Great tool.

I have been eyeing this kit for a long time. I decided to purchase it to assist with the building of magazine rack lamp stand for Christmas gift. I used it on the face frame and it was amazing how solid it is. No gaps in the joints, it pulled everything tight. This saved a lot of time and now has me thinking that I will use it to complete more of the assemble which remains.

K4 Master Jig Kit
I have used this unit in many of my classes. It is simple and straight forward, very easy to use. I have used other pocket hole jigs and this one is far superior.

At first I was unsure as to the quality of the product and its ability to deliver. However, after using it on my project I'm sold
It performed well beyond my expectations. Good product

Extremely Satisfied
I restored an antique Library Table that belonged to my wife's great grandmother. The table is well over 100 years old. The  table top had to be replaced. Using the Kreg System enabled me to fasten the table skirt back to the new top and made it look like a professional job.After watching a demonstration of the Kreg system I knew that's what I wanted to use to join the skirt to the new top.Easy to use, storage case makes it easy to keep track of all parts and store in my workshop. Yes, I would recommend this product, well worth the money spent.

Super addition to my toolbox
I have been seeing this tool advertised and just really did not need one UNTIL my daughter-in-law wanted me to build a vanity for my granddaughter for her 4th birthday.  The K3 made short work on fastening all parts together, even the mirror frame.  I highly recommend this tool and especially for anyone who does any kind of furniture type woodworking.

Really easy
Kreg k4 jig is real easy to setup and use. I started making things right out of the box. I would like to add one of those shop made desks for it , so long pieces would be easier, but until then this is best gift my wife ever bought me.

Overview

Much like table saw rip fences, the T-square fence on Kreg's Precision Router Table keeps the fence parallel to the miter slot, making tiny adjustments simple, and allowing you to enjoy all the benefits of the miter slot, all the time. The fence also features two independent fence faces, and a shim system for jointing in 1/32'' and 1/16'' increments. The top is made from vibration- and noise-resistant MDF with a high-pressure laminate skin and is reinforced by two steel struts, which keep it from sagging. The bottom side of the phenolic insert plate is laser-etched with a template for easy mounting of your router. The plate includes three Level-Loc reducing rings and a unique ''ring wrench''—just turn to lock them in place and they automatically level themselves. The 1-13/16'' ring is compatible with standard guide bushings. All of this rests on the Kreg Multi-Purpose Shop Stand, adjustable from 29'' to 35'' in height to suit users of all sizes and tastes.Features:Self-squaring fence always travels parallel to miter slotFence includes a dust collection portFence is made from an incredibly rigid fully-enclosed aluminum extrusion1-1/16'' thick MDF top for reduced noiseTop is professionally edgebanded, and reinforced by steel struts to prevent saggingImpact resistant Easy-Slide™ laminate skin for low-friction routingLaser-engraved target pattern on the underside of the plate ensures simple, accurate router centering and mountingCombination miter/accessory slot accepts standard 3/8'' x 3/4'' miter bars and a variety of accessories such as featherboardsSteel stand is adjustable from 29'' to 35'' to suit the tastes of the userSteel stand has holes for mounting a cabinet or dust collection enclosureDurable, low-friction phenolic insert plateThree reducing rings (1'', 1-13/16'' and 2-5/8''), including one that accepts aftermarket guide bushingsFour Kreg Precision Insert Plate Levelers ensure accuracy and a smooth, catch-free sliding surfaceIndependent fence faces allow the table to double as a vertical jointerIncludes shims for offsetting fence faces by 1/32'' or 1/16'' for jointing

BEST ANSWER: The Triton TRA001 router is great for this table.  Check if the holes in the insert plate are predrilled for the Triton TRA001. Kreg will drill the base screw holes for $25  BUT they do not drill the hole for router lift crank. Go figure!!! Why does  Kreg drill the router base screw holes and not the router lift hole?

The router table is designed to be universal. The mounting plate needs to be drilled for your router. Kreg makes pre-drilled mounting plates for Porter cable, Bosch and Triton. I have a 2 hp Craftsmen and it works perfectly. I used the table today.  Be aware that  it takes a bit of care to drill the plate perfectly.

Kreg has a remote switch available for this table.  Comes with two outlets so you can plug in your dust collection system to it.  I added the Kreg switch to my table, was a true bolt on.  I had the switch installed in under 5 minutes.  All the mounting hardware was included.

Hello Gerald,All of the answers above are correct. With your PRS1045 out of the box it will have a blank insert plate that will need to be drilled to match your router base. If you do not wish to do this we at Kreg do offer a Custom Insert Plate Drilling Program (https://www.kregtool.com/tool-specs/custom-router-table-insert-plate-drilling-program-program-overview.aspx). This option is much cheaper than purchasing pre-drilled insert plates (https://www.kregtool.com/store/c35/router-table-systems/p415/precision-router-table-insert-plate--predrilled-for-triton/ or https://www.kregtool.com/store/c35/router-table-systems/p416/precision-router-table-insert-plate--predrilled-for-porter-cable-bosch/).Thank You,Josh

BEST ANSWER: You have to drill holes in the Phenolic insert plate.  Best to use a drill press. You will need  longer screws to hold the insert plate to the router. Also, before you drill the holes make sure the router is positioned that the power button is accessible. Kreg charges $30  to drill the holes and provide the longer screws. BUT, BUT, BUT they do not drill the hole for the lifting crank!!!!  If you buy the plate directly from Kreg they will predrill the router and lifting crank holes.

The Kreg tables comes with a blank insert plate that one must drill according to the router one owns.  Kreg makes a router insert plate for certain Triton models.  Mounting holes are best drilled with a drill press.  I don't own a drill press so I constructed a centering jig to ensure that my router was perfectly centered.  This is especially important if one is using a guide bushing.  Kreg has instructional material on their website.

Good Quality, Solid Work Surfaces and a few challenges
The Kreg table is sturdy, has a large, sturdy work surface but can be a challenge to set up perfectly. It took a bit of ingenuity to drill the insert plate and perfectly center the router. Even with the video on the Kreg site, I needed to create a drilling jig to perfectly center my router.  Perfect centering is needed if one uses a guide bushing. The fence does stay aligned but it takes two hands to reposition. Adjustment of nylon screws is crucial for maintaining alignment and squaring the fence.  The snap-in vacuum port works but is not robust.  It often pulls out of the fence if one uses a shop vac.  It would be preferred to have a port made of more robust material that screws in or clamps to the fence.The table comes with 3 insert rings.  I found that I needed rings that were closer in size to my bits so I purchased a ring set with more sizes. I also decided that I needed a switch so I could operate a router and vacuum.  Finally, the assembled table is sturdy and heavy.  That is great if the table is used in a stationary location.  However if you need to move the table you will need high end, lockable casters that are very pricey.

An incredible add to my shop!
As I was assembling this Router Table I could tell it was high quality, including the stand, the table top and the Precision Fence. I takes a little time to complete the assembly, but it is well worth it. I love the precise adjust-ability of the fence. It's an incredible addition to my shop and I smile everytime I use it. Well worth the money spent.

A GREAT addition to my shop!
I had been using a homemade extension to my table saw for a router.  It served me ok for several years but when I wanted to do angle cuts on my table saw I had to remove the router.  I finally bit the bullet and after a lot of research, purchased this package along with additional brake wheels.  I have never been sorry.  Although this package cost me nearly as much as my table saw it has been worth every penny.  Someday I hope to get a router lift but in the meantime it is much handier than my homemade one.  I would definitely recommend this package to the hobbyist or serious woodworker.

Bought it on sale. What a deal! Coming out of the box it looked as though it was going to be a hassle putting the thing together, but it went well with no problems. I mounted a Porter-Cable 7815 under the table and I was off and running.

Good sturdy table system but.........
I purchased this unit because i have an older Rockler branded router lift made by Mast-R-Lift. My older  lift doesn't fit the new Rockler tables, it's too big by an inch and to thick.  It does however perfectly fit the Kreg table. I love the set up, the very sturdy stand and the fence. My only complaint is that the table top is not perfectly flat. I checked it with a Veritas precision straight edge accurate to .0015" over 36" and the table sags a bit right at the lift plate. I'm kind of stuck with the top since no other will fit my lift.

9-1/4 inch width of plate makes this useless with all other lifts.
Way to keep it proprietary.  Bench Dog, Incra and Rockler inserts and lifts do not fit this table.. Also the Kreg insert is to light weight for a 3 hp router.

Crane Electrification & Conductor Systems | U-S Safety Trolley































 


 Find A Rep










Crane Electrification
Crane electrification was one of the most popular uses of the U-S Safety Trolley product suite when it was first introduced, and this remains the same today.
Span-Guard was the first of the joint-free crane conductor systems introduced decades ago, and has been powering cranes ever since. Developed first in the 1950s to meet the conditions of steel mills, the system’s patented self-sealing vinyl cover protects the conductor from harsh environments, and ensures your cranes will have continuous power no matter the conditions. The Span-Guard crane power supply is available in 250 and 520 amps.
Tri-Bar/Four-Bar utilizes this same joint-free design but with three and four bar models. Created in the 1960s, this rugged system is a time-tested mobile electrification solution that can also be molded to specific, atypical layouts that may include bends, loops or ovals as opposed to the typical straight run of power. This flexible power supply is offered in 100 and 125 amps for your crane electrification needs. No matter where or how you’d like to use your cranes – Tri-Bar/Four-Bar can supply the power.
The latest editions to the U-S Safety Trolley line–PowerGlide and TightWire–are also used for crane electrification, and are available in 90 amps. With simplistic, lightweight designs, these systems were created with easy transport, installation and maintenance in mind; creating the perfect jib crane and gantry crane power supply solution. Supplied on a portable roll, both offer three or four solid copper conductors that are joint-free and ready to install for quick and easy access to power.
All four joint-free systems in the U-S Safety Trolley product suite have become the crane power supply of choice.

Changing the Way You Think of Mobile Electrification
TightWire is a continuous joint-free electrical conductor system that ships on a roll. TightWire uses a single piece insulator containing 4 solid copper conductors. TightWire is compact and light weight which makes it fast and easy to install. Spring tension is applied from the end assemblies which keep the system strong and straight and only requires 10 feet spacing between hangers. Fewer supports translate into quicker installation time. No expansion joints required.
TightWire’s conductors are pre assembled in a one-piece PVC insulator which means no joints to cause arcing and electrical damage. The 90 amp size can be used for most crane needs.
TightWire eliminates the most common problems with jointed systems:

Number of hangers and mounting brackets cut in half
Joints every ten feet, with pins, clamps or splices
Figure 8 shaped carbon steel conductors
Bulky space requirements
Three or four separate bars to install
Oversized conductors for hoists and monorails

Fast, Easy Installation Means More Profits
The key to TightWire is an increase in labor savings. Typically, a large amount of installation time is used to weld the mounting brackets to the building. TightWire’s unique design allows hanger spacing of 10 feet, instead of the usual 5 feet, by tensioning the system from each end, using heavy springs. Thus, the “tightwire” name. The time and cost of installing mounting brackets and hangers is cut in half. In addition, TightWire speeds up installation with its one-piece design. All conductors are pre assembled in a one-piece extruded insulator. This assembly is supplied on a roll with no joints, to the exact total length needed for each project. 10-foot single bars, joint pins, screws, covers, downtime and maintenance problems are eliminated.
Features

Continuous, joint-free conductors, shipped on a roll
A single-piece insulator containing four conductors
Solid copper conductors
Super-compact and lightweight
Fast and easy to install
10 feet spacing between hangers reduces number of supports
90 amp size meets most crane needs

Applications


Light Duty Crane
Gorbel
Gorbel, a provider of overhead handling solutions and cranes, made the decision to use TightWire in the production of their work station cranes.

The TightWire trolley product was specifically designed to be used with light duty cranes and work station cranes. This means it was built to be light, compact, and accessible at a low price point. Gorbel decided TightWire would be the perfect solution to include in the production of each of their work station cranes.

Manufacturing
Priefert
Priefert, one of the largest farm, ranch and rodeo equipment manufacturers in the world, chose to use TightWire and Tri-Bar/Four-Bar in the early 2000s.

Priefert had previously been using a jointed conductor bar to power its robotic cranes, and was experiencing periodic connection issues with this system. After discovering that the U-S Safety Trolley line of products were all jointless, Priefert made the decision to replace its current conductor bar with Tri-Bar/Four-Bar, and side mount TightWire in the maintenance area of a new structure they were building. These two trolley systems have been up for the past decade, ensuring Priefert’s cranes have continuous access to power in order to build the essential equipment needed for today’s farms, ranches and rodeos.

The Indoor/Outdoor Industrial Power Supply System for Cranes and Stationary Equipment
Plant managers, engineers, crane operators, and others with extensive crane experience know that electrical joints are the most common source of crane electrification problems. Among other things, electrical joints become loose over time, overheat, expand and contract, and can cause a loss of power.
Span-Guard was the first continuous, joint-free electric conductor bar introduced. Span-Guard is uniquely designed with no electric joints in the solid copper conductor. And the flexible fully-enclosed insulated cover provides the most reliable, highest quality conductor system on the market. This jointless conductor is ideal for cranes, hoists, and moving equipment where problems and downtime cannot be tolerated.
Superior design means fewer parts to repair or replace, and minimal maintenance. The solid copper conductors and cover ship pre-assembled on a reel and come in 250 and 520 amp sizes. The spring loaded collectors come in 100, 200, 300 and 400 amp sizes. Stainless steel is optional.
Capable of running joint-free at lengths up to 2,000 feet, Span-Guard eliminates the power loss and overheating associated with the unreliable electrical joints of other heavy industrial power systems.
Our spring-loaded collectors use a carbon-graphite shoe and are more reliable and less costly to maintain than wheel based trolley systems because fewer moving parts require less maintenance. The spring loaded collectors automatically compensate for up-and-down, and side-to-side misalignments between the trolley electrification bars and the crane runway.
Unsurpassed Durability
The Span-Guard System’s heavy duty design and construction allows it to take abuses that other systems would not survive, making it the ideal choice for heavy duty, highly corrosive environments. Span-Guard systems can sustain high-wear applications, acid and corrosive fumes, moisture, and severe outdoor weather including temperatures from 20ºF to 140ºF or -30ºF to 160ºF for low temperatures.
Easy Installation and Maintenance
Span-Guard has fewer parts than other systems, allowing for faster installation up-front, and less maintenance in the future. The system is comprised of an electrical conductor such as hard drawn copper that is completely enclosed by a flexible insulating cover. Advanced manufacturing methods make it possible to ship the conductor and cover in coil form to your exact length requirements.
Features

Superior design – continuous copper conductor and self-closing cover – NO ELECTRICAL JOINTS!
Used in the harshest environments: paper mills, steel mills, galvanizing, smelters, mining and more
Highest performing crane electrification system for indoor and outdoor applications
15′ to 25′ hanger spacing (use of roof trusses for support common)
Installs faster – 50% less time than jointed conductor bar systems
Under tension – no expansion joints required
Handles large misalignment applications
Safe – no chance of accidental contact with conductors
Virtually maintenance free
Span-Guard can be cut to your specification and can accommodate all of your AC or DC crane electrification needs
Copper conduct and cover ships pre-assembled on a reel
Unsurpassed reliability is the primary reason Span-Guard Electrification has been on the market for more than

Applications


Paper Mill
International Paper
International Paper implemented the joint-free Span-Guard conductor bar system in the 1980s to power its paper machines.

In the paper mill industry, a paper machine being down for just one hour equates to approximately $100,000 lost in productivity. When it comes to powering this essential equipment, reliability is key. A jointed conductor bar system can mean a glitch in the power, production stopping, and having to call in maintenance to fix the problem. This is exactly why International Paper chose to rely on Span-Guard - the time-tested, continuous copper conductor bar - as its mobile power solution.

Steel Mill
US Steel, Nucor
US Steel selected U-S Safety Trolley's Span-Guard to power up its equipment due to the systems dependability in harsh environments.

The process of manufacturing steel requires intense temperatures and an abundance of chemicals. These type of conditions can wreak havoc on a jointed conductor bar- meaning lots of maintenance issues to deal with and a loss in productivity due to power being down. US Steel took notice of the Span-Guard system due to its solid copper, joint-free design with a protective vinyl cover; creating the perfect combination of reliability and safety.

Dam
Conowingo Dam - Route 1 in Maryland
Span-Guard was chosen to provide a 2700 foot long stretch of joint-free electric conductor bar across the center of the Conowingo Dam, a large hydroelectric dam located along Route 1 in Maryland.

The Conowingo Dam supports a 9,000 acre reservoir that covers the original town of Conowingo. The dam has 53 flood control gates, all of which are operated by three overhead cranes. In order to power these cranes, an extremely long stretch of electric conductor bar was needed. Span-Guard is capable of running joint-free at long lengths, and has a self-sealing vinyl cover to guarantee protection through any weather condition- making it the ideal crane electrification solution for the job.

A Low Maintenance and Hassle-Free Crane Electrification & Trolley System
Tri-Bar/Four-Bar continuous electrical conductor bar systems have been a long-time favorite among our customers. The joint-free construction, easy installation and maintenance, and custom fabrications make the Tri-Bar/Four-Bar the sensible choice in electric trolley bar systems.
Tri-Bar/Four-Bar solid copper conductors come in 100 and 125 amps with collectors in 35, 70, and 125 amps; and power pickups in 15, 30, 40 and 50 amps.
When U-S Safety Trolley set out to design an electric trolley system, we kept two things in mind. First – most problems with mobile electrification arise at the conductor joints. Second – on trolley systems those problems, and even extended routine maintenance, create downtime and a loss of profit. We eliminated the conductor joints, simplified installation and created the Tri-Bar/Four-Bar electric trolley product lines. On our Tri-Bar/ Four-Bar trolley systems, installation and maintenance are simple and straightforward, and the continuous copper conductor reduces hang-ups and derailments.
Tri-Bar/Four-Bar are perfect for:

Crane electrification
Assembly lines
Cutting tables and sewing lines in the garment industry
Hanger doors
Monorails

Tri-Bar/Four-Bar provides a variety of electric power system design solutions for mobile electrification. The trolley systems can extend for hundreds of feet using continuous copper conductors, which are the ideal medium for communication and control signals for cranes and hoists. Our Tri-Bar/Four-Bar trolley systems can be factory shaped to your specifications into loops, ovals, circles, and multi-curved monorail tracks, and modified with switches and disengagable trolleys. These custom systems are shipped for easy assembly and installations.
Joint-Free Design
The feature of continuous, joint-free, electrical conductors for the entire length of the run eliminates the weakest part of any electrical system — the joints. One-piece copper conductors are cut to each job requirement and shipped in a coil; providing a highly reliable, maintenance-free application.
Features
Tri-Bar/Four-Bar is the solution to these problems:

Downtime due to arcing
Loose joints
Pitted steel bars
Expansion
Misalignment
Curves, oval systems, 360 degree circles, and unique applications are our specialty

Factory Assembly
Whirlpool
Whirlpool, along with so many others in the home appliance industry, chose the Tri-Bar/Four-Bar electric conductor system to supply power to its factory assembly lines.

The process of creating home appliances involves an extensive assembly line and a great deal of testing. However, in order to effectively complete the burn-in and hipot testing of appliances-such as refrigerators or microwaves- it’s necessary to supply power to these devices while they are on the conveyer belt traveling down the assembly line. It’s also essential that the power doesn’t go down, because downtime equals a delay in production and a decrease in profits. 

Whirlpool chose the Tri-Bar/Four-Bar system due to its proven reliability and ability to bend and conform to fit factory-specific requirements.

Applications


Hangar doors
American Airlines
American Airlines made the decision to depend on a 1,100 foot long PowerGlide system to supply power to its large hangar doors that house its aircrafts.

Before the introduction of PowerGlide, airline hangar doors were predominantly run with festoon systems. However, the everyday wear and tear on this type of system caused a lot of maintenance issues and negatively affected its reliability. Before PowerGlide, American Airlines had previously been ahead of the game by using another brand of conductor bar. But, they were experiencing maintenance and power disconnection issues- or issues that are common with jointed bar systems.

PowerGlide's lightweight and jointless, low maintenance design makes it the perfect fit for hangar doors. American Airlines, along with many other airlines including United, US Airways, and the structure that houses Air Force One chose PowerGlide to power its hangar doors because it’s easy to install, has no joints - meaning less maintenance - and also can come with a protective rubber housing.
