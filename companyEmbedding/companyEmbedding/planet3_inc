BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Edtech Business Planet3 Raises Extra $3 Million to Pilot STEAM Games in Nevada SchoolsBy Tony Wan     Jun  1, 2016 Image Credit: Planet3TweetShareEmailAside from throwing them, I never thought much of rocks, or their studies. It wasn’t until I approached Svartifoss, and gazed in awe at the thunderous, pristine Icelandic water roaring down haunting, hexagonal basalt columns, that I learned to care (and climb) rocks.
	It shouldn’t take a trip to Iceland to get kids interested in geology, or any sciences, reckons Tim Kelly, CEO of Planet3, which is developing game-based simulations through which students can learn and explore STEAM subjects. Already he’s raised $10 million in a Series A round announced last September. Now he’s looking for more. Today, Planet3 shared it has secured another $3 million in the “first phase of our Series B funding,” Kelly tells EdSurge in an interview. He hopes to raise as much as $15 million for this next round.
	The new money comes from Switch, a Nevada-based builder of massive data centers around the world, and which led the previous funding round. Kelly, along with his co-founders Dr. Albert Lin and Vijay Lakshman, also invested from their own pockets to launch the company.One mission will have students chasing twisters
	Kelly has brought nature’s wonders to the masses before. During his 30 years at National Geographic he helped the print publication evolve into a media powerhouse through efforts such as the creation of National Geographic Channel and a film division that won an Academy Award for “March of the Penguins.”
	In August 2014, Kelly co-founded his current venture to “put adventure, exploration and storytelling into education and get kids amped about the most exciting subjects in the planet.” He’s assembled a team of 35 that includes game designers, engineers, former media executives, educators. Together, they hope to combine “game design and rich media with storytelling and data sets to bring science to life,” he adds.
	Schoolchildren in Nevada—where Switch is based—will be the first brave explorers of what Planet3 has to offer. This fall, sixth- and seventh-grade students in roughly 25 schools across six districts will get a taste of the company’s interactive activities in earth and physical sciences. Up to half of science class time may be devoted to using Planet3, says Kelly McGrath, the company’s Chief Learning Officer. At least eight online and in-person professional development training sessions have been planned to help teachers use the tool.
	These pioneering teachers and students  will “help us refine, iterate and provide us with rich classroom experience of the platform,” Kelly says. “We will be spending the whole year investing in building the platform and the curriculum through this experience.”

	Rather than talk and read about the weather, students will, for instance, play the role of a storm chaser to track and predict the path of a tornado. Another mission will take students deep into an Icelandic volcano to learn about earthquakes, tectonic plates and other elements unique to the island’s natural environment.
	Integrated into each of these simulations, says Pat Skorkowsky, Superintendent of Clark County School District in Nevada, are vocabulary, math and critical thinking exercises that offer “a more integrated, interdisciplinary approach” to sciences. The content is also designed to align with the Next Generation Science Standards, which so far have been adopted by 16 states.
	The pilot will run for the 2016-2017 school year, after which the company plans to have a polished product it can sell as a subscription service.CommentsEdtech Business Planet3 Raises Extra $3 Million to Pilot STEAM Games in Nevada SchoolsBy Tony Wan     Jun  1, 2016 Image Credit: Planet3TweetShareEmailAside from throwing them, I never thought much of rocks, or their studies.
