Vancouver, B.C. - Organto Foods Inc. (TSX-V: OGO, OTC: OGOFF) ("Organto") is pleased to announce that it has reached an agreement with Amfri Farms Limited ("Amfri") a 600 hectare (1500 acre) Demeter Biodynamic® farm based in Uganda.  As per the terms of the agreement, Amfri will grow Organic and Demeter certified organic products under the Organto brand to be distributed to Organto growing customer base throughout Europe.  The Demeter certification denotes a farm using a biodynamic methodology treats soil fertility, plant life and livestock as ecologically interrelated tasks and is globally recognized as one of the most complete organic certifications. 
 
Organto and Amfri will commence a small-scale commercial program in the first quarter of 2017 growing organic Haricot Verts (French Green Beans), Sugar Snaps and Snow Peas. The agreement calls for a significant expansion of production over the coming years.  In addition to its flagship Demeter certified Kyampisi plantation, Amfri is also in the process of organically certifying a further 400 hectares of land.  All products will carry the Organto label and will be distributed by Organto Europe B.V.  The products will carry the Demeter or organic certifications as well as have certifications for Global GAP, BRC and BRIC, as appropriate. 
 
With the addition of the Amfri operation, Organto has now strengthened its ability to provide year-round production of organic French Green Beans, Sugar Snaps and Snow Peas from Argentina, Guatemala and Uganda.  In addition, Organto now has a secondary supply from a well-respected producer in an area known for organic production. The Demeter designation is one of the highest standards in the organic industry incorporating a Biodynamic® agricultural process for regeneration of the land. A product with the Biodynamic® or Demeter designation tends to receive a significant premium to conventional products in the supermarket aisle. Consumers and retailers alike are continuing to demand organically certified and socially conscious products from producers and the addition of the Uganda operation positions Organto as a leading provider of specialty organically certified products.  
 
About Amfri Farms Limited(www.african-organic.com)
 
Amfri's flagship plantation, Kyampisi was established in 1930 and has been growing IMO Certified Organic products from the 600 hectare farm over the past 18 years.  In 2008, it obtained the coveted Demeter farm designation and has looked to expand its farming operations over the past few years.  The Company was the first to obtain the Demeter certification in Uganda and produces a variety of products for sale into Europe, North American and the Middle East.
 
About Organto
 
Organto is a vertically integrated, leading provider of fresh-cut, branded organic produce from company-owned organic farms and greenhouses located in Latin America and now Africa.  Organto works closely with small local farmers to assist in the transition from conventional to organic farming by providing them with technical assistance, seeds, fertilizer and other inputs.  Organto's strategy is to replicate its social and business model throughout Latin America and other regions thereby increasing production of specialty organic produce to satisfy consumer demand in Europe and North America, while at the same time benefiting local farmers and agricultural growing groups by assisting them to increase profitability.
 
About Demeter/Biodynamic
 
Demeter remains the oldest ecological certification organization in the world.  Its farm standard has always been a regenerative agriculture standard, and Biodynamic farms have been sequestering carbon for almost 100 years.  The first Demeter chapter was formed in Germany following Dr. Rudolf Steiner's "Agricultural Course".  In 1924, Steiner (noted scientist, philosopher, and founder of the Waldorf School) held a series of eight lectures for a group of European farmers, who had approached him because they were observing a rapid decline in seed fertility, crop vitality and animal health on their farms.  In 1927, following Steiner's lectures, a co-operative was formed to market Biodynamic produce, and in 1928 the Demeter symbol and first Standard was introduced to ensure that the farming methods were uniformly followed and monitored. By 1931, there were approximately 1,000 Biodynamic farms.  In 1985 Demeter was formed in the US as a non-profit, seventeen years before the USDA established the National Organic Program (NOP).   Demeter International is the first, and remains, the only ecological association consisting of a network of individual certification organizations in 45 countries around the world.
 
Demeter is the owner of the trademark terms "Biodynamic®" and "Demeter®".  These trademarks are held as certification marks, which provide an assurance to consumers that the product has been certified to a uniform standard.  Demeter holds these marks, and is therefore solely responsible for ensuring their adherence, to protect the integrity of Biodynamic agriculture and the products that result, both for consumers and for farmers.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Oil struggles for direction, but holds ground near 2-month high
              
              Oil prices struggle for direction Thursday, but hold ground near their highest level in two months as traders weighed support from four weeks of falling U.S. crude supplies against pressure from concerns over rising production.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar stabilizes after falling to 13-month low
              
              A widely watched U.S. dollar gauge stabilized on Thursday, but still languished at a 13-month low, struggling to shake off the dovish interpretation among investors of the Federal Reserve’s policy statement.

Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's like we got it from Central Casting: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience. Cue the credits.



Meat & Poultry
If you’re looking for “natural meat,” we’re looking out for you, because that term only means no additives in the finished product. We go further with great-tasting meat from animals raised with no antibiotics, ever, and no added hormones*. Plus, our farmer and rancher partners follow strict standards for farm-animal welfare. And we’ve got you covered when it comes to local, grass-fed and organic, too.



Seafood
Our Seafood Department is the top reason many shoppers give for coming to our stores. Not only will you find a wide selection of fresh and frozen, high-quality seafood, we source only from sustainable fisheries and responsible farms. You can shop with confidence, and our fishmongers are ready with a smile.

Add Share Button To Marquee Box:  Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's the first thing you see when you come into one of our stores: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience.
The quality of produce at our stores is simply second to none. Our produce buyers, based in all regions of the country, maintain relationships with our local growers and our field inspectors are on the road 52 weeks a year seeking out the best of the best.
Organic produce is a mainstay for us. Early on, we committed to offering as much organic produce as available because we believe organic farming supports a healthy environment. Fresh fruits and vegetables grown without the use of long-lasting chemical pesticides and fertilizers will always have a prominent place on our shelves.
We feature local produce in season. While the definition of local varies by region of the country, it generally means one day’s drive away or less, and it's usually much less. Ask a produce team member where your store’s local produce comes from and when your favorite items will be in season.
We know that you like to know where your food comes from, so we display the origin of every piece of produce we sell. To meet customer demand, we do our best to offer the highestquality fruits and vegetables year-round, so we use our experience and relationships with growers from around the world to obtain the best of what's "in season" in other parts of the world.
Devotion to quality and service is a daily mantra in every one of our produce departments. That's why you can find just about anything you want there, from the humble to the exotic, from bananas to Buddha's hand (in season, of course!). Come in and explore. You're bound to find something delicious.

The NEW FoodSaver® FM5460 Food Preservation System keeps food fresh up to 5X longer (compared to ordinary storage methods) and saves up to $2700 per year (based on buying in bulk, buying on sale and preventing waste).  Plus it’s easier to use by taking the time and guesswork out of bag making and sealing, and provides the 2-in-1 versatility for freezer, fridge and pantry storage. 
 
The FM5460 System incorporates NEW features like the Express Bag Maker that reduces vacuum sealing steps by 50%* because it pre-seals the bottom end of your next bag each time. The Vacuum View Window allows you to see where you seal, giving you better control during vacuum sealing allowing you to reduce the roll waste up to 30 percent*.  The Lower Seal and Cut Bar design allows you to use your countertop as your work space, providing ease and convenience for making custom-sized, ready-to-use bags automatically and the easy-access Open Roll Storage keeps track of bag inventory, so you always know when you're running low!
 
The FM5460 System also combines the 2-in-1 functionality that is unique to the FoodSaver® brand. It combines a powerful upright vacuum sealing system to vacuum seal bags for long-term storage in your freezer, with an integrated retractable handheld sealer to vacuum zipper bags and containers that keep refrigerated foods and pantry items fresh and delicious.
*Compared to previous FoodSaver® Food Preservation Systems

Can't do without Foodsaver
Bought my first Foodsaver 10 years ago. Just got my new Foodsaver. Absolutely can't do without it. There have been many improvements over the years. Love the new model. I buy groceries a month at the time and my Foodsaver protects the meats from freezer burn. Saving lots of money by buying in bulk.

Excellent vacuum & sealing!
Excellent vaccum & sealing!
I belive we as humans are taking a jump into understanding how healthy organisms live and evolve into or body cells, and/or other living things.
Nutrition is at it's best when our food is fresh, or kept preserved.
A vacuum and seal is a natural way of preserving organisms/food.

SUPPOSED TO SUCK BUT DOESN'T
Our old unit worked pretty well and saved us $$$ and less food being thrown away. Bought this new FM5460 2 in 1 unit and it worked the first day we had it. A month later we were using it again and it did everything but vac! We tried to use new bags and preformed bags but it wouldn't even come close to vac out all the air... I was lucky and returned the new unit for a full refund but even better I had kept my old one and it works fine!!!

UGH
I bought this almost 2 yrs ago thinking it would speed up our deer meat processing & other bulk food purchase processing WRONG!!!! It takes two (2) hands to get the vaccum/sealer to work which as some know doesn't work cuz sometimes takes 1 hand to lict up enough to level out enough to seal.
REALLY SORRY I SPENT THE MONEY TO REPLACE MY OLDER Food saver for a "NEWER" UPGRADER" version! WHAT A MISTAKE!! If you don't want to repackage bulck foods go for it but make sure you have 4 hands to work it , it takes 2 hands to work the vaccum seal & 2 hands to keep it even to get it to stay level. I wouldn't recommend this series to anyone. The attached vacuum sealer doesn't work that great either. Had the separate vacuum bag sealer & really. It gave up after about 6 months of use.

OUT
IN THE OPEN

Open Roll Storage takes Vacuum Seal Rolls out from the inside so you'll see how much of the roll is left.
This helps to know when you're running low and when it needs replacing.
Having visibility to the roll is especially helpful while you're sealing bulk purchases and prep-ahead meals that require multiple bags to be made;
you won't run out in the middle of sealing!

THE SEAL



Here's where you won't have to wonder if you are placing bags in the correct position for sealing.
The Vacuum View Window enables you to see where you seal for optimal control and reduces over 30% of roll waste†.
Plus, its ergonomic sealing angle also helps to comfortably lift bags into the vacuum chamber for sealing.
With dual touch activation, you can start the automatic vacuuming and sealing process to get an air-tight seal.
