About Revance
Nestled in California’s legendary Silicon Valley, the epicenter of life-changing technology and healthcare innovation, Revance stands poised to enter, if not redefine, the neurotoxin aesthetic and therapeutic product categories.











Our Trajectory to Commercial Success
Revance is more than a biotechnology company taking an innovative approach to neurotoxin delivery. We are the integrated sum of our many strengths.
Deep knowledge of drug development, scientific acumen, and prior commercialization experience will enable our team of experts to bring to market a focused portfolio of product candidates that achieve multiple strategic objectives.
Our trajectory to commercial success begins with the development and delivery of our next-generation neurotoxin, daxibotulinumtoxinA, Revance’s highly purified botulinum toxin type A.
Proof of Concept
We like to dream and think big. Our organization owns aspirations of becoming a global leader in both aesthetic medicine and underserved therapeutic specialties such as dermatology, neurology, musculoskeletal disorders, urology and ophthalmology.

Currently, Revance is advancing investigational product candidate RT002.


Currently, Revance is advancing investigational product candidate RT002 injectable. RT002 has the potential to expand practitioner and patient utilization, with the opportunity to capture, retain and grow significant market share. In anticipation of entering the $3.4 billion neurotoxin market, Revance’s potential long-acting injectable neurotoxin is being lauded as a possible game-changer by industry insiders.
While our first indication will likely be in aesthetic medicine to treat glabellar (frown) lines, we plan to follow with therapeutic options that deliver lasting results, irrespective of use area. Our ultimate mission is to improve the current state of patient care and enhance the overall patient experience. We know it can be done and we intend to prove it.

Read More >>
Focused Clinical Program
In clinical trials with investigational product candidate (RT002), daxibotulinumtoxinA has shown potential of becoming the first long-lasting injectable formulation of botulinum toxin type A. The anticipated approval of RT002 injectable would represent the first major innovation to hit the neurotoxin market in 30 years.

A well-defined regulatory path to approval puts Revance on track...


A well-defined regulatory path to approval puts Revance on track to pursue multiple indications and conceivably transform both the anti-aging market and neurotoxin treatment categories. The company’s initial aesthetic and therapeutic product portfolio should prove attractive to a diverse group of medical specialists and patients in need.

Read More >>

Remarkable Science Changes Everything
Combining TransMTS peptide companion technology with active drug macromolecules such as daxibotulinumtoxinA may help address currently unfulfilled needs in aesthetic medicine and various therapeutic categories. Employing TransMTS may ensure overall formulation performance of the RT002 injectable where the focus is on delivering the first potentially long-acting neurotoxin. With novel as well as multiple indication areas in clinical development, the company’s DaxibotulinumtoxinA compound is often referred to as “A pipeline within a product.”

Revance’s peptide companion technology, TransMTS®, is a proprietary excipient that can be formulated with various macromolecules such as daxibotulinumtoxinA.


Envisioning Future Opportunities
Revance is intensely focused on the advancement of remarkable science that can improve the way drugs perform today and in the future.

It’s no secret that Revance maintains grand ambitions of developing and commercializing the RT001 topical daxibotulinumtoxinA product candidate in hope of becoming the first-ever, needle-free topical botulinum toxin product. As we re-enter preclinical development, our initial plan is to further characterize RT001. In time, we will investigate the potential for topical application across areas of greatest need, and where an innovation of this magnitude would provide meaningful advantages over injectable administration.
Beyond daxibotulinumtoxinA, Revance believes a variety of active compounds and other macromolecules are potentially suitable for use with the company’s patented TransMTS peptide companion technology. Additional applications for TransMTS potentially range from over-the-counter beauty products to prescription drugs used daily to treat chronic diseases.
Fueled by innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, our vision is to enhance the standard of care for patients around the world. By continuously pursuing product improvements and delivering next-generation therapies, we believe we can transcend today’s possibilities.

C-Suite Perspective









Abhay Joshi, Ph.D.Chief Operating Officer

Shattering Age-Old Barriers
I joined Revance with one goal in mind — to deliver on the tremendous promise held by TransMTS®, our proprietary peptide companion technology. Yet, for me, it is never just about science alone. Rather, it is about translating science and technology into remarkable benefits appreciated by patients and physicians around the globe, and it is about product differentiation in the market place. It’s about elevating the state of patient care. These are no small feats, yet I believe these to be achievable improvements worthy of our team’s collective ambition and unwavering commitment.
Today at Revance, our team is poised on the threshold of achieving a corporate vision that began over a decade ago. That vision is to deliver a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of neuromodulator therapy. By formulating the company’s highly purified botulinum toxin with TransMTS® peptide technology, we advance ever closer to realizing the previously unthinkable — the first long-lasting neurotoxin treatment, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (RT002). Far more than an incremental innovation, this unique combination of toxin and TransMTS® creates newfound value in both aesthetic medicine and therapeutic specialties.
In clinical science, as only the experienced know, plans are laid for success while anticipating and preparing for challenges. Revance’s daxibotulinumtoxinA compound and robust clinical program have captured the attention of interested investors and physicians, established competitors notwithstanding. It is with complete confidence that I report to you that our therapeutic and aesthetic clinical programs are proceeding as planned. Furthermore, I am delighted to announce the addition of Revance’s newest Phase 2 clinical trial in plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is an extremely painful and debilitating musculoskeletal condition estimated to effect nearly 10% of people at some point during their life. With RT002 injectable, Revance plans to pursue this highly novel therapeutic indication — an important first in the category.
As COO, my passion and my focus revolve around leading team operations, cultivating our expert talent, and assuring executional excellence every step of the way. Whether sourcing the purest ingredients needed to manufacture our next-generation neurotoxin, ensuring our clinical trials are delivered on schedule, or scaling our organization for product commercialization, our team is ready for the next steps on the daxibotulinumtoxinA development trajectory. As a team, we will see it through.
It is a truly exciting time in the history of this organization, and there is virtually nothing to hold us back from realizing product enhancements eagerly awaited by patients and physicians. Innovation in our lab will only be surpassed by a true breakthrough in the clinic. Here at Revance, consistent performance and sound execution are the means to a remarkable end result. For us, shattering age-old barriers is the new reality.

Fast Facts







TransMTS®
Fact: Revance’s patented TransMTS® excipient is a unique peptide companion technology that may be used for injectable as well as topical drug products of various macromolecules and drug compounds, such as daxibotulinumtoxinA, our highly purified botulinum toxin type A.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (RT002)
Fact: RT002 INJECTABLE: Revance’s RT002 investigational product candidate is an injectable, long-acting form of daxibotulinumtoxinA. Based on clinical studies (BELMONT), RT002 holds the potential of longer duration of effect at the target muscle.
Fact: Revance is moving forward with an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission for the Phase 3 clinical program for RT002 in glabellar lines and other supportive studies required for Biologics License Application (BLA) filing. We expect to initiate Phase 3 clinical trials before the end of 2016.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical Gel (RT001)
Fact: Revance’s RT001 early development product candidate is a topical gel formulation of daxibotulinumtoxinA, administered by physicians in a proprietary single-use apparatus.
Fact: RT001 topical gel is designed to eliminate the use of needles, making this a non-invasive procedure that would help avoid pain and bruising associated with injections.
Revance
Fact: Revance manufactures daxibotulinumtoxinA, a highly purified botulinum toxin type A molecule that uses no animal-derived components or human albumin in its production.
Fact: Revance employs in-house, state-of-the-art manufacturing and analytics capabilities, and holds 174 issued patents in the US, EU, Latin America and Asia, as of September, 2016.
Fact: Revance is well-funded to aggressively support its Phase 3 development programs and plans to commercialize RT002 injectable within a few short years.
Market Potential
Fact: Although consumers primarily equate botulinum toxin with anti-aging and wrinkle reduction, the therapeutic uses of botulinum toxin represent the larger slice of the estimated $3.4 billion* global neurotoxin market.
