The Machine Learning Company®
Skytree’s mission is to elevate state-of-the-art research knowledge from the lab to practical application on an enterprise level. 
Since its launch, Skytree has been disrupting the advanced analytics market with a machine learning platform that gives organizations the power to discover deep analytic insights, predict future trends, make recommendations and reveal untapped markets and customers.
Backed by investments from US Venture Partners, Javelin Venture Partners, Samsung, UPS and In-Q-Tel, Skytree remains at the forefront of enterprise-grade machine learning with the only general purpose platform on the market, built for the highest accuracy, speed and scalability.
The Skytree name is both a reminder of where we started – implementing advanced analytics and advanced data structures on large-scale astronomical data – and an embodiment of our mission. In many mythologies, it is the cosmic tree of knowledge that lifts humanity up and helps us to realize our potential.

   Product Information    Author(s)   Tori Berquist, E. P. Donahue, Patrice Geille, Ira Lee Gossett, Dan Hembree, Val Kelson, J. C. Lambert, David Moskowitz, Dan Prentice, Douglas Toth, David A. Ullery, and Justin T. Williams     Artist(s)   Cover art, Jeff Freels; cover layout, design, and logo by M. E. Volmar and Simon Lee Tranter; interior art, Darrenn E. Canton, Alexander Cook, E. P. Donahue, James Fallows, Jeff Freels, J. C. Lambert, Simon Lee Tranter, David A. Ullery, and Joshua E. Ulle     Rule System(s)   Tunnels & Trolls     Pages   74     File Size:   8.63 MB     Format   Original electronic        Scanned image   These products were created by scanning an original printed edition. Most older books are in scanned image format because original digital layout files never existed or were no longer available from the publisher.

For PDF download editions, each page has been run through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to attempt to decipher the printed text. The result of this OCR process is placed invisibly behind the picture of each scanned page, to allow for text searching. However, any text in a given book set on a graphical background or in handwritten fonts would most likely not be picked up by the OCR software, and is therefore not searchable. Also, a few larger books may be resampled to fit into the system, and may not have this searchable text background.

For printed books, we have performed high-resolution scans of an original hardcopy of the book. We essentially digitally re-master the book. Unfortunately, the resulting quality of these books is not as high. It's the problem of making a copy of a copy. The text is fine for reading, but illustration work starts to run dark, pixellating and/or losing shades of grey. Moiré patterns may develop in photos. We mark clearly which print titles come from scanned image books so that you can make an informed purchase decision about the quality of what you will receive.      Original electronic format   These ebooks were created from the original electronic layout files, and therefore are fully text searchable. Also, their file size tends to be smaller than scanned image books. Most newer books are in the original electronic format. Both download and print editions of such books should be high quality.          File Last Updated:   March 19, 2013       This title was added to our catalog on March 19, 2013.
