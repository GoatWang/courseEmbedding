non-affiliates of the Securitizer during the Reporting Period.
  


1 
Securitizer has listed the entity that sold the loan to it as the originator. This is the entity that made the relevant representations and has the corresponding repurchase obligation. Securitizer re-underwrote each
loan purchased by it as if the entity selling the loan to it had originated the loan. In some cases the entity selling a loan to Securitizer may not have been the originator of the loan. Securitizer has no ability to determine the identity of all of
the originators without unreasonable effort and expense because in many cases the contract files delivered by the seller do not contain that information. To the extent the originator is not the seller, Securitizer has no recourse against that entity
and has not relied in any respect on that entity’s underwriting of the loan. 


SIGNATURES 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the reporting entity has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
