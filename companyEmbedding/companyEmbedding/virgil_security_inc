MACH37 Announces New Funding for Virgil Security and CyphAngel Investors CIT, Goel Fund, and NextGen Angels Invest in Two Innovative Startups September 2, 2015 (HERNDON, Va.) – The MACH37™ Cyber Accelerator announced today that two of its Fall 2014 program graduates, Virgil Security, Inc., and Cyph, have received $1,025,000 in combined seed funding from angel investors. The new funding will allow both startups to continue developing their core cybersecurity technologies while expanding their go-to-market strategies and staff.
“MACH37’s mission is to help entrepreneurs with great ideas transform those concepts into successful companies that address real needs in the security market,” said Rick Gordon, Managing Partner of MACH37™. “We’re thrilled to see MACH37 companies like Virgil Security and Cyph get funded by angel investors who realize the value these companies bring to market with their disruptive security solutions.”
Based in Manassas, VA, Virgil Security, Inc. today announced it has closed $525,000 in seed round funding led by angel investors NextGen Angels, Inner Loop Capital, and Panther Angels. Virgil was co-founded by CEO Michael W. Wellman and CTO Dmitry Dain who are alumni of the Fall 2014 cohort of the MACH37 program. Virgil provides easy-to-deploy and easy-to-use cryptographic software libraries combined with a cloud-based public key management service for developers and end-users.

Cyph is an extremely secure, easy-to-use messaging solution for both consumers and enterprises, offering a broad feature set that includes file transfers, voice/video calling, and post-quantum end-to-end encryption. It's simple for businesses to integrate with their own products through the Cyph API and/or deploy internally — for which the Cyph team is currently seeking pilot customers. More information can be found at https://www.cyph.com, and you can follow @cyph on Twitter for updates.
 “Going through the MACH37 program not only gave our team a solid foundation for building our business and product, but it also helped pave the way to announcing this seed round of funding today,” said Cyph CEO Ryan Lester. “In just one short year, we’ve accomplished a lot, and we’re looking forward to disrupting the secure communication market.”
“The MACH37 team and mentor network worked tirelessly through their rigorous program which has led to many positive developments this past year,” said Virgil Security CTO Dmitry Dain. “We encourage other cybersecurity entrepreneurs to apply to the MACH37 program. There’s simply no other program out there that offers this kind of learning while paving the way for future success in the cybersecurity market.”

8. GENERAL
8.1 Changes. These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify
    you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any), and/or by prominently posting
    notice of the changes on our Site. You are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address. In
    the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of
    delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless
    constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. Any changes to these Terms will be effective
    upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or
    thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site. These changes will be
    effective immediately for new users of our Site. Continued use of our Site following notice of such changes shall
    indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
    
    8.2 Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company
    and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. 
    (a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other
    equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by
    the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on
    an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration
    proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any
    subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all
    authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms. 
    (b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must
    first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or
    dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 9296 Sumner Lake BLVD, Manassas,
    Virginia 20110. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute
    informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is
    received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may
    not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to
    which either party is entitled. 
    (c) Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an
    established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this
    section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The
    rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of
    initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA
    Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by
    calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or
    disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be
    resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or
    disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right
    to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of
    your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you
    reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of
    any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
    jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company
    made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.
    Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and
    shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. 
    (d) Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the
    arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner
    shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance
    by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties. 
    (e) Time Limits. If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded
    within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed
    under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim. 
    (f) Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if
    any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any
    other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
    claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or
    relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a
    written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
    based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an
    individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon
    you and the Company. 
    (g) Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE
    A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
    arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and
    less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any
    litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an
    arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the
    dispute be resolved by a judge. 
    (h) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
    MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE
    CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
    
    (i) Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the
    arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality
    unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any
    information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable
    relief. 
    (j) Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or
    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect
    and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 
    (k) Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived
    by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this
    Arbitration Agreement. 
    (l) Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with
    Company. 
    (m) Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in
    small claims court. 
    (n) Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief
    before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim
    measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement. 
    (o) Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the
    Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark
    or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement. 
    (p) Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court,
    the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Prince William County,
    Virginia, for such purpose 
    8.3 Export. The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations
    in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data
    acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or
    regulations. 
    8.4 Disclosures. Company is located at the address in Section 8.8. If you are a California resident, you may report
    complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of
    Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800)
    952-5210. 
    8.5 Electronic Communications. The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the
    Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via email. For
    contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree
    that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to
    you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
