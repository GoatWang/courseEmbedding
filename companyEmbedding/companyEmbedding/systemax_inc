                                    27-inch, 2017


The already impressive 27-inch 5K iMac gets some welcome spec upgrades for 2017, but rival Windows machines have closed the gap.

Legal disputes[edit]
On September 17, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged a former director of Systemax Inc for fraudulently reaping hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed compensation between January 2006 to December 2010. The SEC alleged that Gilbert Fiorentino, who in addition to serving on the board was the former chief executive of Systemax’s Technology Products Group in Miami, "obtained more than $400,000 in extra compensation directly from firms that conducted business with Systemax." The SEC also alleged Fiorentino of stealing "several hundred thousand dollars worth of company merchandise that was used to market Systemax’s products."

Legal disputes[edit]
On September 17, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged a former director of Systemax Inc for fraudulently reaping hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed compensation between January 2006 to December 2010. The SEC alleged that Gilbert Fiorentino, who in addition to serving on the board was the former chief executive of Systemax’s Technology Products Group in Miami, "obtained more than $400,000 in extra compensation directly from firms that conducted business with Systemax." The SEC also alleged Fiorentino of stealing "several hundred thousand dollars worth of company merchandise that was used to market Systemax’s products." Fiorentino failed to disclose his extra compensation and perks to Systemax or its auditors, so that the amounts reported to shareholders were understated.[17]
In April 2011, Systemax placed Fiorentino on administrative leave. On May 9, 2011, Fiorentino agreed to resign from all of his positions with Systemax, surrender stock and stock options valued at approximately $9.1 million, and repay his 2010 annual bonus of $480,000. With Fiorentino's departure, Robert Leeds, Systemax's founding CEO of the technology division, took over as CEO of Systemax's technology products group.[17][18]
Fiorentino agreed to settle the SEC charges by paying a $65,000 fine and consenting to a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of any publicly held company.[17]
On December 3, 2014, Gilbert and Carl Fiorentino pleaded guilty for their participation in a bribery scheme, after it was found that between during his employment, Carl had received over $7 million in kickbacks from suppliers he had entered into agreements with Systemax, and obscured his participation in these agreements to Systemax. Gilbert was also charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and impeding the operation of the IRS.[19][20]
Restatement[edit]
On February 21, 2005, the company restated financial results for each of the first three quarters of 2004 and the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, following the discovery of certain inventory accounting errors at the company's British unit.[21] On May 11, 2005, the company restated its results for the year 2004, following the discovery of errors in accounting for inventory at its Tiger Direct Inc. unit, an online retailer.[22]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

On September 17, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged a former director of Systemax Inc for fraudulently reaping hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed compensation between January 2006 to December 2010. The SEC alleged that Gilbert Fiorentino, who in addition to serving on the board was the former chief executive of Systemax’s Technology Products Group in Miami, "obtained more than $400,000 in extra compensation directly from firms that conducted business with Systemax." The SEC also alleged Fiorentino of stealing "several hundred thousand dollars worth of company merchandise that was used to market Systemax’s products." Fiorentino failed to disclose his extra compensation and perks to Systemax or its auditors, so that the amounts reported to shareholders were understated.[17]
In April 2011, Systemax placed Fiorentino on administrative leave. On May 9, 2011, Fiorentino agreed to resign from all of his positions with Systemax, surrender stock and stock options valued at approximately $9.1 million, and repay his 2010 annual bonus of $480,000. With Fiorentino's departure, Robert Leeds, Systemax's founding CEO of the technology division, took over as CEO of Systemax's technology products group.[17][18]
Fiorentino agreed to settle the SEC charges by paying a $65,000 fine and consenting to a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of any publicly held company.[17]
On December 3, 2014, Gilbert and Carl Fiorentino pleaded guilty for their participation in a bribery scheme, after it was found that between during his employment, Carl had received over $7 million in kickbacks from suppliers he had entered into agreements with Systemax, and obscured his participation in these agreements to Systemax. Gilbert was also charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and impeding the operation of the IRS.[19][20]
Restatement[edit]
On February 21, 2005, the company restated financial results for each of the first three quarters of 2004 and the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, following the discovery of certain inventory accounting errors at the company's British unit.[21] On May 11, 2005, the company restated its results for the year 2004, following the discovery of errors in accounting for inventory at its Tiger Direct Inc. unit, an online retailer.[22]

Legal disputes[edit]
On September 17, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged a former director of Systemax Inc for fraudulently reaping hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed compensation between January 2006 to December 2010. The SEC alleged that Gilbert Fiorentino, who in addition to serving on the board was the former chief executive of Systemax’s Technology Products Group in Miami, "obtained more than $400,000 in extra compensation directly from firms that conducted business with Systemax." The SEC also alleged Fiorentino of stealing "several hundred thousand dollars worth of company merchandise that was used to market Systemax’s products." Fiorentino failed to disclose his extra compensation and perks to Systemax or its auditors, so that the amounts reported to shareholders were understated.[17]
In April 2011, Systemax placed Fiorentino on administrative leave. On May 9, 2011, Fiorentino agreed to resign from all of his positions with Systemax, surrender stock and stock options valued at approximately $9.1 million, and repay his 2010 annual bonus of $480,000. With Fiorentino's departure, Robert Leeds, Systemax's founding CEO of the technology division, took over as CEO of Systemax's technology products group.[17][18]
Fiorentino agreed to settle the SEC charges by paying a $65,000 fine and consenting to a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of any publicly held company.[17]
On December 3, 2014, Gilbert and Carl Fiorentino pleaded guilty for their participation in a bribery scheme, after it was found that between during his employment, Carl had received over $7 million in kickbacks from suppliers he had entered into agreements with Systemax, and obscured his participation in these agreements to Systemax. Gilbert was also charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and impeding the operation of the IRS.[19][20]

About SYSTEMAX INC.

Systemax is a direct marketer of computers, electronics, and
technology products in North America and Europe (where it operates
under the Misco brand). Through catalogs, websites, and retail
stores, Systemax markets thousands of brand-name and private-label
computer, networking, camera, GPS, cell phone, video game, and
other electronic products. Systemax also sells material-handling
equipment, shelving, storage items, furniture, and other industrial
products. Its customers include businesses, government agencies,
and schools, as well as individual consumers. Systemax was founded
in 1949 as Global Equipment Company.
Operations
Systemax consists of two business segments: EMEA Technology
Products Group (EMEA) and Industrial Products Group (IPG).
EMEA (standing for Europe, Middle East, and Africa) is the
larger of the two at 55% of company revenue and sells IT products
under the MISCO and Inmac WStore brands. The two sell a range
of electronic products, from consumer electronics such as laptops,
desktop computers, and tablets to network infrastructure and
printers and toner. Inmac WStore is for the Francophone market.
IPG sells to the US and Canadian markets under the brands
Global Industrial, C&H Distributors, Nexel, Avenue Supply,
Global.ca, Industrialsupplies.com, and PFI. It accounts for the
remaining 45% of revenue. Less electronics focused that its
counterpart, IPG sells material handling, storage and shelving,
workbench and shop desks, packaging and supplies, and other
hardware for HVACs, plumbing, and medical professionals.
Geographic Reach
New York-headquartered Systemax rings up about 40% of its sales
in the US, about 15% in the UK, and 25% in France. Other markets in
Europe and North America contribute the remainder.
Sales and Marketing
Systemax counts businesses, government agencies, schools, and
individuals among its consumers.
For business customers, Systemax uses a multi-faceted direct
marketing system comprised of its relationship marketers, catalog
mailings, and proprietary internet websites. Systemax markets to
consumers online through website campaigns, banner ads, and email
campaigns. Its e-commerce initiatives and catalog mailings generate
online orders and calls to inbound sales representatives.
Financial Performance
Systemax is struggling. The company's sales have declined and
its losses have piled up over the past few years, mostly due to
weakness in Systemax's Technology Products business as selling
prices for computers and televisions have declined. The sale of its
North American B2B unit in 2015 virtually halved revenue.
In fiscal 2016, revenue fell a further 9% to $1.7 billion due to
a 9% fall in EMEA revenue, notably due to poor performance in the
UK the exit of MISCO Germany. The Netherlands and France performed
well. IPG revenue saw net growth of 2% (comprising a 3% gain in the
US and a 10% fall in Canada) amid an increase in demand for
material handling, HVAC, and furniture. Higher headcount also
contributed.
Net loss narrowed to $32.6 million from $99.8 million the year
before, due mostly to reductions in loss from continuing and
discontinued operations.
Cash from operating activities swung negative (from $86.5
million to $-57.4 million) due to changes in inventories.
Strategy
Systemax is letting go of more and more deadweight in an
increasingly desperate attempt to stay afloat. The company has sold
off huge chunks of its business, including its North American B2B
unit and most recently its European MISCO operations, excluding
France. France is one of the few of Systemax's business units
performing well, and will form the core of the European business
going forwards.
Mergers and Acquisitions
In January 2015, to grow its business in the industrial products
market, the company's Industrial Products Group purchased B2B
direct marketer Plant Equipment Group (PEG), which specialized in
maintenance, repair, and operation (MRO) products, from TAKKT
America for $25.9 million cash. The deal expanded the IPG presence
in the maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) market.
Company Background
Looking to gain from the ruin of failed US electronics
merchants, Systemax emerged as the winner for the brand,
trademarks, and e-commerce operations of Circuit City in 2009.
Although CircuitCity.com relaunched in mid-2009, Systemax said it
was too early to determine whether retail stores would also make a
comeback.
Unlike Circuit City, Systemax has been expanding CompUSA's
network of retail stores. (It acquired CompUSA's brand, trademarks,
and e-commerce unit, as well as about 15 retail outlets, for $30
million in 2008.) The company rebranded its more than 10 existing
TigerDirect shops as CompUSAs and added five new locations in 2009.
It added about half a dozen more CompUSA stores in 2010. Systemax
said it purchased the electronics giants in an effort to expand its
e-commerce operations, led by TigerDirect, its online computer
sales subsidiary.
The company exited the retail business in the US in 2015 with
the sale of the operations to PCM.
