Georgia-Pacific Products Overview



Today’s Georgia-Pacific is vastly different from the small lumberyard that salesman Owen Cheatham started at Augusta, Ga., in 1927.  Using $6,000 of his own money and $6,000 from investors, Cheatham purchased an existing lumberyard consisting of storage sheds and a small business office and created Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company.  The company survived the Great Depression, and ultimately became a top supplier to the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II.
Georgia-Pacific, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, is headquartered in Atlanta and employs approximately 35,000 people at more than 200 facilities worldwide.

Upgrade Supportability1. Microsoft Dynamics Technical Support can assist with upgrades from a supported version according to the 
   Microsoft Product Lifecycle Policy to a supported version according to the 
   Microsoft Product Lifecycle Policy. For example, Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 to Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 or Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 to Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010 or Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 to Microsoft Dynamics GP 2013.2. Microsoft Dynamics Technical Support can assist with upgrades from a non-supported version according to the 
   Microsoft Product Lifecycle Policy to a supported version according to the 
   Microsoft Product Lifecycle Policy. For example, Microsoft Business Solutions-Great Plains 8.0 to Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 or Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 to Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010.3. Microsoft Dynamics Technical Support cannot assist with upgrades to a non-supported version according to the 
   Microsoft Product Lifecycle Policy even if the end result is a supported version. For example, Microsoft Business Solutions-Great Plains 6.0 to Microsoft Business Solutions- Great Plains 7.5 or Microsoft Business Solutions-Great Plains 7.5 to Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0. 4.  Upgrade services through Advanced Product Support Services are not available  when the end result is a non-supported version according to the 
   Microsoft Product Lifecycle Policy. For example,  Microsoft Business Solutions-Great Plains 6.0 to Microsoft Business Solutions-  Great Plains 7.5 or Microsoft Business Solutions-Great Plains 7.5 to Microsoft  Dynamics GP 9.0. If you have any questions regarding upgrade services, please  reach out to your Microsoft Dynamics GP Partner and ask that they open up an  Advisory Services Request with Microsoft for you. 5. Upgrade services through Advanced Product Support Services are available for  upgrades to a supported version according to the 
   Microsoft Product Lifecycle Policy. For example,  Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 to Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 or Microsoft Dynamics  GP 9.0 to Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010 or Microsoft Business Solutions-Great  Plains 6.0 to Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010. If you have any questions regarding  upgrade services, please reach out to your Microsoft Dynamics GP Partner and  ask that they open up an Advisory Services Request with Microsoft for you. 6. Due to the length and potential complexity of upgrade cases, the following  protocol is used to divide upgrade issues into separate technical support  cases. 
    1. Case 1 - Pre-Upgrade Question 
    2. Case 2 - Installing Microsoft Dynamics GP and running the upgrade in  Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities on the company databases and the modified forms  and reports. 
    3. Case 3 - A potential issue in Microsoft Dynamics GP following the upgrade. NOTE:  If the technical support cases were for a test upgrade and assistance is  required for the live upgrade, a new case will need to be created to  troubleshoot the issues for the live upgrade.     NOTE:  The above  breakdown of Upgrade Cases still requires us to align with our overall policy  of the definition of a support incident which can be found at the following  location:
What is a "Support  Incident"?

Microsoft Dynamics GP is a financial accounting system designed to meet the requirements of small to midsize businesses. Microsoft Dynamics GP was originally developed by North Dakota-based Great Plains Software and was acquired by Microsoft in 2001.
Microsoft Dynamics GP has applications for financial management, human resources management, manufacturing planning, supply chain management, field service, business intelligence, collaboration, compliance and IT management. There are also a la carte modules which can be purchased separately, along with hundreds of third-party applications from independent software vendors (ISVs), which can be added to the system to fit additional needs.
Dynamics GP leverages Microsoft’s Windows and .NET frameworks. The system can be deployed on-site or hosted for a monthly fee. The company and its partners provide benefits such as online training and support.

Pros
The internal controls are great. It overs security for the company because every step is tracked. It's also a big enough program for larger companies. 




Cons
It is very difficult to navigate through and get the reports you want. We're always having to use other software programs to get the financial reports we need.

Like to have drilldown function




Pros
We use Microsoft Dynamics as our accounting software. We are a wholesale industry. We feel it is easy to use. 




Cons
We think it has a limited search function. Like drill down the information to the original entries.

I find this software to be cumbersome and not very user friendly when it comes to things that should flow easily like payroll. I also find the reporting isn't as easily manipulated for individuals that don't have the back-end database tables knowledge. Please keep in mind that we are still using the 2013 version and although our consultant has tried to help with things like smartlist; it's still not as comprehensive as many other systems on the market. 




Pros
The accounting aspect is relatively easy to follow.




Cons
Reporting.

I find this software to be complicated and not at all user friendly.   It seems like you have to repeat information in several different area's that should just flow from one to another.




Pros
I like that you can export your reports in many formats.  I use the pdf and csv formats often.




Cons
You have to repeatedly input information.  I think it should flow from one page to the next.

The basic accounting functions are fine and compares well to peers.  




Cons
We have yet to find an add-on to handle our grant billing that isn't either too simple or too complex for our needs.
Reporting sucks.
Annual maintenance is expensive.

Extremely easy to use for a variety of situations. Never had any unexpected errors as we did with other programs. Used it for 23 Branches and 15 program areas.
The ability to design your on statements with the report writer was great

We had to design one and import/integrate the numbers in which was a headache

I've used this software for 6 years and expect to keep doing so.   There is so much support from our Microsoft partner and GPUG.   




Pros
I love the smartlists.   I also love the adding products available to handle situations like sales taxes.





Cons
There are many different reporting options available to use but are there ever really enough.    




Advice to Others
Visit GPUG.com and look around and see the user's point of view of what the product is about and how it can help you instead of a sales point of view.

I had problems with Microsoft. Specifically, Microsoft crashed on 05/16. Unfortunately, Microsoft Office had a virus. Once I removed that virus, then I may be in a market for a new Toshiba Satellite Laptop. Previously, I had owned my Toshiba Satellite Laptop since 2009. So, I owned that lap for eight years.




Pros
Microsoft Office was good for three things. First, Microsoft Office helped me keep organized. Second, Microsoft Office helped with finances. Third, Microsoft Office helped with communication.




Cons
I had problems with Microsoft.

I am a true believer in Microsoft GP products.  This accounting software, although a bit cumbersome to initially learn, is well worth the education.  The ease with which you can navigate from customer related transactions, to back end AR functions, and over to strictly financial entries, is incomparable.  Many accounting software systems, although quick and easy, do not give you a clear overview of distribution and coding layout.  GP allows you to clearly access what has been recorded, and makes it easy to reverse anything if necessary.  The "Smart List" is one of it's finest features.  This tool allows you to not only access reports, but to streamline, and create reports that are tailored specifically for your needs.  I believe this is one of the best systems out there for processing of manufactured goods, and inventory control.  I highly recommend Microsoft Dynamics GP - Manufacturing!





Pros
Report Building
Distribution and coding clarity
Easy navigation 
Excellent Customer support




Cons
Product does bog down occasionally, if too many people are on it ( usually more a month end kind of issue)
Very detailed - makes for slower learning of system  **However, in the end is worth the work**




Advice to Others
If you have a company that you anticipate growth in - this is the product for you.  Adding new users is an easy task, and comes with the great customer support.
The software does take a little more training to master than some. but is well worth the time invested.  Employees that are using this system, but lack a lot of accounting background. can easily see the steps they have taken, and how to correct them if necessarily.
Well worth the investment!

What Is the FrontRunners Quadrant?
A Graphic of the Top-Performing Accounting Products
FrontRunners quadrants highlight the top software products for North American small businesses. All products in the quadrant are top performers. Small businesses can use FrontRunners to make more informed decisions about what software is right for them.
To create this quadrant, we evaluated over 190 accounting products. Those with the top scores for their capability and value made the quadrant.
Scores are based largely on reviews from real software users, along with other product performance details (e.g., what features they offer, how many customers they have).
Is One Quadrant Better Than the Others?
Nope, Products in Any Quadrant May Fit Your Needs
Every product in this quadrant offers a balance of capability (how much the products can do) and value (whether they’re worth their price/cost) that makes them stand out in the race for small business software success.
FrontRunners has four sub-quadrants:

Upper Right = Leaders: Leaders are all-around strong products. They offer a wide range of functionality to a wide range of customers. These products are considered highly valuable by customers.
 
Upper Left = Masters: Masters may focus more heavily on certain key features or market segments than Leaders do. If you need a more specialized set of functionality without bells and whistles, then a product in the Masters quadrant might be right for you.
 
Lower Right = Pacesetters: Pacesetters may offer a strong set of features, but are not rated as highly on value. For example, a Pacesetter might offer greater functionality, but cost more.
 
Lower Left = Contenders: Contenders may focus on a more specialized set of capabilities that are priced at a higher point. This makes them ideal for companies willing to pay more for specific features that meet their unique needs.

Depending on the specific needs of a software buyer, a product in any of these sub-quadrants could be a good fit.
Why? To even be considered for this FrontRunners, a product had to meet a minimum user rating score of 3.2 for capability and 3.4 for value. This means that all products that qualify as FrontRunners are top-performing products in their market. They appear in the quadrant in relation to how their peers performed.
For some buyers, a specific FrontRunners sub-quadrant might be best. This is because products in the Pacesetters and Leaders sub-quadrants are going to have a more extensive feature set than products in the Contenders or Masters.
What this means is that while all the products on the quadrant meet our minimum market criteria (in this case, core accounting and financial reporting and at least one of the following: fixed asset management and expense management), products in the Pacesetters and Leaders are going to offer additional features as well, such as budgeting and forecasting, inventory or payroll. Conversely, products in the Contenders and Masters sub-quadrants are going to focus more exclusively on the core functionality.
You can download the full FrontRunners for Accounting report here. It contains individual scorecards for each product on the Frontrunners quadrant.
How Are FrontRunners Products Selected?
Products Are Scored Based on User Reviews and Other Data
You can find the full FrontRunners methodology here, but the gist is that products are scored in two areas, Capability and Value.
To be considered at all, products must have at least 10 reviews and meet minimum user rating scores. They also have to offer a core set of functionality—for example, core accounting and financial reporting as well as at least one of the following: fixed asset management and expense management.

Buyer's Guide







 by Lisa Hedges,
Content Analyst
Last Updated: July 25, 2017 







There is a vast array of accounting softwares and financial management solutions on the market today, with specialized functionality for almost any industry or size of organization. Moreover, the specific type of accounting can differ between programs—project, fund and fixed asset are examples.
Add to this variety the constant change of standards, compliance requirements and technology platforms, and the process of selecting enterprise accounting software gets tricky. This buyer's guide is intended to make the process much more bearable.  
Here's what we'll cover:
What Is Accounting System Software? Application Categories What Type of Buyer Are You?Market Trends You Should Understand Benefits & Potential IssuesRecent Events You Should Know About
What Is Accounting System Software? 
Business accounting software keeps track of the financial transactions within an organization. A core package includes the following modules:

General ledger
Accounts receivable
Accounts payable
Payroll
Reporting


Spending statistics in Quicken
These systems occasionally come with specialized functionality for particular types of businesses or companies. An example is fund accounting for nonprofit organizations and government entities. Because it's a critical business process, it's often a central component of an organization's enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.

Application Categories



Core accounting
Core systems assist with the basic functions necessary to balance a business' books, including general ledger functionality, the ability to track accounts payable (A/P) and accounts receivable (A/R), fixed assets and bank reconciliation. Every business requires these core functions to manage its finances.


Project accounting
This type of system helps project-oriented businesses maximize job profitability and efficiency by tracking detailed project costs. Businesses can examine past job costs and estimate future costs to choose the jobs that will achieve adequate profit. It tracks by project factors like labor, overhead, materials and equipment to improve decision-making.


Fund accounting
These solutions support nonprofit and governmental entities in tracking their development and spending of funds. Nonprofit organizations can track their expenditures of donations or grants to make sure they meet fund provider requirements. These systems also allow government entities to make sure they meet unique Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) regulations.


Inventory management
This type of solution helps companies keep the correct inventory levels to maximize profit, avoid overspending and minimize the costs associated with inventory depreciation. The right system keeps inventory information up-to-date by tracking product levels as well as orders, sales and deliveries. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) stipulate specific ways to account for inventory to ensure proper reporting of value for inventory that has depreciated or undergone other changes. Software with inventory management capabilities ensures this is done correctly.


Billing & invoicing
These systems automate the collection of payments from customers to enable timely and consistent collection with minimal human error. There are many different types of billing and invoice systems designed to support the wide range of industries, business models, payment methods and operational scales.


Budgeting & forecasting
Users can leverage budgeting and forecasting solutions to project a company's financial outlook from historical data and estimate future conditions. These systems are typically used in businesses that must consolidate multiple departmental forecasts and budgets, and are most helpful where multiple variables drive the ultimate forecast.


Fixed asset accounting
This type of system tracks fixed assets by providing a central database of important asset information, including location, check-in and check-out, due date for return, maintenance scheduling, audit history, cost and depreciation. Depreciation schedules are a core element of this specialty.


Payroll management
Payroll systems help businesses track and process employee payrolls. They also compose and print paychecks, automatically withhold and pay government taxes and generate the necessary legal and tax reports on a regular basis. Automated reminders to pay required fees help businesses avoid legal penalties.




What Type of Buyer Are You?
Before evaluating your options, you must determine what type of buyer you are. Over 90 percent of buyers fall into one of these three categories:
Growing small-business buyers. These businesses are on the verge of upgrading basic systems, such as QuickBooks, to more robust small-business accounting systems that will support sophisticated functions (such as demand forecasting, intercompany accounts, increased data storage and others). Growing businesses upgrade their systems for a range of reasons. Industry-specific functionality will become important when a small company reaches a certain size threshold.
Enterprise buyers. These buyers represent businesses and organizations that need the functionality of a full enterprise resource planning (ERP) suite. Usually, these systems will include functionality for multi-company consolidation, international operations and foreign currency and other concerns relevant to large entities. Seamless integration is usually more important than specific features; however, there is considerable differentiation in both of these areas, and buyers should examine both. SAP and Oracle, two of the largest vendors, have some of the most feature-rich systems on the market.
Best-of-breed buyers. These buyers are focused on specific functions. For example, nonprofit organizations need to look specifically for accounting software for business that can perform fund accounting. This method tracks funds in such a way that different grant providers can see the right report on how each fund amount has been used. Meanwhile, in education, universities and colleges often need software specific to higher ed, for example to track the disbursement of financial aid. Construction companies or engineering firms, on the other hand, usually need a system that can break down costs by each project, location and other characteristics. For best-of-breed buyers like these, functionality is often more important than integration.

Benefits & Potential Issues
The key benefits of financial management systems are clear: better visibility of costs and expenditures, which leads to more financially responsible decision-making. In addition, systems can generate reports in a variety of ways to summarize this information cleanly for the right audience.
For example, nonprofits can generate reports specific to a particular grant provider, detailing exactly where every cent of the funding ended up. This allows an organization to be accountable to investors, donors and lenders, maintaining trust and avoiding financial damage. These systems also allow companies to ensure compliance with reporting standards and federal requirements.
There are a number of issues that should be avoided when selecting a solution. Buyers in certain vertical industries must make sure the appropriate modules are included in the system they purchase. For example, engineering firms and construction companies should choose a system with a project accounting module.
Another issue is a company's rate of growth; the buyer should consider how fast the company is growing at the time of purchase. This way, the company will not grow out of a system immediately after investing considerable time and funds in the selection and implementation processes.

Market Trends You Should Understand
As you evaluate accounting software packages, consider these current market trends:
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). SaaS is picking up speed as buyers realize the advantages of lower upfront costs and quicker implementation time. NetSuite is a prominent example of a SaaS system: In fact, it is available only as a SaaS offering.
Mobile apps. Mobile applications are gaining popularity across the board, and accounting is no exception. Check to see how each vendor is innovating on this front.
Increased specialization by industry. Increasingly, consumers are demanding more industry-specific features, and vendors are listening. Products that were once “horizontal”—such as Sage MAS 90/200, QuickBooks and Microsoft Dynamics—are increasingly adding new vertical features to cater to buyers’ specific industries. Make sure to keep a lookout for features that fit your particular industry when investigating tools and solutions.
Business intelligence. Interest in business intelligence is on the rise. Business intelligence takes the massive amount of data collected and organizes it into reports designed to support business improvement. Many vendors are now integrating business intelligence into their ERP accounting and financial management systems.

Recent Events You Should Know About
Oracle acquires Netsuite. In July 2016, Oracle purchased Netsuite, further expanding the already impressive reach of its cloud platform. Netsuite’s financial management solution has become a key player in the small and midsize business (SMBs) accounting market, while Oracle is well-known in the enterprise space. It will be interesting to see how this merger will impact customers in the long term—in the interim, users should expect more integrations between NetSuite and Oracle products.
Sage adds chatbot and AI to cloud accounting software. Initially launched at the Sage Summit conference in 2016, Sage officially released its chatbot with its Sage One software in January 2017. The chatbot, Pegg, uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide businesses with a “virtual accounting assistant.” With Pegg, users can track receipts, submit expenses, see which customers are behind on invoices and more.
Zoho launches customized payment solution: Zoho Checkout. Zoho’s newest addition to their financial suite is a customizable online payments solution designed for businesses of all size. Users can build and brand a secure payment page, connect with a payment gateway and collect one-time and recurring payments from customers. Zoho Checkout is available in both free and paid plans, with capabilities increasing as plans scale.
