Kestrel Investment Management - About Us













































































				About Us			


Focused on Portfolio Management and Individualized Client Service
Kestrel Investment Management Corporation is a registered investment adviser, located in the San Francisco Bay Area. When Abbott Keller and David Steirman founded Kestrel in 1993 they did so with a commitment to limiting the amount of capital they would manage, recognizing that higher levels of AUM can often drag on performance results. This continues as a central tenet at Kestrel and it enables us to focus on what is most important, portfolio management and attentive client service. Rather than engaging in the time and resource-intensive endeavor of gathering more assets, our priority is attending to the individual needs of each client. This allows our investment team to focus 100% on analyzing companies and constructing client portfolios, using our internally-derived research.
Single Investment Approach
Our strategy is the result of many years of refining and improving upon our original theory; that inefficiencies exist in the area of small-cap equities, where managements undertake voluntary restructuring programs (buybacks, spin-offs, and asset sales). Abbott developed this investment strategy over thirty years ago based on the belief that these stocks are more likely to produce superior appreciation.
Small Firm Culture with Big Firm Infrastructure
Since executing our first trade for our first client in 1993, our world has changed quite dramatically. Technology has evolved, as has the regulatory landscape within which we operate, shifting the way we communicate and partner with our clients. What has not changed over that time period, however, is our commitment to client service. We believe in embracing these changes and have found that superior client service requires a well-designed operations infrastructure. We continue to invest in high quality systems that enable us to meet the demands of our most discerning institutional clients. Our state-of-the-art trading, portfolio accounting and trade confirmation tools are robust yet flexible, and are a reflection of our commitment to delivering the information our clients require, at the time they need it, and in the format that best suits them.
  





 



About UsStrategyTeam



 



 



Our strategy is based on our belief that the stocks of small-cap companies undergoing voluntary restructuring are more likely to produce superior price appreciation.  Abbott established this strategy over 30 years ago and we have continued to refine it over time.

Kestrel Investment Management - Strategy













































































				Investment Strategy			


Overview
Kestrel specializes in analyzing restructurings, such as corporate share repurchases, spin-offs and asset sales, in order to identify companies where management is actively working to increase shareholder value. Our experience and research, over more than thirty years, convince us that companies selected from this segment are more likely to produce superior long-term returns for their shareholders.
We invest in companies with managements who have implicitly identified their stock as undervalued and who are taking concrete steps to improve their share valuation. For this reason, we find the risk/return relationship of our approach to be particularly attractive.
 
Our Investment Approach
A Purely Bottom-Up Value Manager
We are often asked to fit the Kestrel strategy into a particular defined investment style.  Are we “value”, “growth”, “sector-driven”?   While our strategy may include aspects of each at any given time, we are a purely bottom-up value investor.   The degree to which our portfolio resembles other designated styles from quarter-to-quarter is merely the result of our unique investment process, rather than that of any preconceived mandate.
Negative Screen Approach to Stock Selection
When it comes to picking stocks we look at things differently. Our process is meticulous; we follow all the stocks in our defined universe (U.S. companies listed on a national exchange, with market capitalizations of $100 million to $3.5 billion, that are undergoing some sort of voluntary restructuring) and then apply a negative screen to eliminate companies that don’t meet our requirements, be they fundamental, or governance related.
We’ve found that our negative screening process helps us avoid the bias that occurs when managers become enamored with their stocks. We would characterize our approach as objective and systematic. This is not to say that we are a quantitative manager; we use traditional tools in our analysis, with a strong focus on cash flow and thoughtful consideration of company-specific corporate governance.
Why Small-Cap Orientation?
Kestrel’s small-cap orientation stems from our observation that shares of companies lacking institutional coverage are more likely to be inefficiently priced. We also find that companies in the small-cap arena provide us with clearer management signals, an important component of our investment process. In contrast, restructurings at larger capitalized companies are undertaken more regularly, and are motivated by a host of other factors unrelated to share valuation.
Unconstrained, Long-Term Focus
We are not constrained by industry considerations; companies undergoing restructuring can be found across sectors and the available opportunity set at any given time tends to reflect where value is present. We are not market timers nor are we macroeconomic forecasters; we believe that our comparative advantage resides in discerning unrecognized microeconomic trends and identifying misperceived factors. We avoid the pitfalls of Wall Street’s notorious short-term focus by holding individual stocks for an average period of eighteen months to three years.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
