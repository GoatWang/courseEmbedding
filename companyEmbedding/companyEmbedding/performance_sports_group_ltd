Why Performance Sports Group Is On The Rise - Performance Sports Group Ltd. (NYSE:PSG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Why Performance Sports Group Is On The RiseApr.15.16 | About: Performance Sports (PSG) Peter Ostrowski Long only, Growth, research analyst, momentumSummaryMacroeconomic issues.Sports Authority's chapter 11 bankruptcy.Strong product base.Big investors keeping stake in company.Performance Sports Group (NYSE:PSG) is a leading manufacturer of many different sports products. The main product brands that bring value to this company are Bauer Hockey and Easton brands. At the end of the fiscal year 2015, hockey represented $418.4 million in sales or 64% of total revenue while baseball represented $199.3 million or 30% of total revenue. According to the 2016 annual report, PSG stated that Easton is the leader in diamond sports with 27% of the market share. Bauer sports also has the number one market share in hockey as shown below: 

 This is directly from the 10k which lists Bauer to have an estimated 56% of the market share of a roughly $700 million industry. This is to show the strong brands that are currently supporting this struggling company. Macroeconomic effects This past year PSG ran into multiple headwinds. They all affected revenue growth but it is important to note which issues were simply out of control and part of the business. The forex issues were related to the weakening of the Canadian dollar in relation to the US dollar over the past year. There were also issues in the overall demand for hockey products over the past year. This tends to be a cyclical business that is up and down as years progress. Sports Authority PSG is a huge supplier to Sports Authority. As a result of Sports Authority's recent chapter 11 bankruptcy, sales have decreased and investor confidence significantly decreased. Sports Authority is currently in the midst of closing 140 stores as they have recently began huge liquidation sales to try to pay off their billion dollars worth of debt. The closings of these stores have impacted the price of PSG significantly; however, I do not believe the entirety of the decrease in price is justified. The rest of this article will discuss the upside potential of PSG and why I believe it is currently at its trough.
 Key Investors The price has been significantly increasing these past two days after Wellington Management Group decided to keep a stake in PSG. The reported filing shows a 5.93% passive stake. This shows that Wellington is still bullish on PSG as they are the second highest investor behind Sagard Capital. The market seems to have forgotten the huge brands that PSG currently owns. These two investment companies have not. The fact that they are still bullish shows a high opportunity for growth. This also hints at a solid earnings report this Friday which is causing market excitement. Acquisition Potential Sagard Capital upped their stake in PSG last month. They currently own 15.06% of PSG. Sagard Capital's strategy is to take significant minority positions in small- to mid-cap stocks; then it will sponsor teams to help take struggling companies private. As Sagard Capital has already appointed their CEO Daniel Friedberg to PSG's board, it seems that they have already taken initiative for their strategy. Sagard Capital has a history of doing this as I will give a few recent examples. Sagard Capital completed a deal in 2012, where they personally purchased Intramed America for $14.05/share with a total purchase price of $169.5 million. The price jumped from $11 when it was announced that Sagard Capital would be acquiring them. Even more important to note is the success X-Rite had when Daniel Friedman was appointed to the board of directors. X-Rite was acquired by Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) for a 39% premium. Recent price increases With the earnings report coming up this Friday, large amounts of speculation are artificially increasing the price. This is largely due to the 13D that was recently filed with Wellington Management Group as previously stated. When big investors show that they want to hold a large majority interest in a company (over 5%), other investors react to this in a bullish fashion. I believe this company is still undervalued but be weary of the significant increases. These investors most likely believe that there is going to be some sort of acquisition or positive analysis in the transcript.
 Financials It is important to look to past financials to show the profitability this company used to bring in comparison to its competitors. Below I have created a chart to show the underperformance of this company in the past year: 

 The past year's profitability measures of PSG are low because of the decreases in revenue which I have discussed earlier. In PSG's earnings report today they will most likely discuss future plans to increase revenues with the bankruptcy of Sports Authority. The company is currently highly leveraged with $452 million of long-term debt. There is no danger of bankruptcy as they have a working capital of $204.6 million that consists of $174.5 million in inventories. The inventory turnover days have actually decreased over the past few years as shown below: (Source: Bloomberg)

 This shows that they are selling off their inventory at a faster rate than any other year. They are then using this capital to pay off debt and invest back into the business. Valuation In order to estimate an acquisition target value, I have used CapitalIQ for their quick comp transactions. I have sorted through the comparables as necessary. For this I have used EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT. Below I have attached the list of transactions and their multiples. 


 Using these general multiples and the average analysts estimated EBITDA and EBIT, I am estimating that PSG will be acquired for a price of around $300 million, with 45.6 million shares outstanding this is a price of around $6.57 per share. This represents a large upside potential for investors if PSG is acquired. The 3-year forward EV/EBITDA which I have calculated using analyst future estimates from Bloomberg shows an even higher upside potential as I have demonstrated below:  The enterprise value was calculated adding total debt to equity and subtracting cash. Conclusion In conclusion, I would recommend a buy on PSG. I believe this stock is still very cheap and has strong products within their company. When I valued this company using a DCF model, I did find issues with their operating costs. The analysts are currently estimating the next quarters to be around 90%, and it will be difficult for PSG to operate without lowering those costs to around 85% for the long run. I am pricing this stock as an acquisition target because of the current minority holders of this stock.

Performance Sports Groups Headwinds And Their Continued Growth - Performance Sports Group Ltd. (NYSE:PSG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Performance Sports Groups Headwinds And Their Continued GrowthNov.12.14 | About: Performance Sports (PSG) Michael Ambrozewicz Long/short equity, Growth, research analyst, long-term horizonSummaryIncreasing intense competition from other competitors in the sporting goods industry.The lack of a youthful sales force as a foundation for future growth.Concerns in administration and improving their balance sheet.Performance Sports Group Ltd. (PSG), formerly Bauer Performance Sports, is a publicly traded stock in the New York Stock Exchange. It is a leading international hockey supplier and has recently incorporated lacrosse, baseball and uniforms to expand its supply chain. It's a company that is deeply rooted in Canadian psychic and eager to expand their investor base into the United States. However, it's one of the few companies that I can say with certainty that will remain neutral in the $17.00 to $21.00 range.
There's a very disturbing trend that Bauer Hockey, a branch under Performance Sports Group, incorporated with respect to how retailers market their products. Retailers in Canada, USA, and Europe are required to retail Bauer products at the suggested retail price, regardless of how dominant the retailer is in the market. Their conventional wisdom, and by that I mean sales managers that were brought into the organization from the old Cooper days, have indicated that the purchasing consumer relies on a 35 mile radius to purchase hockey equipment. Competitors such as Reebok/CCM, Warrior, Easton, have suggested to retailers for their elite level products that a "call for pricing" is in effect. In fact, the Reebok/CCM sales manager said that in times of slow business where you must move product, the "call for pricing" allows retailers to move stock quicker and get a return on investment. Reebok/CCM had their biggest and most successful launch with reviving the Tacks brand. In fact, retailers can't keep up with the demand.
Performance Sports Group exacerbated their problem by not allowing retailers to move product in a timely fashion and to repeat with them. With Bauer products, retailers will book and not repeat. Even if Bauer has a new product launch, retailers will have a reservation to book more than their required minimum. In the long run, they will maintain revenue but never exceed expectations. How do I know this? I worked part-time in a hockey store for five years supporting my education. Bauer hockey developed a certain moat by dominating the hockey market. However, this "moat" they developed is plagued with a tinge of arrogance, which is counterproductive to revenue growth. They have the best and the most innovative products in the world, but this is not reflected by their sales force. Many times the Bauer representative would come into the store, tell a couple of jokes, and leave without an order. The Reebok/CCM, Warrior, and Easton representatives represent a younger and more driven generation. Any time my former boss gave me an open to buy budget, the younger Reebok/CCM, Warrior, and Easton reps were much more eager to rake in revenue and promote their brand.

Apple's (AAPL) success story is based on innovative products. Their sales force from top to bottom is based on youth which has become a key foundation in their growth story. Performance Sports Group lacks a young and energetic sales force that can religiously convey why retailers should deploy 70% of their shelf space to Bauer products. When I met the new Reebok/CCM representative, the first words that came out of his mouth were, "I want 60% of your shelf space, what will it take?"
Increased revenue is based on the allocation of shelf space. A company's moat relies on its ability to understand its competition, the marketplace, and the role the company plays to increase their revenue in the environment. What they need to do is target other companies so that they do not gain a competitive advantage over them. Through acquisition, Performance Sports Group was able to generate revenue year-round, a positive sign for investors. But in order for Performance Sports Group to think globally and execute their goals, they need to emphasize the fact that by having innovative products they need the most innovative sales force. This comes with youth instead of an old boys' club living in the past. Investors invest in youth, motivated management, and innovation. The reason why is because it provides them with confidence that a revenue stream is likely to continue.
Hockey is one of the few sports that demand an enormous amount of commitment from parents. Costs involving hockey registration are up 30% since 1999. Gas prices also continue to rise, making travel to and from hockey more expensive. Hockey equipment is not supplied by most organizations anymore. Escalating real estate prices have made building arenas infeasible and non-profitable from an economic standpoint. If arenas in Canada and the USA are not being built then the revenue from hockey will slowly begin to deteriorate. Even the 5% growth that the US has experienced in hockey registration over the past year pales in comparison in the amount of kids who have not played hockey since the 2008-2009 recession. It is one of the few sports heavily impacted by slowdowns in economic business cycles. If there are expectations of interest rates rising in the US and Canada, then hockey parents will be the first to consider alternative sports to replace hockey. House league registration is down across Canada in both urban and rural areas. The shift in demographics across North America has resulted in a smaller proportion of kids as the population continues to age. Men's recreational hockey leagues have also suffered as the awareness for injuries such as concussions have been shown to be more dangerous than previously thought. The recreational leagues cater from men 25-45 years of age which have a high disposable income for the purchase of hockey equipment. In general, hockey suppliers are ignoring this huge market as the potential for growth continues to dwindle.

What Performance Sports Group did successfully through acquisition was increasing their market share in hockey, lacrosse, and perhaps more importantly, baseball. The hockey equipment market is less fragmented than that of baseball. You have two dominant suppliers and maybe one or two fringe suppliers that retailers rely upon in the business of hockey equipment. In a stagnant hockey market, that is good for Bauer. The only growth is by taking away market shares from competitors such as Reebok/CCM. The baseball market is crowded with large suppliers such as Rawlings, Wilson, Mizuno, etc. who dominate in certain categories that help distinguish themselves from others. However, through the recent acquisition of Easton, Bauer has taken over as the dominant supplier of baseball bats. In lacrosse, Bauer dominates the business of head protection through their line of Cascade helmets. However, Warrior, Brine and STX still come out on top in terms of supplying teams with protective gear. At over $300 million per year, the team business stands out as a lucrative growth for businesses looking for additional revenue.
It's interesting to note that Performance Sports Group took a different approach with their business model. They hired sales representatives to go directly to teams and allocate their business to a limited amount of retailers. Retailers who don't get the business push the competitor's products instead. By going directly to teams, Bauer is unable to charge more for team-wear and team uniforms. The team-wear business is one of the few businesses that carry depreciating margins because teams expect low prices every year. Additionally, if Bauer is late to deliver their product, they continually have to make amends in order to receive business for the following year, thus reducing margins even further. Other competitors that traditionally use retailers as an intermediary have also gone directly to teams to compete with Bauer. Since Bauer went directly to teams for direct business, who's responsible if the team decides to not pay the bill? The retailer should not be liable for unpaid team business as a result of Bauer choosing to handle all the work directly. Even though CCM has an NHL licensing agreement I can see them further strengthening their jersey line by purchasing companies like Athletic Knit that directly competes with Inaria. Athletic Knit is a global leader in the jersey business and produced in Canada. With Athletic Knit, many hockey associations know that their deliveries are always on time, and they can take that to the bank.

Kohlberg Management VI, LLC recently completed an additional sell-down in its position in Performance Sports Group of approximately 2 million common shares, resulting in aggregate proceeds for Kohlberg of CAD $37,550,000. The sell-down of the position leaves Kohlberg with 5.3% of Performance Sports Group's issued and outstanding common shares on a non-diluted basis which still maintains their position of being one of the largest shareholders of the company.
Performance Sports Group's first quarter results turned out to be fairly successful. The company reported a strong 28% in total revenue vs. a year ago, an 8% increase in hockey revenue and 7% increase in lacrosse revenue. Adjusted Gross Profit increased 19% to $73.4 million and adjusted EBITDA grew 8% to $39.9 million. An increase in assets coupled with a decrease in liabilities and an increase in equity signals a very positive outlook on the future of the company, especially from a shareholder's point of view. However, even though gross profits increased, the large expenditure in selling, general and administrative expenses resulted in a lower value of net and comprehensive income. Basic earnings per common share decreased from $0.61 to $0.27 and diluted earnings per common share from $0.57 to $0.26. Even though more shares were issued, the loss suffered in earnings per common share shouldn't have been as drastic as they turned out to be, which can be partially blamed on the large increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Other NYSE-listed sporting good companies including Under Armour (UA) and Nike Inc. (NKE) generally follow a percentage-of-sales or net income approach when dealing with their expenses. For example, from 2013 to 2014 Under Armour experienced an approximate increase in gross profit of 29.2% and an approximate 26% increase in net income. Accordingly, Under Armour's SG&A expenses experienced reasonable growth of an approximate 29.9%. On the other hand, Performance Sports Group's increase in SG&A expenses of approximately 38% is quite large in comparison to its 7% increase in gross profit and -46% decrease in net income. When examining similar companies in the same industry as Performance Sports Group, such a large increase in SG&A can signal a problem for the common investor who may question how efficiently management is spending the company's money and whether valuable cash flow is being wasted.

What is encouraging is that the company's long-term debt levels decreased while their short-term debt levels increased. What is discouraging is that none of the upper management owns any shares. RBC has a price target of $20, Wunderlich's price target is $24, and Imperial Capital's price target is $21. It has a 50-day average of $16.78. I feel that this stock is fairly valued and the average price of approximately $20.64 should hold. With future headwinds of the higher US dollar, rising costs of raw materials, and a declining hockey market may prove to be more challenging for Performance Sports Group. The acquisitions they made were good and investors can be assured of year-round revenue. Their sales force needs improvement, and until then, I have a long-term hold on it of $20.
Even though Adidas AG (OTCQX:ADDDF) is divesting their interest in Reebok, Adidas will make a bid for the National Hockey League's jerseys in 2016. They have more capital and resources available, giving them a substantial advantage over Performance Sports Group in the execution of such a potential deal. Adidas has two choices with CCM, either they sell it or come to terms with the fact that hockey has become a duopoly. The advantage of a duopoly is less fragmentation due to only two competitors in the marketplace. The question is whether or not Adidas is serious in increasing capital expenditure towards CCM to gain on Performance Sports Group's market share. This will demonstrate that the Adidas CEO is confident in translating the increase in hockey market share towards overall market share in the sporting goods industry.
A duopoly should not be undermined, it should be viewed as an opportunity to increase revenue. CCM and Reebok dominate the goalie market in the National Hockey League even though Bauer has indicated that they are the leaders of this position. We need to clarify that Bauer has 54% of the head protection market for goaltenders. However, in terms of protective goal equipment, Reebok and CCM own about 50% of the overall market share. Bauer comes at a distant third in protective goal equipment. 65% of boutique hockey store revenues are generated through the sale of composite sticks, individually ranging from $59.99 to $299.99. Many retailers wait for closeout lists to purchase these sticks. Manufacturers such as Warrior, Easton, CCM, etc. come out with closeout lists, taking away available dollars to purchase Bauer equipment. CCM composite sticks in the high $200 range are less expensive for retailers than Bauer sticks in the same price range. Closeouts play a significant role increasing margins of hockey retailers. Suppliers such as Easton, CCM, and Warrior offer closeout lists for every retailer in the market. On the other hand, Performance Sports Group fails to recognize the importance of closeout lists as they only offer them to a select few. Again, it's based on patronage from an old boy's club instead of valuing revenue as revenue. Competitors' closeouts are not going to return to normal levels anytime soon. In fact, retailers have indicated that closeouts are coming out earlier than previous years. Furthermore, it takes away open-to-buy and creates an anticipatory reaction from retailers to purchase products at a lower price. For Bauer, competitors' closeouts provide very little visibility for product repeat demand and may not translate into realized sales or future growth. What's alarming is that closeouts reinforce the core business of hockey, a sport that is shrinking and deteriorating at a quicker pace than many have anticipated. According to the Sports and Fitness Industry, global hockey participation and registration has grown at a measly 1% annually over the last eight years.

What Performance Sports Group does effectively is spreadsheet coaching. The focus is on sales staff hitting numbers. The innovation that is taking place in hockey equipment should translate in exceeding expectations rather than meeting a quota. What Performance Sports Group lacks is a follow-through in sales which ultimately leads to fizzling sales momentum. As an investor, I want Performance Sports Group to exceed their expectations. Brand-name exposure in the National Hockey League and social media are good tools for creating demand knowledge and perhaps the experience for the product. However, a strong and innovative sales force is able to articulate to retailers that their money is well spent. In the long run, this translates into rewards for investors.

Performance Sports Group Ltd. Enters Chapter 11
October 31, 2016 

Sadie Keljikian, Express Trade Capital
Performance Sports Group Ltd. has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada. The company announced that it was facilitating a restructuring and sale of nearly all of its assets on Monday morning.
Performance, maker of Bauer ice hockey gear, announced that it would auction its assets to reconcile its debt. The announcement, however, came after Performance had a deal to sell a majority of its assets to Brookfield Asset Management for just over $575 million. Brookfield, an investor group, is led by Sagard Capital and Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. Former Chairman of Performance Graeme Roustan said in August that he was working with investment banks to find a bid. On Friday, Reuters clarified by reporting that Performance would enter bankruptcy protection with a buyer in hand and would seek out higher bids.
It is important to note that Performance’s difficulties demonstrate a wider national trend. Recently, increased competition in North American sporting goods manufacturing presents numerous challenges to all domestically based members of the industry. Due to the industry’s recent turmoil, Sports Authority Holdings Inc. have taken some financial hits in recent months as well. The retailer filed for bankruptcy in March, triggering a $90 million loss of Performance Sports inventory, according to Wall Street Journal.
Performance listed both its assets and liabilities in the range of $500 million to $1 billion. The company listed both amounts in its voluntary petition filed under Chapter 11 in Delaware.
Despite the numerous complexities of this case, Performance claims that operations will continue as usual during the bankruptcy process. Brookfield and existing lenders will provide $386 million debtor-in-possession financing. Performance also announced management changes, President Amir Rosenthal and Executive Vice President Todd Harmon left on Friday. Furthermore, Dan Sills was named executive vice president of hockey, Mike Thorne is now executive vice president of baseball and softball, and Jennifer Hughey was named senior vice president in charge of supply chain management.

(  NYSE :  PSG ) (  TSX :  PSG ) ("Performance Sports Group" or the "Company"), a leading developer and manufacturer of high performance sports equipment and apparel, reported financial results for its fiscal third quarter and nine months ended February 28, 2015. All figures are in U.S. dollars.Fiscal Q3 2015 Financial Highlights vs. Year-Ago QuarterRevenues up 121% to a record $137.7 million (up 127% in constant currency)   Hockey revenues up 9% to a record $53.9 million (up 16% in constant currency)   Lacrosse revenues up 19%   Adjusted Gross Profit up 134% to $46.3 million with Adjusted Gross Profit margin up 180 basis points to 33.6%   Adjusted EBITDA up significantly to $14.4 million from a loss of $3.0 million   Adjusted Net Income up significantly to $6.2 million or $0.13 per share from a loss of $4.2 million or $(0.11) per share   Management Commentary"We reported another record quarter due to the continued strong performance of EASTON and 16% organic sales growth," said Kevin Davis, president and CEO of Performance Sports Group. "EASTON continued to experience solid demand for its MAKO family of products, including the revolutionary TORQ bat. Our hockey business had its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, up 16% on a constant currency basis and driven by the successful launch of our VAPOR 1X stick, underscoring our well-defined strategy to grow our stick business -- the largest hockey category. With this launch, our stick category grew 26% in constant currency year-to-date and 92% in Q3."Our third quarter results also benefited from the resurgence in our lacrosse business, with revenues up 19%. After completing a simple modification to the CASCADE R helmet early in the second quarter, the brand experienced a strong uptick in both January and February, and delivered 11% helmet sales growth for the quarter. We also continued to see growth in every equipment category of our MAVERIK line due to continued strength in our OPTIK and TANK heads, as well as our new line of shafts and gloves."Our consolidated business continues to perform well despite currency headwinds that have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact -- particularly on our hockey business. For perspective, changes in foreign currency have reduced our year-to-date Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.17 compared to the same period last year. The U.S. dollar has strengthened even further as we head into two very significant quarters for our hockey business. This $0.17 decline is a clear example of how foreign currency markets continue to impact our reported results, but it also reflects the strength of our business and our ability to generate strong results despite these volatile currency markets."Fiscal Q3 2015 Financial ResultsRevenues in the fiscal third quarter of 2015 increased 121% to $137.7 million compared to $62.2 million in the same year-ago quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 127%. The increase was primarily due to the addition of revenues generated by EASTON and solid growth in ice hockey equipment, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the results of EASTON, as well as the impact from foreign exchange, revenues grew organically by 16%.Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-IFRS measure) in the third quarter increased 134% to $46.3 million compared to $19.8 million in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenues, Adjusted Gross Profit increased 180 basis points to 33.6% compared to 31.8% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in Adjusted Gross Profit margin was primarily driven by the addition of EASTON, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange (see "Non-IFRS Measures" below for further discussion).SG&A expenses in the third quarter increased 37% to $33.7 million compared to $24.5 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the addition of EASTON and higher sales and marketing costs. As a percentage of revenues and excluding acquisition-related charges, share-based payment expenses and costs related to a lacrosse helmet decertification, SG&A expenses decreased significantly to 21.0% compared to 32.8% in the year-ago quarter.R&D expenses in the third quarter increased 28% to $6.1 million compared to $4.7 million in the year-ago quarter due to continued focus on product development and the addition of EASTON. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses decreased 320 basis points to 4.4% compared to 7.6% in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) increased significantly to $14.4 million compared to a loss of $3.0 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase was due to the addition of EASTON, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA was $17.5 million.Read MoreAdjusted Net Income (a non-IFRS measure) in the third quarter increased significantly to $6.2 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $4.2 million or $(0.11) per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. The impact of foreign exchange reduced Adjusted Net Income by approximately $0.05 per diluted share compared to the third quarter last year.On February 28, 2015, working capital was $338.6 million compared to $179.9 million on February 28, 2014, primarily due to the acquisition of EASTON and investment in the Company's apparel business. Excluding the acquisition, working capital was $230.6 million as of February 28, 2015, an increase of 28% versus the prior year.Total debt was $431.2 million at February 28, 2015 compared to $130.8 million at February 28, 2014. Performance Sport Group's leverage ratio, as defined in the Company's credit agreements, stood at 3.87x as of February 28, 2015 compared to 2.51x one year ago. The increase reflects the Company's financing of the EASTON acquisition.Nine Month Fiscal 2015 Financial ResultsRevenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 increased 52% to $507.1 million compared to $333.3 million in the same year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 56%. Excluding the results of EASTON, as well as the impact from foreign exchange, revenues grew organically by 11%.Adjusted Gross Profit in the first nine months increased 50% to $181.9 million compared to $120.9 million in the year-ago period. As a percentage of revenues, Adjusted Gross Profit was 35.9% compared to 36.3% in the same year-ago period.SG&A expenses increased 40% to $109.0 million compared to $77.8 million in the same period a year ago. As a percentage of revenues and excluding acquisition-related charges, share-based payment expenses and costs related to the lacrosse helmet decertification, SG&A expenses decreased 150 basis points to 18.8% compared to 20.3% in the first nine months of fiscal 2014.R&D expenses increased 37% to $18.0 million compared to $13.1 million in the year-ago period. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses decreased 30 basis points to 3.6% compared to 3.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2014.Adjusted EBITDA increased 65% to $78.5 million compared to $47.7 million in the year-ago period. Without the impact of currency fluctuations, Adjusted EBITDA increased 84% to $87.8 million.Adjusted Net Income in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 increased 51% to $40.0 million or $0.87 per diluted share, compared to $26.5 million or $0.71 per diluted share in the year-ago period. The impact of foreign exchange reduced Adjusted Net Income by approximately $0.17 per diluted share compared to the same period last year.Segment ReviewHockey revenues in the third quarter increased 9% to $53.9 million, driven by the new VAPOR 1X stick launch, partially offset by the shift in timing of certain orders to earlier this year and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Excluding currency impacts, hockey revenues increased 16% in the quarter due to composite stick sales growth of 92%.Hockey EBITDA was a loss of $4.0 million in the third quarter compared to a loss of $3.2 million in the year-ago period. The slight decrease was due to the impact of foreign exchange, which more than offset higher revenues in the quarter. Excluding foreign exchange, Hockey EBITDA increased $2.5 million or 78%.Baseball/Softball revenues in the third quarter increased significantly to $71.9 million from $2.9 million in the year-ago period due to the addition of EASTON.Baseball/Softball EBITDA in the third quarter increased substantially to $18.9 million from a loss of $0.1 million in the year-ago period.Revenues in the Other Sports segment, which comprises lacrosse and soccer, increased 19% to $11.9 million. This was driven by 19% growth in lacrosse, including an 11% increase from CASCADE and growth in every equipment category of the MAVERIK brand. CASCADE benefited from the resumption of helmet shipments following the recertification of the R helmet and all other current models. MAVERIK continued to see strong demand for its new line of heads and shafts, as well as its new protective equipment and team gloves.Other Sports EBITDA in the third quarter increased 11% to $2.1 million from $1.9 million in the year-ago period. This was driven by growth in lacrosse revenues, partially offset by lower gross margins in lacrosse due to higher inventory reserves and lower margins on lacrosse helmets as a result of changes required for the recertification of the CASCADE R helmet.Conference CallPerformance Sports Group will hold a conference call tomorrow, April 14, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss its fiscal 2015 third quarter results.The Company's President and CEO Kevin Davis and CFO Amir Rosenthal will host the conference call, followed by a question and answer period.Date: Tuesday, April 14, 2015 Time: 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time) Toll-free dial-in number: 1-888-427-9419 International dial-in number: 1-719-325-2323 Conference ID: 3362697Please call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

Hard copies of the Company's complete audited annual financial statements are available upon request free of charge.Non-IFRS MeasuresAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Net Income/Loss are non-IFRS measures. These non-IFRS measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. When used, these measures are defined in such terms as to allow the reconciliation to the closest IFRS measure. These measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analyses of the Company's financial information reported under IFRS. The Company uses non-IFRS measures, such as Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Net Income/Loss, to provide investors with a supplemental measure of its operating performance and thus highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. The Company also believes that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. The Company also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets, and to assess its ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditure, and working capital requirements.Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Net Income/Loss are non-IFRS measures. Adjusted Gross Profit is defined as gross profit plus the following expenses which are part of cost of goods sold: (i) amortization and depreciation of intangible assets, (ii) non-cash charges to cost of goods sold resulting from fair market value adjustments to inventory as a result of business acquisitions, (iii) reserves established to dispose of obsolete inventory acquired from acquisitions and (iv) other one-time or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (net income adjusted for income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, losses related to amendments to the credit facility, gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets, net interest expense, deferred financing fees, unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments, and realized and unrealized gains/losses related to foreign exchange revaluation) before restructuring and other one-time or non-cash charges associated with acquisitions, other one-time or non-cash items, pre-Canadian initial public offering sponsor fees, costs related to share offerings, as well as share-based payment expenses. Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income/Loss divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted Net Income/Loss is defined as net income adjusted for all unrealized gains/losses related to derivative instruments and unrealized gains/losses related to foreign exchange revaluation, non-cash or incremental charges associated with acquisitions, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for acquisitions since the Company's initial public offering in Canada, costs related to share offerings, share-based compensation expense and other non-cash or one-time items.Further discussion of these non-IFRS measures to the relevant reported results can be found in the tables at the end of this press release and in the Company's MD&A for the third quarter under "Non-IFRS Reconciliations."All references to "constant currency" reflect the impact of translating the current period results at the monthly foreign exchange rates from the prior year period. This translation impact does not include the impact of foreign exchange on the Company's direct material costs or gains/losses on derivatives.
