Many religions have created rituals and dogmas that separate one from the other and cling to the belief that only they have the "one truth." But are any of them actually right? Can the true essence of God ever truly be understood or explained?  iGod traces how the various belief systems about God have evolved into what exists in the present day, and then delves into the many questions about God that so many people have asked throughout history. Perhaps through this exploration we can finally begin to understand what God really is, what God wants, why we are here and how we can create a better world both for ourselves and future generations.

                           "Examining ideas ranging from world systems theory to postmodernism, Jonathan Friedman investigates the relations between
                              the global and the local, to show how cultural fragmentation and modernist homogenization are equally constitutive trends
                              of global reality. With examples taken from a rich variety of theoretical sources, ethnographic accounts and historical eras,
                              the analysis ranges across the cultural formations of ancient Greece, contemporary processes of Hawaiian cultural identification
                              and Congolese beauty cults. Throughout, the author examines the interdependency of the world market and local cultural transformations,
                              and demonstrates the complex interrelations between globally structured social processes and the organization of identity."
                              "Jonathan Friedman also documents the development and significance of a global perspective in an anthropology that illuminates
                              a wide variety of domains from prehistory to world hegemony. In so doing, he interrogates the emergence of the concept of
                              culture and suggests that anthropology itself is best understood within the trajectory of modernity."--Jacket

                           "Modernity and identity" is a collective work which announces a radical new departure within contemporary debates on modernism
                              and postmodernism. While dominant conceptions of both modernism and postmodernism are centred around notions of stasis and
                              fixity, for most of the otherwise quite diverse writers in this book modernity is a matter of "movement", or "flux", or "change",
                              and of "unpredictability". Modernity and postmodernity are shown to mean, not the "end of the subject", but instead the transformation
                              and creation of new forms of subjectivity. Anthropological concepts are brought squarely into the heart of the modernity controversies,
                              which are then recast in the context of tradition, of globalization, and of the crises of identity in a newly de-centred world
                              system. The book opens up the possibility of a "third way", rejecting the opposition between the impersonal rationality of
                              high modernism and the irrationalist anti-ethics of postmodernism. The vision in this book is that of "another" modernity,
                              which counterposes Baudelaire to Rousseau, and localist ethics to abstract bluebrints for social and political re-organization

                           A dozen essays by US and European urbanists, anthropologists, sociologists, and political scientists develop an approach to
                              understanding the increasing violence that has occurred on a global scale over the past couple decades, and try to construct
                              a more adequate comprehension of global processes than has been provided in the language of globalization. Among the topics
                              are class projects, social consciousness, and the contradictions of globalization; and the case for citizenship as social

                           This study is an attempt to locate the practice of consumption within more general strategies of social self-definition. The
                              essays in this volume are addressed to the understanding of consumption in terms of a larger matrix of social identity and
                              the cultural strategies connected with it.; The present volume focuses upon the relation between consumption and culturally
                              specific strategies for self-definition, both on an individual and a group basis. Many of the essays are explicit attempts
                              to deal with the complex articulation of modern commodities and "non-modern" modes of appropriation.; The papers reflect and
                              engage recent developments in anthropology such as the growing interest in personhood expressed in the numerous works of cultural
                              psychology, and an increasing emphasis on the re-envisioning of culture as continually constructed in socially differentiated
                              practice. As such, these papers deal with consumption as part of the practice of social identity and the construction of culturally
                              specific forms of life

                              iGod traces how the various belief systems about God have evolved into what exists in the present day, and then delves into
                                 the many questions about God that so many people have asked throughout history. Perhaps through this exploration we can finally
                                 begin to understand what God really is, what God wants, why we are here, and how we can create a better world, both for ourselves

                              The organization 'Genocide Watch' estimates that 100 million civilians around the globe have lost their lives as a result
                                 of genocide in only the past sixty years. Over the same period, the visual arts in the form of documentary footage has aided
                                 international efforts to document genocide and prosecute those responsible, but this book argues that fictional representation
                                 occupies an equally important and problematic place in the process of shaping minds on the subject. Edited by two of the leading
                                 experts in the field, The History of Genocide in Cinema analyzes fictional and semi-fictional portrayals of genocide, focusing
                                 on, amongst others, the repression of indigenous populations in Australia, the genocide of Native Americans in the 19th century,
                                 the Herero genocide, Armenia, the Holodomor (Stalin's policy of starvation in Ukraine), the Nazi Holocaust, Nanking and Darfur.
                                 Comprehensive and unique in its focus on fiction films, as opposed to documentaries, this is an essential resource for students
                                 and researchers in the fields of cultural history, holocaust studies and the history of film

                              The Lion and the Star not only offers an informed glimpse into the intricacies of daily German life but also confirms the
                                 continuing danger of making sweeping generalizations about German Jews and non-Jews. In the aftermath of World War II, many
                                 viewed the Third Reich as an aberration in German history and laid blame with Hitler and his followers. Since the 1960s, historians
                                 have widened their focus, implicating ""ordinary"" Germans in the demise of German Jewry. Jonathan Friedman addresses this
                                 issue by investigation everyday relations between German Jews and their Gentile neighbors. Friedman

                              This unique work opens a field of inquiry around place-based critiques of global capital as it focuses on the interactions
                                 between local issues and international financial flows. Framing their discussions around the concept of place-based imagination,
                                 the contributors examine such cases as indigenous movements against land degradation, ethnic pluralism and union organizing,
                                 ethnic diversity and the challenges of state and capital to cultural identity, and women's networks through non-governmental
                                 organizations. This ambitious study will be an invaluable resource and launching point for scholar

Jul 17, 2017            I appreciate how user friendly this website is. It's easy to find products, whether searching by category, specific product name, or even simply browsing. It's also easy to access reviews written by fellow consumers.                   Jul 27, 2017  I have ordered here once before and was so impressed with the process...browsing online, order, shipment, and delivery, that I will always come back here for future orders.
