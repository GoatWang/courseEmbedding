Coordinated Healthcare. Today.















Product

rn.d.s. brings Patients, Doctors and Nurses together. Its the All-in-One HIPAA compliant platform for coordinated care, patient assessments, real-time analytics on quality of care, voice calling and text messaging.



Available now for iPhone and Android
 
 






Improve Rounding Efficiency for Doctors
rn.d.s. was designed to make the complex schedule of a doctor more efficient and coordinated.
When arriving at a facility or floor, the doctor can use rn.d.s to begin rounding on their patients. They simply open the map of the facility and floor where they are seeing patients and click on the room number. A rounding page then appears overlaying the map with the name of the nurse, their picture, and a list of all other rooms they are caring for. Doctors can then send a rounds request, find that nurse’s specific location on the map, or directly message or call that particular nurse. We bring care teams together with ease, makes rounding more efficient and brings more personal clarity to clinical decisions.


Superior efficient rounding solution
Increased care team communication
In-app voice calling
Text messaging
Better job performance and satisfaction







Account setup is a one-time, simple process for Doctors

Empower Patients
With rn.d.s., patients know when their doctor is going to come by to see them. Patients provide real time feedback on their care team – ensuring their voice is heard – which contributes to a higher quality of care and superior patient experience.
Our geolocation feature allows patients to determine the exact location of their caregivers, and alerts them when the doctor is on the way, increasing admission and general caregiving efficiency. Daily Patient Experience and Satisfaction Assessments, effectively allows patients to “round” on the hospital and the providers caring for them, empowering the patient’s voice while they are in the hospital. This increased ability to be geographically plugged in to doctor and nursing rounds, and real-time assessments sent directly to the hospital leadership, empowers patients, provides for better two-way communication, reduces errors, and improves overall patient satisfaction.


Increased convenience and information
Daily satisfaction assessments
Improved quality of care and patient experience

Administrators are provided with real time visibility and analytics as to the quality of care provided at their facility.

Administrators can quickly address patient needs while the patient is still in the hospital with real-time notifications, and actionable analytics on a variety of patient care topics such as patient mobility, pain management and overall hospital patient satisfaction. Improved quality of care, reduction in errors, increased coordinated care and communication, reduced cost of care, and higher levels of patient satisfaction can result in higher HCAHPS scores. Our all-in-one app also reduces the cost for multiple technology solutions.

About RNDS:
Bueller RNDS (RNDS) is a highly innovative downtown Austin, Texas based, mHealth company focused on the development and sale of an app utilizing novel and proprietary software design for the hospital, rehab facilities and other institutions that utilize EMR systems. RNDS primary product, currently in the beta testing phase, will be used by physicians, nurses, other caregivers, patients and administrators. The app will function to provide the best patient care experience, measure and improve clinical performance, lower costs, provide analytics and improve revenues.Bueller RNDS was incorporated in June 2016 for the purpose of providing a vehicle to develop and implement the RNDS application. RNDS is a software product that is developed and owned by Bueller Rounds, Inc. which is a subsidiary of Bueller Innovation, LLC. Austin, TX. RNDS strategy initially is to fill a glaring need for physicians, nurses and patients to all come together to adequately treat patients in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner and provide  the highest quality of care. The Electronic Medical Record, despite its major advances in some areas of medical care, has fragmented the team of people that actually see and treat the patients at the bedside. RNDS has taken major steps in completing the development of its RNDS app to solve this issue. The RNDS app will solve this issue. It is designed to bring people together at the bedside, plain and simple. It is currently in beta testing with two major hospitals located in Austin, Tx. Upon funding, RNDS is in a position to commence commercializing its app and generate revenue  for  the  company.  COORDINATED   HEALTHCARE, TODAY.

      Description
    
RNDS is an app that brings doctors and nurses together on the floor of the hospital so they can actually see the patient…together. RNDS puts nurses on a map overlay of the patient care area so doctors can easily locate them.  RNDS also has a feature for patient satisfaction reports and patient reported outcome data that is followed real-time, empowering patients to have a voice in the delivery of the care they receive.
