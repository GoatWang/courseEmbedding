Bradford T Whitmore's Experience
Title: Board of Trustees Member
               Company: North Shore Country Day School
Job Details
               The North Shore Country Day School was founded in 1919 by a group of parents who wanted to provide their children with the quality of education found in eastern boarding schools. The school still serves the parents' original mission: to provide high-quality, coeducational, college preparatory education. Perry Dunlap Smith, chosen as the School's first headmaster, believed that North Shore Country Day School should not be a substitute for the family, but an extension of it, in helping children reach their full potential. North Shore Provides an academically rigorous environment based on the premise that the most effective and comprehensive learning takes place in small classes with a first-rate faculty. The School has over 500 students in Junior Kindergarten through Twelfth Grade.
