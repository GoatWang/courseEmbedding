WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. ("Corindus" or the "Company") [NYSE 
      MKT: CVRS], a leading developer of precision vascular robotics, today 
      announced that Mark Toland has been appointed Chief Executive Officer 
      and member of the Board of Directors, replacing David Handler who has 
      announced his resignation.
    


      Mr. Toland joins Corindus from Boston Scientific [NYSE: BSX], a global 
      medical technology leader with a significant focus on cardiovascular 
      solutions, where he most recently held the position of Senior Vice 
      President, Corporate Accounts & Global Healthcare Solutions. He brings 
      more than 20 years of operating experience in the cardiovascular medical 
      device industry to Corindus. Mr. Toland spent more than 18 years 
      at Boston Scientific where he led large divisional and corporate teams 
      responsible for U.S. commercial sales and operations across multiple 
      cardiovascular business segments, including Interventional Cardiology, 
      Peripheral, Structural Heart, and Electrophysiology.
    

      "Mark is a highly respected industry veteran with proven leadership 
      skills and an exceptional track record of growing organizations within 
      the interventional cardiovascular industry," said Jeffrey Lightcap, 
      Chairman of the Board of Directors of Corindus. "Mark’s deep cath lab 
      insights and strategic vision will be instrumental to leading Corindus 
      as we build upon our strong foundation and work to capture the 
      significant potential of robotics in the cath lab."
    

      Commenting on his appointment, Mark Toland said, "The global opportunity 
      for precision vascular robotics is tremendous. I am extremely impressed 
      with the Company’s skilled team and unique product offering within large 
      segments of the vascular markets. I am excited to join Corindus and look 
      forward to working with the healthcare community on enhancing patient 
      outcomes while reducing radiation exposure and ergonomic strain to 
      physicians and healthcare providers."
    

      Mr. Lightcap added, "On behalf of the entire Board of Directors and 
      everyone at Corindus, we thank David Handler for his contributions to 
      Corindus which have created a solid foundation for the Company’s future 
      success. Under David’s leadership, Corindus successfully brought the 
      CorPath System® through US regulatory approval and its early 
      commercialization. We wish David the best in his future endeavors."
    

About Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc.


Corindus 
      Vascular Robotics, Inc. is a global technology leader in 
      robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). The 
      company’s CorPath System is the first FDA-cleared medical device to 
      bring robotic-assisted precision to PCI procedures. During the 
      procedure, the interventional cardiologist sits at a radiation-shielded 
      cockpit to advance stents and guidewires with millimeter-by-millimeter 
      precision. The cockpit allows the physician greater control and the 
      freedom from wearing heavy lead protective equipment that causes 
      musculoskeletal injuries. With the CorPath System, Corindus Vascular 
      Robotics brings robotic precision to radial and complex PCI procedures 
      to help optimize clinical outcomes and minimize the costs associated 
      with complications of improper stent placement with manual PCI 
      procedures. Corindus stands behind its product with its unique $1,000 
      hospital credit "One Stent Program." For additional information, visit www.corindus.com, 
      and follow @CorindusInc.

Toland Brings Over 20 Years of Healthcare Industry Operating Experience to Corindus



WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE) – Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. [NYSE MKT: CVRS], a leading developer of precision vascular robotics, today announced that Mark Toland has been appointed Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors, replacing David Handler who has announced his resignation.
Mr. Toland joins Corindus from Boston Scientific [NYSE: BSX], a global medical technology leader with a significant focus on cardiovascular solutions, where he most recently held the position of Senior Vice President, Corporate Accounts & Global Healthcare Solutions. He brings more than 20 years of operating experience in the cardiovascular medical device industry to Corindus. Mr. Toland spent more than 18 years at Boston Scientific where he led large divisional and corporate teams responsible for U.S. commercial sales and operations across multiple cardiovascular business segments, including Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral, Structural Heart, and Electrophysiology.
"Mark is a highly respected industry veteran with proven leadership skills and an exceptional track record of growing organizations within the interventional cardiovascular industry," said Jeffrey Lightcap, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Corindus. "Mark’s deep cath lab insights and strategic vision will be instrumental to leading Corindus as we build upon our strong foundation and work to capture the significant potential of robotics in the cath lab."
Commenting on his appointment, Mark Toland said, "The global opportunity for precision vascular robotics is tremendous. I am extremely impressed with the Company’s skilled team and unique product offering within large segments of the vascular markets. I am excited to join Corindus and look forward to working with the healthcare community on enhancing patient outcomes while reducing radiation exposure and ergonomic strain to physicians and healthcare providers."
Mr. Lightcap added, "On behalf of the entire Board of Directors and everyone at Corindus, we thank David Handler for his contributions to Corindus which have created a solid foundation for the Company’s future success. Under David’s leadership, Corindus successfully brought the CorPath System® through US regulatory approval and its early commercialization. We wish David the best in his future endeavors."
 


About Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc.
Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. is a global technology leader in robotic-assisted vascular interventions. The company's CorPath System is the first FDA-cleared medical device to bring robotic precision to interventional procedures. During the procedure, the interventional cardiologist sits at a radiation-shielded workstation to advance guide catheters, stents, and guidewires with millimeter-by-millimeter precision. The workstation allows the physician greater control and the freedom from wearing heavy lead protective equipment that causes musculoskeletal injuries. With the CorPath System, Corindus Vascular Robotics brings robotic precision to interventional procedures to help optimize clinical outcomes and minimize the costs associated with complications of improper stent placement during manual procedures. Corindus stands behind its product with its unique $1,000 hospital credit "One Stent Program."
