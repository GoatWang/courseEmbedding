Queen of the South Season 2 Episode 7 Review: El Precio De La Fe

	Everything comes with a price. Mercy, faith, loyalty. 

	None of it came for free on Queen of the South Season 2 Episode 7.




	Teresa’s bold move to take the metric ton of cocaine from El Santo moved her up in the pecking order of Camila’s organization.


Camila: So why did you do it?Teresa: Because now you have a choice, with nothing you don't. It was a gamble. I made it alone. Camila: Well done, Teresa.


 Permalink: Well done, Teresa.





	The cards were still being dealt with this particular gamble, and the stakes were high. Camila still had no way to distribute that much product, although she showed no signs of giving up her hand. 

	But with every move the game became more dangerous. 

	Even as Teresa was being praised for her daring decisions, James was paying the price for his. 


Camila: You're making judgement calls now?James: Teresa makes them, you pat her on the back. I make them, I'm insubordinate. 


 Permalink: Teresa makes them, you pat her on the back. I make them, I'm insubordinate.





	When they left for Bolivia, James was unquestionably Camila’s right hand man, but his decision to spare Guero after the man save his life, put him on the outs with his boss. 

	And it was difficult to blame Camila for being upset. There’s no denying that Guero is a liability. The DEA is on his trail and he’s got a history of playing ball with them. 

	If the Feds picked up Guero, would he turn on Camila and Teresa? I honestly don’t know the answer to that. 

	As Camila pointed out to Teresa in this Queen of the South quote…


 If you want to succeed as a businesswoman, Teresa, you have to learn how to control your weaknesses before somebody else exploits them and costs you your life. 
Camila


 Permalink: If you want to succeed as a businesswoman, Teresa, you have to learn how to control your...





	That left me wondering if the man Teresa shot after he left her bed in Queen of the South Season 2 Episode 1 was indeed, Guero, because little by little, Teresa is taking Camila’s lessons to heart. 




	Camila’s strategy of sending the charm to Isabela was genius. Epifanio sent her the cash she needed to buy time with El Santo. 

	But he also murdered two of his main distributors who were about to work with Camila. It certainly sent a message but didn’t it harm Epifanio’s business just as much as Camila’s?

	What I appreciated most was Epifanio taking Isabela to his childhood farm and explaining how the Crocodile murdered her grandparents. 


 I got into this life so that you wouldn't have to come home and see your mother and father hanging from a tree. I had no choice. You do. 
Epifanio


 Permalink: I got into this life so that you wouldn't have to come home and see your mother and father...





	Isabela has been far too sheltered for far too long, but she wasn’t wrong. Her parents business is her own crocodile, and I have little doubt that it will eventually turn and bite her. 

	And did anyone else enjoy the irony of Teresa worrying that a video game was too violent, given the world in which she lives?




	I also really enjoyed seeing Kelly Anne again, although I question the DEA’s tactics with her. 

	Was showing her the horribly graphic photos of the people Camila Vargas has supposedly murdered really supposed to make her leave her rich husband and turn over evidence on a drug cartel?

	The way I saw it, those photos were even more of a reason for her to keep her mouth shut. 

	If Kelly Anne was smart, she would have gone to Cole and told him what happened, but strategic thinking may not be high on the list of Kelly Anne’s gifts. 

	However, I did find it amusing that it wasn’t the murder and mayhem that had her questioning her life choices, it was whether her husband was having an affair with Camila. 


Kelly Anne: We all kind of gave up our lives for the fairy tale but the fairy tale is bullshit.Teresa: Why are you telling me all of this? Kelly Anne: I'm a notorious over sharer. I just wanted you to know that we ain't perfect. There's a lot of skeletons in these walk in closets. Teresa: What's yours?Kelly Anne: My skeletons? How much time do you have? I think your boss Camila is sleeping with my husband. 


 Permalink: My skeleton? How much time do you have? I think your boss Camila is sleeping with my husband.





	I was hoping that Kelly Anne was going to tell Teresa about her visit from the DEA, but that obviously wasn’t on the agenda. 

	I also question why Teresa didn’t tell Camila the truth about Kelly Anne’s motives. I doubt Camila would be embarrassed by such a thing. It felt like information she should have and I’m curious why Teresa held it back. 

	But Camila’s biggest issue is her war with Epifanio. 


 Yes, thank you so much for the payment, but I'm not shutting down. If you want your metric ton, you're welcomed to come and pry it from my cold, dead, hands. 
Camila


 Permalink: Yes, thank you so much for the payment, but I'm not shutting down. If you want your metric...





	If that’s not Epifanio’s plan, it’s definitely Colonel Cortez’s. 




	Now that Epifanio has teamed up with the DEA on the task force, he’s going to bring this war right to Camila’s doorstep, and he’s got some serious reinforcements. 

	Even someone as smart and conniving as Camila Vargas will have to up her game.

	Check back next week for my review of Queen of the South season 2 episode 8, and if you just can’t get enough, you can watch Queen of the South online here at TV Fanatic.

Character bio
Actor bio




Teresa Mendoza is a poor young woman from the “barrio” of Jalisco, Mexico who found a way to rise above her hopeless conditions—first by falling in love with a successful member of a drug cartel, then eventually by creating her own powerful drug empire and becoming one of the wealthiest women in the world.
Learn More About Teresa Mendoza

She learns the hard way that she can only depend on herself and stay one step ahead of everyone else if she wants to stay alive. As her desperation morphs into determination, Teresa’s journey to becoming the Queen of the South begins. 

In her television debut, Alice Braga stars as Teresa Mendoza in USA Network’s new drama, QUEEN OF THE SOUTH.  This adaptation of Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s best-selling novel, La Reina Del Sur, follows Teresa’s journey as she learns the tools of the trade and positions herself as the leader of the very drug cartel that had her on the run.

The Brazilian born actress received critical and international recognition for her stirring performance in “City of God,” which helped catapult the film to multiple Golden Globe® and Oscar®nominations.  A multiple-award winning actress, Braga received best actress awards at Miami International Film Festival, International Film Festival in Rio de Janeiro and Verona Love Screens Film Festival for he role in “Lower City”; at Brazilian Film Festival of Toronto for “The Milky Way;” at Paulinia Festival for “Blindness;” and at Punta del Este Film Festival for “Cabeça a Prêmio.”
Next, Braga will be seen in Kieran-Darcy Smith’s “By Way of Helena” co-starring opposite Woody Harrelson and Liam Hemsworth.  She will also appear in Stuart Hazeldine’s “The Shack,” alongside Sam Worthington, Octavia Spencer and Tim McGraw.  Braga was last seen in the Neill Blomkamp’s futuristic drama, “Elysium,” opposite Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley.   Additional recent film credits include Walter Salles’ “On the Road” alongside Kristen Stewart, Kirsten Dunst, Amy Adams and Garrett Hedlund and based on the book by Jack Kerouac; Mikael Hafstrom’s thriller “The Rite” opposite Anthony Hopkins; Miguel Sapochnik’s thriller “Repo Men” opposite Jude Law and Forest Whitaker; as well as Nimrod Antal’s science fiction film “Predators” opposite Adrien Brody.
In 2008, Braga had three films. “Blindness” in which she re-teamed with director Fernando Meirelles and starred opposite Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo; as well as David Mamet's “Redbelt” which followed the life of a Jiu-jitsu master, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor and co-starring Emily Mortimer; and finally Wayne Kramer's film “Crossing Over,” in an ensemble cast led by Sean Penn and Harrison Ford.  Prior to this, Braga starred in the blockbuster success film, “I Am Legend,” opposite Will Smith.
Other film credits include Heitor Dahlia’s “Drained” (O Cheiro do Ralo) opposite Selton Mello; Eric Eason’s “Journey to the End of the Night,” featuring Mos Def and Brendan Fraser; Carlos Bolado’s “Only God Knows” (Sólo Dios Sabe), opposite Diego Luna; as well as the riveting drama “Lower City” (Cidade Baixa) about the dangers of a love triangle.  For her performance, A.O. Scott of the New York Times hailed Braga as “one of the most forthrightly and powerfully sexual screen actresses in the world.”
Braga is fluent in Portuguese, Spanish and English.

Actor bio




Teresa Mendoza is a poor young woman from the “barrio” of Jalisco, Mexico who found a way to rise above her hopeless conditions—first by falling in love with a successful member of a drug cartel, then eventually by creating her own powerful drug empire and becoming one of the wealthiest women in the world.
Learn More About Teresa Mendoza

She learns the hard way that she can only depend on herself and stay one step ahead of everyone else if she wants to stay alive. As her desperation morphs into determination, Teresa’s journey to becoming the Queen of the South begins. 

In her television debut, Alice Braga stars as Teresa Mendoza in USA Network’s new drama, QUEEN OF THE SOUTH.  This adaptation of Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s best-selling novel, La Reina Del Sur, follows Teresa’s journey as she learns the tools of the trade and positions herself as the leader of the very drug cartel that had her on the run.

Meanwhile, Braga recently shared her experience of being the lead character in the series.Previously on "Queen of the South" season 2, Teresa earned her ranks with her boss, Camila Vargas (Veronica Falcon). She sabotaged the business of other drug lords by stealing their stash and gave Camila's cartel a boost. She also escaped from the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) noses and got James (Peter Gadiot) away from the border vigilantes in Texas.In the next episode of "Queen of the South" season 2, Teresa will expand Camila's cartel with a new supplier. Along with James and Guero (Jon-Michael Ecker), Teresa will look to make business with El Santo, a dangerous and secretive narco-cult leader in Bolivia.Braga, who is a Brazil native, shared with Daily News how she felt about her character."I loved the core of the character, what she represented and what her journey was," the actress said, while also sharing that she fell in love with Teresa after reading the best-selling book — authored by Arturo Pérez-Reverte — which the series was adapted from.Given the crime-filled background of her character, Braga admitted that the biggest challenge for her is to maintain the humanity of her character for the viewers of the show to relate to."The biggest challenge is keeping the core alive and grounding it, humanizing it. Not to be the good guy or the bad guy, but humanizing it to be truthful," she said.On the topic of the show featuring the stereotypes about Mexicans, Braga explained that she just continues to find the balance between the showrunners and the audience."I keep trying to be aligned ... with people who are in charge of creating the show, saying: 'We should not glamorize (violence).' ... Even though it's hard ... because you want to please the audience with the action," Braga revealed.Watch "Queen of the South" season 2 every Thursday night at 10 p.m. EDT on USA.

The
                              origin of root and herb sorcery is
                              unknown, but the ancient Romans, Greeks,
                              Celts, Druids, Arabs, Egyptians, Chinese,
                              Africans, Indians and others, knew of the
                              magical powers of roots, barks, herbs,
                              plants, woods and berries. Many herbs are
                              mentioned in the Bible. Man has carried
                              roots and herbs as amulets and talismans
                              for protection against evil, and many
                              believe they can heal, bring good fortune,
                              arouse a lover, bring back a wandering
                              husband or wife, and make wishes come
                              true. Remember, there are many different
                              spells for most herbs, and each root or
                              herb can be used for may various purposes,
                              all of which cannot even begin to be
                              mentioned here.

                              immediately upon receiving and are mailed

                              valuable and my time is limited.  In order for me to
                              answer your personal letters and give you
                              personal advice, please send a
                              stamped, self-addressed envelope. Because
                              of the many requests I have been receiving
                              for special petitions, I have instituted a
                              special Novena for you.  If you care to
                              participate along with others, please
                              write your request or problem a clean
                              plain piece of white paper in your own
                              hand.  Also, your birthdate. 
                              I will then place it on my personal altar
                              before my perpetually burning Novena candle
                              and pray along with you in my daily
                              devotions.  This perpetual Novena
                              candle was lit by me by "drawing down the
                              sun" on the vernal
















                              equinox and it is kept perpetually
                              burning.  This perpetual Novena
                              candle was
















                              first lit and dedicated to the people who
                              have asked my help.  I will not accept harmful
                              requests.  A donation  per
                              request will be accepted to help cover the high cost
                              of candles. Please write and let me know
                              when your request has been granted or
                              your problem has been resolved ,  so
                              I may remove your name and make room for
                              others.
