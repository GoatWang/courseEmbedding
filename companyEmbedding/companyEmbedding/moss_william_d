William D. MOSS


JAMES MOSS. - While the subject of this sketch was not born in this
county, still the major part of his life has been spent here and we may
practically say that he is a product of the county, and when that is said
we are bound to add that he is a product of which the county may well be
proud, because he is active in the advancement of the interests of the
same and has ever displayed excellent ability and been dominated with wisdom
while his personality of integrity and sound principles is manifest to
all, and he is one of the substantial and leading citizens of the county
to-day.
James Moss was born in Wapellow county, Iowa, on November 29, 1854,
being the son of William and Sarah (Walker) Moss. In the year 1864 the
parents were led by the glowing reports from the west land to gather their
substance together, and take the arduous and weary journey across the plains
and mountains, where they were beset with all kinds of hardships and dangers,
yet completing their pilgrimage in safety, when they landed the same fall
in the Grande Ronde valley. A homestead was taken at once, one and one-half
miles north from Island City, and there all hands went to work to subdue
the sod for the crops to sustain and to erect buildings for their own shelter.
Prosperity attended their well directed efforts, and the parents are still
living on the home place, enjoying the fruits of their labor. Our subject
attended the public school in the old log school house in the district,
and in those primitive surroundings, secured the education that assisted
his father on the farm and later went with stock drives to Nevada, being
occupied thus until 1879. At this date, he turned his attention to freighting
from Umatilla Landing to the mines in the Boise Basin, continuing the same
also for two years while the railroad was building. In 1884 he bought eighty
acres of land, adding to it from time to time until now he owns two hundred
and eight acres of fine land, two and one-fourth miles from Alicel. This
is well improved nad skillfully tilled. Mr. Moss being one of the most
progressive agriculturists of the entire county. He has a fine residence,
good outbuildings, and all conveniences for handling his large farm in
first class shape, and the entire premises present to the eye of inspection
good care, thrift and good taste. He has an orchard of one hundred and
twenty-five trees, and on the balance of the land he raises the cereals.
On March 1, 1885, occurred the marriage of Mr. Moss and Miss Jennie,
daughter of John and Eliza (Woodell) Wallsinger, pioneers to the Grande
ronde valley in 1862. To this happy union have been born three children,
Isis, Lema, Irwin, all at home. Mrs. Moss was born in the county, near
Cove. Mr. Moss is and has been clerk and school director since his residence
in the district. He is a member of the I.O.O.F., Lodge No. 16, of Lagrande.
Mr. Moss is one of those men who takes a proper interest in the affairs
of government, but nevertheless, does not press forward for personal preferment,
while he forms part of that substantial class which is the boast and pride
of every well regulated community, He is esteemed and respected by his
neighbors and fellows and is a worthy, progressive and inteliggent citizen
of our county.

WILLARD A. MOSS. - To the gentleman whose name initiates this paragraph
we are constrained by force of right to accord a representation in this
volume, since he is a product of Union county, and all of his life has
been spent here in honest endeavor for the welfare of the same, while also
prosecuting his business enterprises with a skill and ability that stamp
him as one of the potent factors of our county, and surely one of its successful
men, while he has always held himself under the influences of a sagacity
and wisdom that have led him in the path of uprightness and given him the
meed of the industrious and the competence of the faithful.
In the year 1867 he was born in Island City, being the son of William
D. Moss, and here also he obtained from the common schools the education
that was his fortification for the battle of life, which he entered upon
at the early age of eighteen, his first venture being to enter into partnership
with is father. Together they operated the farm of the latter and continued
thus for some time.
In the year 1891 Mr. Moss married Miss Mollie A., daughter of D.A. and
Nancy McAlister, and two children have been born to them; Muriel, born
in July, 1894; and Guy, born in May, 1898. Politically Mr. Moss is with
the Democratic party, and he has always taken an active interest in these
matters and has labored faithfully for the welfare of the county. He is
also affiliated with the M.W. of A., and in this relation, as all the others
of his life, he is highly esteemed and is the recipient of the confidence
and respect of his fellows.

WILLIAM D. MOSS. - One of the leading stockmen and farmers of Grande
Ronde valley is the subject of this sketch, a venerable and highly respected
pioneer of this country, who has labord here with sagacity and assiduity
for over one-third of a century and has been a potent factor in changing
the wilds of nature into the prosperous county of to-day, while he has
ever maintained an upright demeanor, an untarnished reputation and placed
an example worthy to be followed by all who would emulate noble virtues
and moral worth.
William D. Moss was born in Morgan county, Illinois, on December 15,
1828. In 1835 his father, Henry Mos, removed to Wapellow county, Iowa,
where he became one of the prosperous farmers of the section. The school
facilities of the region were very meager and so our subject had the msifortune
to be able to attend but three months in all his boyhood days: however,
this was amended by careful personal research in subjequent years. He remained
with his father until he had reached the age of twenty-four years and then
rented land and worked out in the neighborhood until 1864, then fitted
himself for the overland trip to the west. Ox teams were the popular motive
power for traveling then and with these he journeyed each day toward the
setting sun, being with the U. Neels train. When this body reached the
mining fields of Utah nearly all of the emigrants scattered into the mineral
regions and five families were left to join another train and make their
way to the Grande Ronde valley. It was on August 12, of the same year,
that they arrived and our subject immediately, took up a homestead where
he now resides, one and one-half miles north from Island city. His exchequer
was lined with a ten-cent scrip when he settled on the homestead and from
that time forward, whatever he gained was from the soil and resources of
Union county. Oursubject went to work for neighbors five days in the week,
and spent one day each week in opening up his farm, having six oxen and
six cows. His wisdom was manifested in this as he was able to support his
family and open his farm, and in three years, he had the satisfaction of
looking over two eighties of cultivated land that belonged to him. This
was a commendable record and demonstrates the ability of our subject. In
1873 he took up a timber claim.
In 1852 Mr. Moss married Miss Sarah, daughter of William and Rebecca
(Meadows) Walker, of Van Buren county,Iowa, and from that day to this she
has been steadfast and faithful, being a priceless helpmate during all
his labors and hardships, and assisting in the accomplishment of his praise
worthy labors. To this worthy couple eight children have been born, six
of whom are living, as follows: amelia J., wife of Andrew J. Holman, living
in Lincoln county, Washington; James P., married to Martha J. Walsinger,
of Grande Ronde valley; John W., Henry: Willis A. and Willard A., twins,
the former married to Mary Sims, and the latter to Mollie McAlister, and
both living in the Grande Ronde valley. John and Henry are living with
their parents. In politics our subject is allied with the Democrats and
for three years he has constantly held the office of school director. Our
subject and his wife are members of the Methodist church south, and they
are faithful supporters of their doctrine and loyal to the tenets of their
faith, while their lives are the best argument for the realities of Christianity,
ever exemplifying the graces of the teachings of the One whom they claim
as Savior.
