Seen On Screen TV, Inc. (OTCQB: SONT) -- Launches New Product, a Pocket Battery Charger and Car Battery Jumper, the Charge'n Jump

EVERETT, WA--(Marketwired - Feb 10, 2016) -  Seen On Screen TV, Inc. (OTCQB: SONT) went live online today with its latest product, a pocket sized, battery powered unit that can charge almost any mobile device, but its best feature is that it will jump start a car with a rundown battery. The e-commerce site for the Charge'n Jump was developed by VoiceFlix, Inc. It is located at Charge'n Jump.com and the units are selling for $59.99.
George Jarjour, COO of Seen on Screen TV, Inc., remarked, "A few months ago, when this product was just a sample and we had not yet committed to it, I accidentally left my car lights on all day while I was at work and my car would not start after work because the battery was flat. I went back in the office and got one charge'n Jump, plugged it into my car and was delighted when it worked exactly as advertised. This is a very high quality product that we are selling at a very competitive price."
Antoine Jarjour, CEO of Seen on Screen TV, said, "The Charge'n Jump is a fine product that we have used ourselves, and it performs its job admirably. We take it to trade shows and it keeps our phones and laptops charged all day with no problem. This is an excellent device that has become necessary to keep all our portable devices charged and ready for use."

Seen On Screen TV, Inc. (OTCQB: SONT) Seeks New Product Lines and International Sales OutletsOctober 28, 2015 |  About: 
SONT  +0%




EVERETT, WA--(Marketwired - Oct 28, 2015) -  Seen On Screen TV, Inc. (OTCQB: SONT) announces today that it has begun a major new effort to secure new products and product lines. This venture is international in scope, and is the first time the company has sought new outlets for products in Africa.
Antoine Jarjour, CEO of Seen on Screen said, "We are in the process of rolling out a new, more aggressive plan to grow sales and advertise more widely. We are always on the lookout for new products, which are the lifeblood of our company, but we also have to clear inventory. Our new African connections promise to help us with that, and we have some powerful new sources for interesting new products. The market has changed in the last few years, and we are determined to change with it." 
George Jarjour, Chief Operating Officer of Seen on Screen, said "This is our first trip to Africa. The possibilities are exciting, as we have appointments with contacts in Ethiopia and Dubai as well as Lebanon and Europe."
