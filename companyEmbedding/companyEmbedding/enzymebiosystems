EnzymeBioSystems: A Promotion Best Left Untouched - EnzymeBioSystems (OTCMKTS:ENZB-OLD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»EnzymeBioSystems: A Promotion Best Left UntouchedMar.17.15 | About: EnzymeBioSystems (ENZB) Hunter Straus Long-term horizon, Growth, long/short equitySummaryEnzymeBioSystems' financials appear to be inadequate to support the company's goals.About 70% of the company's stock is owned by officers, directors, and the single-largest shareholder.The company has spent only $89,808 in research & development, and has not generated any revenue since inception.The company's corporate HQ appears to be a UPS store.Background
EnzymeBioSystems (OTCQB:ENZB) was recently featured on a promotional website, and through snail-mail advertisements from the Intelligent Investor Report. While the landing page has since been taken down, it's important to note that the promotional advertisement claimed that the company's product is a potential cure for cancer, among other things. Given the substantial insider ownership, nature of the company's financials, and management's history, it is my opinion that investors would be wise to avoid investing in the common stock of EnzymeBioSystems.
Business
From the company's investor presentation:
EnzymeBioSystems ("ENZB"), a Nevada corporation, was founded on June 26, 2009, for the purpose of utilizing enzyme technologies to develop commercial solutions for a broad range of applications within the specialty chemical industry. Enzymes can be categorized as "enzyme inhibitors" and "enzyme activators." Enzyme inhibi-tors are molecules that bind to enzymes and decrease their activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Enzyme activators are molecules that bind to en-zymes and increase their activity. These molecules are often involved in the alloste-ric [defined as having to do with a protein with a structure that is altered reversibly by a small molecule so that its original function is modified] regulation of enzymes in the control of metabolism. Both enzyme inhibitors and enzyme activators are currently used by many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in research and development of new drug compounds.
The description is pretty ambiguous - it doesn't really tell us what the company does, it only tells us what the company was founded for - has there been any progress on research since 2009? It doesn't say. There is no mention of the company's research progress and, product development, potential customers or market size. The long description of "enzyme inhibitors" and "enzyme activators only adds to the confusion. I want to know why, as a potential investor, I should be interested in the company. How can I expect a return on my investment?

Beyond the confusing business description, the company's financials don't do much to clarify things. If we have a detailed look at ENZB's financial statements, it's apparent that the company's financial situation is unable to support such a specialized business.
Beyond these issues, the address listed on the company's SEC filings as its Principal Executive offices appears to be a UPS store in Las Vegas.
Financials
ENZB's most recent 10-Q filed on February 3, 2015 shows that the company has $344,942 in cash (the only asset class listed in the balance sheet), no history of revenue, and an accumulated deficit of about $925,000. In its income statement, the only operating expenses are listed as "general and administrative" at $53,659, and nothing was spent on "research & development." In the six months ended December 31, 2014, the company's operations used $71,447 in cash. Given its cash holdings of $344,932, it would seem that at the current cash burn rate, the company has time, but the amount spent seems inconsistent with the claims that are made in the promotion of its stock. It seems highly unlikely that the amount of cash spent is sufficient to pay for a facility, employees, test materials and equipment to produce such a promising product, and the lack of any spending on "research & development" recently shows that the company has not been actively working on much of anything.
Furthermore, if ENZB's only asset is cash, it implies that it doesn't even have any other property - I can understand renting a facility, but surely there must be some equipment or test samples if I am to be convinced that the company is actively performing research.
In fact, if we look at the 10-Q filed on November 3, 2014, we can see in the income statement that from the company's inception on June 26, 2009 through September 31, 2014, the company has spent only $89,808 on research & development and $81,000 on salaries. After over five years, it seems that very few resources have been dedicated towards progress on any kind of research.

Going Concern and Dilution
The company's auditors have also issued a going concern opinion, which I have copied from the company's most recent 10-Q:

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN
These condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2014, the Company has not recognized any revenues and has accumulated operating losses of approximately $924,738 since inception. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. Management plans to raise equity capital to finance the operating and capital requirements of the Company. Amounts raised will be used to further development of the Company's products, to provide financing for marketing and promotion, to secure additional property and equipment, and for other working capital purposes. While the Company is putting forth its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.

The first point in bold is pretty important - it plainly states that management plans to issue shares in order to raise additional funding, and isn't even considering looking for a loan. I'd at least like to see management take a stake by loaning the company money in the form of a convertible bond, but this is not mentioned here. The company's Liquidity and Capital Resources note reads:
The Company is authorized to issue 195,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock and 5,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value preferred stock. As of December 31, 2014, the Company has 33,283,587 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and 5,000,000 of its Series A Preferred Shares issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had current assets of $344,932 and current liabilities of $7,170.

So ENZB can dilute the current common share pool by about 6.5 times in order to raise cash - given that the company has spent hardly any money at all on research, it seems that major dilution is inevitable.
Insider Ownership
ENZB's most recent 10-K states:
As of October 13, 2014, our officers, directors and single largest shareholder owned approximately 70% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our officers and largest shareholder will have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including...
At the time of the filing, the company listed its employee count at three officers and two directors, none of whom have any notable experience managing a business in the pharmaceutical industry.
Website and investor presentation
The company's website reads like large advertisement for it stock (instead of its products), and dedicates a substantial amount of space to describing that management is well suited to run the company. Indeed, there is little which describes in detail what ENZB does, only that it has "Proven Management and Track Record" The 10-page investor presentation is not much better - it is undated, and has very little meaningful information. On the second page, the company lists the "highlights" of the presentation as follows:



Developed antitumorantibiotic
In vivo animal studies in progress, showing dramatic tumor reduction results
Large market potential for antitumor antibiotics
Strong upside potential for Company and its stock, and outright purchase of the Company
Experienced, industry specific management team


ENZB's claims of progress are supported by a few blurry pictures of rats with tumors that have supposedly been reduced by the company's products, but there is no information that would tell me that supports massive upside or the possibility of a buyout. Additionally, only two members of the management team have information on them, none of which suggests that they have a history of successfully developing, producing, and selling pharmaceutical products.

Conclusion
Given the company's financials and experience, it seems highly unlikely that its stated goals are achievable. ENZB simply does not have the resources available to carry out the objectives that are advertised. Beyond the assets required, the company has also spent very little, and has not invested in R&D in quite some time. On top of that, there is substantial insider ownership, and ENZB's accounting firm noted that there is substantial doubt that the company will be able to continue as a going concern.
Beyond the woeful cash situation, ENZB has no source of available funding beyond issuing equity - I would not be surprised at all if there is a major share offering or a sizeable private placement to a third-party in the near future. As icing on the cake, the company's corporate HQ has the same address as a UPS store, which gives me substantial doubt that it operates any facilities at all. If you happened to see the company's investor presentation or the landing page and are considering investing in ENZB common stock, don't believe the hype - have a look at the company's filings - they tell a far more realistic picture than what is presented on the surface.
