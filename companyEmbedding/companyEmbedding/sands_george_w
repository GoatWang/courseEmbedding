Rated 5 out of 5 by MaeE Nice, fit well
 The fabric of these pants is very nice for denim, light wt and no metal or uneccessary bling. I do wish they had pockets but I will enjoy them as they are. I wish he would bring more colors...Thanks and Keep bringin us George Simonton fashions..please

Rated 5 out of 5 by Renee999 Nice!
 There's an expensive looking sheen to the fabric, and it lays beautifully. I carrry weight around middle and wear size 12-14. Medium fit like a dream. Flattering.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Beautiful hair Slimming
 Perfect for pear shape gals for sure. I found it to fit true to size. I wish QVC had more real boot cut pants. Slim leg pants does not look good on all shapes. George please bring this back in more colors.

Rated 5 out of 5 by DTMEDIC LOVE THESE PANTS
 I have both the British Tan and the Denim...would love to have a chocolate brown and black pair. They are SO comfortable and SO flattering. I'm a big gal (2X) and these are probably the most flattering slacks I own...PLEASE George...bring some more colors in these.

Rated 2 out of 5 by jellicledoc IF YOU HAVE LUMPS ANYWHERE SAVE YOUR MONEY!
 The denim in this was spectacular! So I came back for the white. I am a Simonton gal to be sure. Why would he of all people, not recognize the need to help conceal where it's needed? And he's not the only designer who won't line. Why not spend a little extra to do that in the lighter colored pants, especially in the larger sizes? Don't think I'm the only one with lumpy thighs. Many larger sized women have that on their thighs and rear ends.(I imagine smaller folks do, too, in some cases.) Lining would be a good idea in a white pant whether or not you have lumps! I'd sure pay more for a quality garment that diminishes flaws. Heck, I'd give you the kids if you erase the flaws completely. But, failing that, line the darned things! I gave it 2 stars because of the thin fabric. I would recommend these to my skinny friends.

Product Description▼▲
George W. Bush has brought the question of religion back into American political life in a way that it has not been for decades. From the 2000 election through the challenges America has faced in the wake of September 11, Bush's personal faith-and his conviction about the importance of religion in our national life-have won him lasting admiration from the right, while attracting fury and scorn from the left. Now presidential scholar Paul Kengor, the author of the acclaimed God and Ronald Regan, reconstructs the spiritual journey that carried George W. Bush to the White House-from the death of his sister, which helped to shape his character, to the conversion experience that changed his life. Matching detailed new research with thoughtful analysis, this is the definitive look at the spiritual life of this American president.

Publisher's Description▼▲
George W. Bush has brought the question of religion back into American political life in a way that it has not been for decades. From the 2000 election through the challenges America has faced in the wake of September 11, Bush's personal faith -- and his conviction about the importance of religion in our national life -- have won him lasting admiration from the right, while attracting fury and scorn from the left.Now presidential scholar Paul Kengor, the author of the acclaimed God and Ronald Reagan, reconstructs the spiritual journey that carried George W. Bush to the White House -- from the death of his sister, which helped to shape his character, to the conversion experience that changed his life. Matching detailed new research with thoughtful analysis, God and George W. Bush is the definitive look at the spiritual life of this American president.


Author Bio▼▲
