Art- Painting


Play all


        It was hard to sell my painting because I felt so attached to them. Then my art teacher gave me some great advice, she said, "its not the finished piece you should be attached to its the process that it took to get there" So I thought what a better way to remember the process then by recording it? Thinking of new things to paint is always the hardest, if you have some suggestions I would love to hear them!
