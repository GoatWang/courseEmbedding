 ReCon is a proven gravity retaining wall system and product of choice for many sites with difficult challenges. With the base dimension covering 5 1/3 square feet, architects are attracted to the natural stone appearance and the larger scale that is physically impossible to achieve with the smaller products available in the marketplace today. Engineers who design with ReCon's large retaining wall block system also like the product and are comfortable with the mass, density and stabile footprint built into each of the ReCon retaining wall units.

Lifting Devise: lifting insert loop
Turing Radius: Approximately 15 feet (varies with wall height)
Retaining Wall Batter: 3.6 degrees automatically built into the system.  Can be adjusted to 7.2 degrees with the use of field-installed spacers.
Tall Gravity Retaining Walls
Unique tongue-and-grove lock-and-placement design, combined with massive size and weight, permits retaining wall heights up to 17 ft. 4 in. without reinforcing geogrid.  Eliminates the time and cost associated with excavation and soil replacement when reinforcing geogrid is required.
Significantly taller ReCon Walls can be built by incorporating geogrid, setback or tiers.
Durability
Made of wet-cast, air-entrained concrete with a minimum psi of 4,000. The durability required in environments prone to the challenges of freeze/thaw cycle, road salts or brackish water.
Faster Installation
Concrete Block Walls from ReCon can be constructed quickly using equipment generally available to contractors, maximizing productivity and minimizing manual labor.  No mortar, no pins.
Engineered and Tested
A ReCon Retaining Wall can be professionally engineered and designed for wall performance that is generally unavailable for natural stone walls.
Customized Design and Aesthetics
The rustic rock finish prevents repetition in the overall wall pattern.  Stains are readily available and easily applied in the field after installation to achieve a customized color that will last for years to come.
Block comes in multiple depths to optimize efficiency by providing the mass when required or eliminating it when not required to save material and freight cost.
Tapered block design allows both inside and outside 90 degree corners or curves.
Caps or special top units that allow greenscape within four inches of the finished wall face are available.
ReCon CAD Details

          Installation        


Ease of Installation
One of the biggest advantages of the big block system is the increased labor production rate. The most experienced wall contractors have indicated that they can achieve rates from 150 to 200 sq. ft. of installed wall per man per day on most project sites. In some cases, contractors have achieved up to 250 sq. ft. of installed wall per man per day.
ReCon is installed using equipment many contractors have on most commercial retaining wall job sites. Skid steers, back hoes and front end loaders have all been used to locate and place ReCon units which translates into increased efficiencies because moving equipment is not subject to human fatigue. ReCon walls are usually constructed with a smaller crew than projects requiring physical handling of wall basic components.
For installation recommendations, please see Section 3.5 Unit Installation of the ReCon Specification which can be found in the download section above.

 Legacy Series  


 


Legacy Series





 Reminiscent of a rustic French pattern this new paver series adds character and interest to your expansive outdoor living space.  Composed of four different sizes, the Versailles pattern can be used wherever you desire an interesting pattern under foot.  Legacy is sold in full (128 sq. ft.) and half cubes (64 sq. ft.) only.  
All four sizes are packaged on the same pallet for ease of estimating and ordering.  Legacy is available in three colors: Milky Way, Hampton Green, and Sterling Blend.
Legacy is for pedestrian traffic only.  A paver saver or comparable product should be used when compacting the Boardwalk Series.
Reading Rock paver products are manufactured to meet industry standards and are thus de-icing salt resistant;  however, caution should be used when applying de-icing chemicals and excessive use should always be avoided as it may cause damage to the paver surface.  Additionally, Reading Rock recommends using calcium based products or rock salt only.  Do not use magnesium based products as they are very aggressive and may cause damage to the paver surface.
