The return of Paul Marshall

							Putting aside political ambitions, a co-founder comes back to help revive Marshall Wace.
						








Page 1 of 2


By Barry
    Cohen

    From his penthouse office in central London, Paul Marshall has
    a bird’s eye view: To the west, he sees the Houses
    of Parliament, a wistful reminder of ambitions that led him to
    seek public office in 1987 & has kept him active in
    politics ever since. Turning to the east, he looks at St.
    Paul’s Cathedral & the skyscrapers of the
    City’s financial district, a stark rejoinder to
    the task that occupies him these days: returning the firm he
    co-founded, Marshall Wace, to its former glory.

    Largely as a result of his passionate interest in politics, the
    50-year old Marshall stepped back from the investment side of
    the firm in 2004 and was rumored to be considered for
    Parliament in recent years. That had left Ian Wace, with whom
    he had started the firm in 1997, in charge. As markets began to
    tumble last year, taking Marshall Wace’s many
    hedge funds with it, Marshall, who had retained the title of
    chairman, returned to a more active role while maintaining his
    policy work regulating hedge funds, arguing against the U.K.
    ban on short selling and calling for limits on leverage and
    more disclosure for the industry.

    Now, getting Marshall Wace’s own house in order is
    the task at hand. Most of Marshall Wace’s hedge
    funds underperformed their indices last year, with its flagship
    Eureka fund down more than 19%, raising questions about the
    volatility of its innovative trading system, TOPS (Trade
    Optimized Portfolio System), which had propelled Marshall Wace
    to the upper tier of the European hedge fund industry. Poor
    performance and loose liquidity terms at the once-heralded fund
    led investors to flee. By the end of June, Marshall
    Wace’s assets had plunged by more than 75% to $3.5
    billion, from $15.8 billion at their peak in January 2008. At
    that time, Marshall Wace was the sixth largest European hedge
    fund firm, according to EuroHedge’s semiannual
    survey. It now ranks nineteenth.

    That’s quite a comedown for Marshall Wace, which
    has long been one of the most successful and talked-about hedge
    fund groups in Europe, its growth spurred by the introduction
    in 2002 of TOPS, which was widely copied in Europe and the U.S.
    But TOPS depends on analysts’ and
    brokers’ predictions to make market bets and takes
    positions in large-cap stocks. When those own views proved
    wrongheaded, and the stocks collapsed, so did the TOPS funds.
    Was TOPS merely a bull-market phenomenon that tracked the
    markets, leaving no room for managerial discretion?

    Last year’s losses have prompted a rethinking at
    Marshall Wace. The firm is quickly adding manager-led
    long/short funds to its stable in Asia and the U.K. and hiring
    the best talent from places such as Morgan
    Stanley’s prop desk. It’s also
    refining the TOPS process. "We have to innovate every day in
    order to enhance the way we extract and use the information,"
    says Marshall. Learning from last year, for example, the firm
    is putting more focus on external risk factors such as
    correlations with other hedge fund managers. Marshall Wace is
    also in the vanguard of firms offering new retail funds for
    sale throughout Europe, using UCITS (Undertakings for
    Collective Investments in Transferable Securities)
    structures.

    Marshall insists that the firm had not become too
    one-dimensional with its dependency on the TOPS process.
    "It’s true that as managers of the business we
    were heavily focused on the global rollout of TOPS, but we had
    always wanted to build out the fundamental long/short side of
    the business," he says. In addition to its numerous TOPS funds,
    in November 2006, Marshall Wace issued public stock in MW TOPS,
    a closed-end investment company, which proved to be the largest
    ever offering of permanent capital from a hedge fund firm,
    raising €1.5 billion.

    "We realized that we had built a first-rate global
    information-gathering and execution platform, along with a
    strong brand name," says Marshall. "That gave us the bandwidth
    to expand and also proved to be a big advantage in attracting
    the right talent, which is always very hard to find."

    MW TOPS shares have slid on the open market, however, and the
    fund is now worth just €180 million ($230 million). Being
    a brand name firm didn’t prove helpful in
    retaining investors’ money in its hedge funds
    either, although Marshall Wace’s refusal to lock
    up capital has won it admiration. "Because they acted honestly
    in the crisis, it’s firms like Marshall Wace that
    people will return to," says Caron Bastianpillai, a portfolio
    manager at Notz Stucki in Geneva. 

    The money may not be coming back yet, but performance has
    already started to rebound. That doesn’t answer
    the question as to whether or not TOPS just follows market
    rallies, however. Marshall Wace contends that the TOPS
    strategies capture more of the market’s upside
    than they do losses on the downside. At any rate, the TOPS
    comeback may put to rest the argument that its TOPS system was
    too widely copied to work anymore. This year its TOPS Europe
    fund is up 18.11% through August, well above both the median of
    7.68% for the EuroHedge long/short index, after being down
    about 20% in 2008, compared with a median decline of 9.21% for
    the index last year.

    Paul Marshall and Ian Wace brought different but complementary
    skill sets when they formed their partnership in 1997. Ian Wace
    started his working life at SG Warburg (now part of UBS),
    where, at the precocious age of 25, he became the youngest ever
    director. Marshall’s first job was as a
    scaffolder—despite having earned a degree in history
    and modern languages at Oxford University and an MBA from the
    INSEAD Business School near Paris. Marshall went on to become
    the chief investment officer for European equities at Mercury
    Asset Management, the largest fund manager in Europe at the
    time. In contrast, Wace was a gifted trader who rose to become
    head of proprietary trading at Warburg before moving on to
    serve as global head of equity and derivatives trading at
    Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

    "Paul is very articulate and thoughtful and works well as the
    public face of the firm," says one former investor, explaining
    how the two complement each other. Marshall’s
    public role has been aided by his involvement in British
    politics and work on hedge fund regulation, which the firm
    embraces. On the other hand, the investor says, "Ian is an
    extraordinarily talented and driven individual who can identify
    decent managerial talent and has largely been responsible for
    building the global operational infrastructure." (Further
    illustrating Wace’s role as the inside man, he
    declined to be interviewed for this article.)

    During its first five years of operations, Marshall Wace
    focused on building its flagship vehicle, Eureka Fund, a
    European biased long/short equity fund which was running assets
    of some $593 million at midyear. The fund is co-managed by
    Marshall and Wace and has since become something of a
    multistrategy feeder into the many other vehicles they manage.
    Despite its losses last year, Eureka still is outdoing the
    competition over time. Since inception in 1998, Eureka has a
    net annualized return of 14.32% through August of 2009,
    compared with 9.87% for the EuroHedge European Long/Short
    Index. 

    One of the firm’s earliest backers was George
    Soros, who alone accounted for half of the initial $60 million
    raised. Today, institutional investors make up most of the
    investor base.

    The firm really took off following the conclusion of a
    long-running debate between the founders as to whether
    brokers’ and analysts’
    recommendations offered any economic value. Coming from the buy
    side, Marshall argued that investment research and sell-side
    ideas provided virtually no value whereas Wace believed
    investment banks wouldn’t spend billions of
    dollars on research if it were a waste of time. Ultimately,
    Marshall says, "Ian was proved right." At the very least, these
    recommendations do move markets, Marshall Wace learned.

    The partners decided to resolve the issue by asking Anthony
    Clake, a young Oxford University graduate, to start measuring
    the sell-side recommendations. "We asked the 40 people who
    covered our account at that time to produce their ideas in a
    virtual portfolio format and send Web-based texts, rather than
    sending us e-mails or telephone messages," recalls
    Marshall.

    Clake was asked to design a filter that would assess investment
    recommendations by not only looking at companies, but also
    measuring the behavior of brokers and the performance of the
    ideas they generated. The filtering tool that emerged, TOPS,
    employs algorithms to analyze and evaluate
    stockbrokers’ best tips and feeds them into an
    enormous interactive database of sell-side recommendations.
    Contributors provide as many recommendations as they like
    through a dedicated Website, but they are also expected to
    quantify their convictions by stating how much would be
    invested in a virtual world. Marshall Wace sets limitations on
    each stock in terms of market capitalization and
    liquidity.

    "Having created an electronic order trail and measuring every
    contributor, we found that not only was there very significant
    alpha in the information we captured, but we could also
    optimize the alpha and create even further value by translating
    it into real portfolios," explains Marshall. "The system
    reverse-engineers our relationship with the Street." 

    Because the system is electronic, TOPS can cope with far more
    ideas than the average fund manager. The system takes a high
    number of extremely small positions—the maximum
    position cannot exceed 3% of net asset value in any
    portfolio—that are generally held on a medium-term
    basis for six to 12 months. What the system didn’t
    anticipate, however, is that the liquidity of its holdings
    would subject it to extreme turmoil, as occurred last
    year.

    In addition, Marshall Wace broke new ground by decoupling trade
    recommendations and trade orders by placing a trade with the
    broker it judges to be most able to execute it. Brokers who
    provide the best ideas might not necessarily receive a direct
    order, but they will be paid for their recommendations. But
    most of the firm’s substantial commissions are
    directed toward those securities firms whose ideas proved to be
    most helpful.

    "They have always been ready to embrace new concepts when other
    competitors have never even considered them," says Kevin
    Gundle, senior executive officer of London-based Aurum Funds.
    "Paul and Ian share a combination of a very sharp intellect and
    an open-mindedness for really pushing the envelope."

    Because the firm trades in large blocks as well as making
    hundreds of trades each day, it generates a huge volume of
    business. Until last year, Marshall Wace accounted for an
    estimated 2% to 3% of overall trading on European exchanges and
    as much as 4% on the London Stock Exchange. A novice broker at
    an investment bank could accelerate his career prospects by
    becoming involved in TOPS, which receives contributions from
    approximately 3,000 people in more than 50 countries.

    Led by 29-year-old Clake, 60 of the firm’s 140
    employees are working on TOPS. The team includes actual rocket
    scientists, such as Aron Cooper, who heads portfolio management
    in Marshall Wace’s U.S. office. Cooper holds a
    M.S.in aeronautics and astronautics from the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology and worked at the NASA Goddard Space
    Flight Center before moving into the investment industry.

    The success of TOPS generated both controversy and imitators.
    Critics have argued that although TOPS may have transformed the
    relationship between the buy side and the sell side, it might
    be guilty of providing privileged information that could
    generate conflicts of interest. Marshall adamantly denies these
    charges, however, and the U.K. Financial Services Authority
    gave it a pass in 2006.

    "If you look at TOPS, every trade comes from a broker, and
    there is a transparent electronic audit trail from us to the
    brokers who are then also able to do their own compliance check
    on their person who puts an idea into the system," says
    Marshall. "So, from a compliance perspective, it’s
    the most bulletproof system that exists. The advantage we may
    enjoy is that in any market there is always somebody who gets
    the first call from a salesman with a new
    idea—particularly if you’re the largest
    firm," he says. "We don’t get the first call in
    the U.S. because we’re not the biggest trader in
    that market, but we probably do get one of the first calls in
    Europe. Yet, whether or not we get the first call, TOPS reacts
    very quickly to that information."

    Marshall’s defense was backed by a report on these
    so-called alpha capture systems, as the TOPS process became
    known, by the Financial Services Authority, which said in a
    2006 report that largely because of the audit trail, the risk
    of obtaining privileged information through these systems
    "might be lower than through traditional communication
    methods."

    The success of TOPS led a number of hedge fund managers to
    launch their own version, and rivals are nipping at Marshall
    Wace’s heels. Firms such as Two Sigma in New York
    City, which has basically replicated the TOPS process, have
    proved to be the most direct competitors.

    The latest to introduce a rival strategy is GSA Capital
    Partners in London, known for its quant-based and statistical
    arbitrage skills, which launched the GSA Alpha Capture Fund in
    2008 and has raised about $200 million. "Being quant managers
    who were very familiar with high-frequency equity trading and
    short-term forecasting, we had been watching how TOPS operates
    for quite some time and greatly admired what we regarded as a
    genius process," says Jonathan Hiscock, a founder and managing
    partner of GSA. 

    Though Marshall Wace may be the first, Hiscock argues his firm
    might become the leader, as the firm with the "best mousetrap
    that can suck out as much alpha from the information as
    possible and create the best returns ... will be the top
    player. We’re confident that we’ve
    developed a pretty good mousetrap."

    Another well-known firm using a TOPS-like strategy is Gartmore
    Investment Management in London. Meanwhile, FactSet in New York
    City, First Coverage in Toronto, and YouDevise in London have
    created similar platforms.

    But as Sanford Bragg, president and chief executive officer of
    New York City’s Integrity Research Associates,
    points out, "These platforms don’t have anywhere
    near the sophisticated modeling that Marshall Wace possesses.
    Because they don’t offer performance measurement,
    customers can’t gauge how to compare them to other
    sell-side ideas."

    Still, the competition hurts, as has the slide in Marshall
    Wace’s assets. "The problem for Marshall Wace is
    that the new platforms have distracted the sell side, and the
    firm is not getting the tender loving care that it had in the
    past," says Bragg. "Wall Street is very mercenary and when your
    assets drop sharply, you get less attention. It therefore
    diminishes the carrot that Marshall Wace can offer to the sell
    side." 

    The European track record for TOPS started in mid-2002 when the
    first allocation to MW European TOPS came from the Eureka fund,
    which serves as a feeder into several TOPS vehicles as well as
    having a manager-led component. The firm launched MW Americas
    TOPS in 2005, MW Asian TOPS in June 2006, and MW Global TOPS MW
    Market Neutral TOPS in 2007. The latest TOPS offering is called
    TOPS Bespoke Product Design, which offers customized products
    either by creating a new strategy within the TOPS platform or
    through a managed account. "In terms of net capital flows since
    May, there has been a distinctive bias towards managed accounts
    where we have seen quite rapid growth," says Marshall.

    With the dual flotation of MW TOPS on Amsterdam’s
    Euronext exchange in 2006 and later on the London Stock
    Exchange in 2008, Marshall Wace bolstered its reputation as an
    innovative firm by having the largest hedge fund flotation to
    date. Offering daily liquidity and the opportunity to invest in
    various hedge fund strategies, the closed-end investment
    company aimed to broaden the firm’s retail
    base.

    The listing benefited from buoyant market conditions and the
    good returns that the TOPS process had been generating. Last
    October, however, as a result of a widening discount to the
    fund’s underlying NAV amid plunging equity
    markets, Marshall Wace allowed investors to cash out their
    shares. As a result, the value of the listed vehicle has sunk
    to $230 million. On September 17, the estimated NAV of the
    sterling share class stood at 1,032 pence and the closing price
    was 865 pence, indicating a discount of 14.7%.

    Whether or not TOPS remains the firm’s central
    strategy, Marshall Wace determined it needed to build up other
    businesses. In June 2008, the firm formed a joint venture,
    Marshall Wace GaveKal Asia Limited, with Hong
    Kong’s GaveKal Holdings, a research boutique and
    fund management company. "We combined their expertise and
    knowledge of the Asian markets with our stock picking,
    execution and risk management skills," says Marshall.

    The new venture is responsible for the management of
    GaveKal’s absolute return funds with nearly $300
    million under management. Last December, it launched the MW
    GaveKal Japan Fund (Market Neutral) and the MW GaveKal Japan
    Fund (Dynamic Net Exposure).

    To broaden the manager-led strategies, Marshall Wace took
    advantage of the financial crisis to recruit top talent to run
    additional new long/short funds. After hiring Amit Rajpal from
    Morgan Stanley, where he ran Asian proprietary trading in Hong
    Kong and was responsible for the global financials portfolio,
    the firm launched Global Financials Fund, with an emerging
    markets bias, in late 2008. This was followed in February 2009
    by the Global Opportunities Fund, led by Fehim Sever, a former
    manager of the award-winning Fidelity European Fund, out of
    London. Since inception, Global Opportunities has returned more
    than 19%. Another key hire, Rod Rehnborg, who previously worked
    for Rosehill Capital in El Segundo, Calif., and is a 15-year
    veteran of investing in Japanese markets, was recruited to run
    the MW GaveKal funds.

    Marshall Wace is also trying to gain a bigger toehold in the
    U.S. market. In June, it brought on Jordan Foster, former
    managing director at Intrepid Capital Management of New York
    City, as head of marketing for North America to nab more U.S.
    institutional investors. 

    Marshall Wace’s U.S. office opened in May 2004,
    and operations began in February 2005 with the launch of the
    long/short equity TOPS Americas, with a relatively modest $194
    million in assets. As a result, Marshall Wace became one of the
    few European hedge funds whose U.S. business included an
    investment management function as well as a marketing
    operation. TOPS Americas is the only vehicle managed in the
    U.S. 

"The intention
    of our office from the outset was to prove to ourselves and our
    clients that the TOPS process was not only robust within a
    European context, but could also be imported into a new region
    and still deliver the same sort of attractive risk-adjusted
    returns," says Michael Sargent (right), chief
    executive officer of Marshall Wace, North America.

    Essentially, Marshall Wace has created a microcosm of the main
    London office in the U.S. "Our great advantage is that because
    we’ve built a globally consistent infrastructure,
    there is no need to have redundant systems in each region,"
    adds Sargent. "So our business has many of the same
    capabilities as London—just writ smaller."

    Although Paul Marshall has returned to a more active role at
    the firm, he hasn’t totally abandoned his
    political activities—including those on behalf of the
    hedge fund industry.

    Marshall had his first taste of the rough-and-tumble of
    electoral politics in 1987 when he unsuccessfully ran for
    Parliament for the SDP/Liberal Alliance in
    London’s Fulham constituency. Despite rumors that
    he was interested in running again, he hasn’t
    ventured back into the electoral arena and says he has no
    interest in doing so. Nevertheless, he has stayed heavily
    involved in the SDP’s successor, the Liberal
    Democrats, which is the third-largest party in Parliament, and
    serves as an adviser to Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal
    Democrats. Marshall was the founding chairman of City Liberal
    Democrats and has also held the chairmanship of the Liberal
    Democrat Business Forum.

    "I’m a 'liberal’ in the
    British—not the American—sense, which means
    combining economic liberalism with social justice," says
    Marshall. "I believe everyone should have the same
    opportunities as I did. We must strive to create a level
    playing field, but we shouldn’t aim to equalize
    the outcomes."

    In the past 10 years, Marshall has coedited several books on
    economic and social policy, including the "Orange Book" in
    2004, which had a significant impact on the
    party’s thinking. "The book was basically trying
    to get back to the roots of liberalism, because the party was
    neglecting its liberal economic history," he says. "We needed
    to resurrect the philosophy of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill and
    William Gladstone, all of whom advocated free trade and a
    smaller state. So it was necessary to combine the four key
    strands of political, personal, social and economic liberalism
    to find solutions to contemporary problems."

    Marshall’s passion for policy has found an
    intellectual outlet through his chairmanship of the independent
    liberal think tank, CentreForum, which he launched in 2005.
    Although CentreForum has attracted various donors, Marshall is
    the chief benefactor, having underwritten the £1 million
    launch.

    In another arena, both Wace and Marshall were founder trustees
    in 2002 of the children’s charity, Absolute Return
    for Kids, undoubtedly the favored charity of the London hedge
    fund community. ARK annually raises significant amounts of
    money to improve the lives of children who are victims of
    abuse, disabled or poor. In addition, Marshall serves as a
    trustee of Every Child a Chance Trust, which also runs programs
    to help socially disadvantaged children.

    Perhaps Marshall’s greatest contribution to both
    policy and hedge funds has been his role in the global debate
    over new hedge fund regulation.

    Marshall Wace was one of the 14 principal hedge fund managers
    to establish the Hedge Fund Working Group in 2007, which
    eventually evolved into the Hedge Fund Standards Board (on
    which Marshall serves as a director). The firm is also
    represented on the steering committee of the Alternative
    Investment Association, the global hedge fund
    industry’s trade group.

    "It’s very clear that our investment strategies
    are more complex than those of traditional managers," says
    Marshall. "We therefore created a set of standards, which
    interpret the Financial Services Authority’s 11
    principles in relation to issues which are particularly
    relevant to hedge funds, such as disclosure, valuation, risk
    management and governance, and which the majority of
    Europe’s larger hedge funds have now signed up
    to."

    Marshall argued forcefully against the four-month ban on short
    selling in the U.K., which he believes has proved to be a
    mistake. Instead, he says, the relationship between short
    selling and financial stability should be addressed by a
    sensible disclosure policy. He thinks the FSA should monitor
    overall figures on short positions, rather than those of
    individual funds, and that could be combined with individual
    disclosure of short positions in excess of 3%, the same
    standard that is applied to the long side. Although he
    doesn’t expect a future U.K. ban on short selling,
    he says, "there may well be a ban on naked short selling, which
    I think is perfectly fair."

    For Marshall, it’s essential that the fight for
    regulatory reform adopts a global perspective toward creating a
    new set of standards for the hedge fund industry and,
    therefore, he praised the G-20 meeting in April when it
    announced that the Financial Stability Board would work to
    develop hedge fund standards. "If you don’t take a
    global approach, you will have regulatory competition, and that
    normally leads to a leveling down of standards," he
    asserts.

    By the same token, he is highly critical of the current draft
    European Union Directive, which aims to apply regional rules
    that would transfer power to the Brussels authorities. In a
    recent article in the Financial Times, he described this move
    as "a classic exercise in closet protectionism."

    In the U.S., Marshall recognizes that there are political
    pressures for better regulations and supports the registration
    of U.S. hedge funds, better control over leverage provided to
    the hedge fund industry by prime brokers and a willingness on
    the part of hedge funds to provide a greater degree of
    transparency for the regulators in terms of the leverage they
    employ.

    "Back in 2006 to 2007, prime brokers were lending to hedge
    funds which had highly leveraged, illiquid equities," he says.
    "But if they had been extending credit to hedge funds on more
    appropriate terms, many of these hedge funds which blew up
    wouldn’t have been able to deploy their capital in
    the same way."

    Having survived the severe downturn in the assets that it
    manages, Marshall Wace has demonstrated that it has the
    capacity to come back fighting—partly through the
    strong performance that many of its funds have generated this
    year. While the TOPS process will remain at the core of the
    firm’s strategy for the foreseeable future, the
    fortunes of the firm will also depend on the success of the
    manager-led funds it is now developing as well as the new UCITS
    structures it will likewise embrace.

    Marshall Wace was among the first London-based hedge fund firms
    to offer these European products with the launch of a UCITS
    III-compliant version of an MW TOPS market-neutral strategy in
    2008. The products are taking off because they allow funds to
    be sold freely throughout the EU both to retail and
    institutional investors who cannot invest in offshore vehicles
    and are seeking low minimum entry levels as well as daily
    liquidity. 

    Marshall Wace believes its funds are highly adaptable for a
    UCITS wrapper because they employ modest leverage and are
    highly liquid. 

    Says Notze Stucki’s Bastianpillai, "Unlike the
    typical hedge fund model, Marshall Wace has a key edge in that
    it can readapt its original classic, long/short model over and
    over again."

Consultancy leader at a global prime brokerage business









While other publications tend to brush the surface of this industry, HFM’s strength is its ability to really cover a huge array of issues. The level of technical detail it provides serves a vital information need. We often pick up valuable insight in HFM before being told by our primes and external counsel.
