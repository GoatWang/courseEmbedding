Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is an American politician, lawyer, and banker, who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011.
His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.[1][2]
In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company.[3]

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Cantor, the second of three children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Mary Lee (née Hudes), a schoolteacher, and Eddie Cantor, who owned a real estate firm. His family emigrated from Eastern Europe (Russia, Romania, and Latvia) in the late 1800s and early 1900s.[4][5] His father was the state treasurer for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.[6] Cantor was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4]
He graduated from the Collegiate School, a co-ed private school in Richmond, in 1981. He enrolled at George Washington University (GW) in 1981, and as a freshman he worked as an intern for House Republican Tom Bliley of Virginia and was Bliley's driver in the 1982 campaign.[7] Cantor was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at GW and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[8] He earned a Juris Doctor degree from William & Mary Law School in 1988, and received a Master of Science in Real Estate Development from Columbia University in 1989.[9]
Cantor worked for over a decade with his father's business doing legal work and real estate development.
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992–January 1, 2001.[9] At various times he was a member of committees on Science and Technology, Corporation Insurance and Banking, General Laws, Courts of Justice, (co-chairman) Claims.[10][11] Cantor announced on March 14, 2000 that he would seek the seat in the United States House of Representatives that was being vacated by Tom Bliley. Cantor had chaired Bliley's reelection campaigns for the previous six years, and immediately gained the support of Bliley's political organization, as well as Bliley's endorsement later in the primary.[12]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Committee assignments[edit]
During his first term, Cantor was chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. He has also served on the House Financial Services Committee and on the House International Relations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.
Party leadership[edit]
In 2002–only a few weeks after winning a second term–Roy Blunt appointed Cantor Chief Deputy Republican Whip, the highest appointed position in the Republican caucus.[13]

On November 19, 2008, Cantor was unanimously elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, after serving as Deputy Whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt had decided not to seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members.[1][13] Cantor became the Majority Leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011.[14] In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was considered the leader of the House Republicans.
Cantor is a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Republican National Committee. He is one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, having raised over $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).[15] He is also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program. In the fall of 2010, Cantor wrote a New York Times bestselling book, Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders, with the other two founding members of Young Guns.[16] They describe the vision outlined in the book as "a clear agenda based on common sense for the common good".[17] Cantor said in 2010 that he worked with the Tea Party movement in his district.[18]
As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 government shutdown began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.[19][20][21]
Legislation[edit]
Cantor was a strong supporter of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller's honor.[22] The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[22][23] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[22][23] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[24] Cantor said that the bill "clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions".[22]
Political positions[edit]
For much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress.[1][9][25] He supports strong United States–Israel relations.[8][9] He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.[26] Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75 million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to Palestinians.[27]
In May 2008, Cantor said that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is not a "constant sore" but rather "a constant reminder of the greatness of America",[28] and following Barack Obama's election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a "stronger U.S.–Israel relationship" remains a top priority for him and that he would be "very outspoken" if Obama "did anything to undermine those ties."[1][29] Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor's office, he "stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration" and "made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States."[30] Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy;[31] one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the President of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility "that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American 'without authority of the United States' to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government's behavior on any disputes with the United States."[32]
Social issues[edit]
Cantor opposed public funding of embryonic stem cell research and opposed elective abortion. He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record. He was also opposed to same-sex marriage as of the mid-2000s, voting to Constitutionally define marriage as between a male and a female in 2006. In November 2007 he voted against prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also supported making flag burning illegal. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated him 19% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action voting record. He was opposed to gun control, voting to ban product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers in 2005, and he voted not to require gun registration and trigger-lock laws in the District of Columbia. He had a rating of "A" from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[33] On November 2, 2010, Cantor told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that he would try to trim the federal deficit by reducing welfare.
Economy, budgeting, and trade[edit]
Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia. He also voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He voted against raising the minimum wage to US$7.25 in 2007. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the largest federation of trade unions in the United States, rates Cantor 0%, indicating an anti-Union voting record.
In October 2008, Cantor advocated and voted for the TARP program which aided distressed banks.[34]
On September 29, 2008 Cantor blamed Pelosi for what he felt was the failure of the $700 billion economic bailout bill.[35] He noted that 94 Democrats voted against the measure, as well as 133 Republicans. Though supporting the Federal bailout of the nation's largest private banks, he referred to Pelosi's proposal to appoint a Car czar to run the US Automobile Industry Bailout as a "bureaucratic" imposition on private business.[36]
The following February, Cantor led Republicans in the House of Representatives in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[37] and was a prominent spokesman in voicing the many issues he and his fellow Republicans had with the legislation. Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses,[38] despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.[39]
In his book Young Guns, Cantor summarized Keynesian economics with the following opinion, "The idea is that the government can be counted on to spend more wisely than the people."[40]
As Majority Leader, Cantor steered the STOCK Act through the House, which requires Congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner.[41] The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012. It was ultimately signed by President Obama on April 4, 2012.[42] In July 2012, CNN reported that changes made by the House version of the legislation excluded reporting requirements by spouses and dependent children. Initially, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act; however, when presented with new information from CNN, the Majority Leader's office recognized that changes had unintentionally been made and offered technical corrections to fulfill the original intent of the legislation.[43] These corrections were passed by Congress on August 3, 2012.[44]
As Majority Leader, Cantor shepherded the JOBS Act through the House, which combined bipartisan ideas for economic growth – like crowdfunding for startups – into one piece of legislation. Ultimately, President Obama, Eric Cantor, Steve Case and other leaders joined together at the signing ceremony.[45]
Cantor has proposed initiatives which purport to help small businesses grow, including a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that employ fewer than 500 people.[46]
Other foreign affairs[edit]
In an article he wrote for the National Review in 2007, he condemned Nancy Pelosi's diplomatic visit to Syria, and her subsequent meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, whom he referred to as a "dictator and terror-sponsor"; saying that if "Speaker Pelosi's diplomatic foray into Syria weren’t so harmful to U.S. interests in the Middle East, it would have been laughable."[47]
In 2014, Cantor criticized what he referred to as "the isolationist sentiment" and said that it was a mistake to withdraw from Iraq and had called for troops to remain in Afghanistan.[48]
During the 2016 presidential election Cantor, a supporter of Israel,[49] called on Donald Trump to be more consistent with his support for Israel.[50]

Cantor formerly represented Virginia's 7th congressional district, which stretches from the western end of Richmond, through its suburbs, and northward to Page, Rappahannock Culpeper and parts of Spotsylvania, county. It also includes the towns of Mechanicsville and Laurel. The district is strongly Republican; it has been in Republican hands since 1981 (it was numbered as the 3rd District prior to 1993).[51]
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991, winning the race for the 73rd district seat unopposed.[citation needed] He was re-elected in 1993 with 79% of the vote.[citation needed] He won re-election in 1995, 1997, and 1999; in all three races he was unopposed.[citation needed]
House of Representatives[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, succeeding retiring 20-year incumbent Republican Tom Bliley. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Warren A. Stewart, by nearly 100,000 votes.[52] Cantor had won the closely contested Republican primary over state Senator Stephen Martin by only 263 votes. During his first term, he was one of only two Jewish Republicans serving concurrently in the House of Representatives, the other being Benjamin A. Gilman of New York. Gilman retired in 2002 leaving Cantor as the only Jewish Republican House member.
In 2002, Cantor was opposed by Democrat Ben Jones, a former congressman from Georgia, who had played "Cooter Davenport" in the TV Series The Dukes of Hazzard.[53][54]
In 2004, Cantor was opposed by Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 75.5% of the vote.[citation needed] In 2006, Cantor was opposed by Democrat James M. Nachman and Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 64% to Nachman's 34% and Blanton's 2%.[citation needed]
In August 2008, news reports surfaced that Cantor was being considered as John McCain's Vice Presidential running mate, with McCain's representatives seeking documents from Cantor as part of its vetting process.[55][56][57] The idea for Cantor to be McCain's running mate was supported by conservative leaders like Richard Land and Erick Erickson.[58][59] Cantor was not selected for the vice presidential nomination, and in his 2008 re-election campaign, Cantor defeated Democratic challenger Anita Hartke 63%-37%.
In 2010, Cantor was re-elected with 59% of the vote.[60]
In 2012, Cantor faced a primary challenger, Floyd C. Bayne, in the June 12 Republican primary; Cantor won the primary with 79% of the vote[61] and then defeated Democratic challenger Wayne Powell in the general election. Although he won with 58% of the vote, Cantor received his lowest vote percentage since being elected to Congress in 2000.[citation needed]

On June 10, 2014, in a major upset, Cantor lost the Republican primary 44.5%–55.5% to Dave Brat, a Tea Party candidate and a professor at Randolph-Macon College. That made Cantor the first sitting House majority leader to lose a primary since the position was created in 1899.[62][63][64][65] Internal campaign polls before the primary showed Cantor 30 points ahead of Brat,[66] and he outspent Brat 40 to 1.[67]
Cantor's loss in the primary was described by the Los Angeles Times as "one of the greatest political upsets of modern times."[66] His loss was attributed to numerous factors including a moderating of his views after entering House leadership, being disconnected from his district, a lack of enthusiasm among his supporters, low turnout for the primary election, and support of Brat from radio talk show hosts.[68]
Although the national media were shocked at Brat's victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble.[69] The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor's constituents felt he took them for granted. The Times-Dispatch also revealed that Cantor's attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat.[70] The Chesterfield Observer, a local paper serving Chesterfield County—roughly half of which is in the 7th—reported that Tea-Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled "blood in the water."[71] One local reporter told David Carr of The New York Times that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. However, due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely under-polled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor's district, for fear that they would be out of Washington in case a major story broke.[69]
Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his resignation as House Majority Leader effective on July 31, 2014, and declared that he would not campaign for the general election. In an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 31, 2014, Cantor announced his resignation from Congress effective on August 18, 2014, and said that he had asked Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a special election on November 4, 2014 to coincide with the 2014 general election.[72][73][74]
On Tuesday, September 2, 2014, Moelis & Company announced that it was appointing Eric Cantor as vice chairman and managing director and that he would be elected to the Moelis & Company board of directors.[75]
Threats and campaign office incident[edit]
After the passage of the health care reform bill in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. A spokesman for the Richmond police later stated that the bullet was not intentionally fired at Cantor's office, saying that it was instead random gunfire, as there were no signs outside the office identifying the office as being Cantor's.[76] Cantor responded to this by saying that Democratic leaders in the House should stop "dangerously fanning the flames" by blaming Republicans for threats against House Democrats who voted for the health care legislation.[77]
Cantor also reported that he had received threatening e-mails related to the passage of the bill.[78] In March 2010, Norman Leboon was arrested for making threats against Cantor and his family.[79]
In 2011, Cantor received two threatening phone calls from Glendon Swift who left "screaming, profanity-laden messages [that] allegedly stated that he was going to destroy Cantor, rape his daughter and kill his wife." Swift was sentenced in April 2012 to 13 months in federal prison.[80]

Personal life[edit]
Cantor met his wife, Diana Marcy Fine, on a blind date; and they were married in 1989.[10][25][84] They have three children, Evan, Jenna, and Michael, and live in Wyndham, an unincorporated suburban community near Richmond (though Cantor was listed in the House roll as "R-Richmond"). Contrary to her husband, she is a lifelong, liberal Democrat, is pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage.[85]
Diana Cantor is a lawyer and certified public accountant. She founded, and from 1996 until 2008 was executive director of, the Virginia College Savings Plan (an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia). She was also chairman of the board of the College Savings Plans Network.[84][86][87] Mrs. Cantor is a managing director in a division of Emigrant Bank, a subsidiary of New York Private Bank & Trust Corp.

Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is an American politician, lawyer, and banker, who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011.
His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.[1][2]
In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company.[3]

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Cantor, the second of three children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Mary Lee (née Hudes), a schoolteacher, and Eddie Cantor, who owned a real estate firm. His family emigrated from Eastern Europe (Russia, Romania, and Latvia) in the late 1800s and early 1900s.[4][5] His father was the state treasurer for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.[6] Cantor was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4]
He graduated from the Collegiate School, a co-ed private school in Richmond, in 1981. He enrolled at George Washington University (GW) in 1981, and as a freshman he worked as an intern for House Republican Tom Bliley of Virginia and was Bliley's driver in the 1982 campaign.[7] Cantor was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at GW and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[8] He earned a Juris Doctor degree from William & Mary Law School in 1988, and received a Master of Science in Real Estate Development from Columbia University in 1989.[9]
Cantor worked for over a decade with his father's business doing legal work and real estate development.
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992–January 1, 2001.[9] At various times he was a member of committees on Science and Technology, Corporation Insurance and Banking, General Laws, Courts of Justice, (co-chairman) Claims.[10][11] Cantor announced on March 14, 2000 that he would seek the seat in the United States House of Representatives that was being vacated by Tom Bliley. Cantor had chaired Bliley's reelection campaigns for the previous six years, and immediately gained the support of Bliley's political organization, as well as Bliley's endorsement later in the primary.[12]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Committee assignments[edit]
During his first term, Cantor was chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. He has also served on the House Financial Services Committee and on the House International Relations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.
Party leadership[edit]
In 2002–only a few weeks after winning a second term–Roy Blunt appointed Cantor Chief Deputy Republican Whip, the highest appointed position in the Republican caucus.[13]

On November 19, 2008, Cantor was unanimously elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, after serving as Deputy Whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt had decided not to seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members.[1][13] Cantor became the Majority Leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011.[14] In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was considered the leader of the House Republicans.
Cantor is a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Republican National Committee. He is one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, having raised over $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).[15] He is also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program. In the fall of 2010, Cantor wrote a New York Times bestselling book, Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders, with the other two founding members of Young Guns.[16] They describe the vision outlined in the book as "a clear agenda based on common sense for the common good".[17] Cantor said in 2010 that he worked with the Tea Party movement in his district.[18]
As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 government shutdown began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.[19][20][21]
Legislation[edit]
Cantor was a strong supporter of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller's honor.[22] The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[22][23] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[22][23] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[24] Cantor said that the bill "clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions".[22]
Political positions[edit]
For much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress.[1][9][25] He supports strong United States–Israel relations.[8][9] He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.[26] Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75 million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to Palestinians.[27]
In May 2008, Cantor said that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is not a "constant sore" but rather "a constant reminder of the greatness of America",[28] and following Barack Obama's election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a "stronger U.S.–Israel relationship" remains a top priority for him and that he would be "very outspoken" if Obama "did anything to undermine those ties."[1][29] Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor's office, he "stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration" and "made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States."[30] Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy;[31] one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the President of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility "that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American 'without authority of the United States' to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government's behavior on any disputes with the United States."[32]
Social issues[edit]
Cantor opposed public funding of embryonic stem cell research and opposed elective abortion. He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record. He was also opposed to same-sex marriage as of the mid-2000s, voting to Constitutionally define marriage as between a male and a female in 2006. In November 2007 he voted against prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also supported making flag burning illegal. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated him 19% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action voting record. He was opposed to gun control, voting to ban product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers in 2005, and he voted not to require gun registration and trigger-lock laws in the District of Columbia. He had a rating of "A" from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[33] On November 2, 2010, Cantor told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that he would try to trim the federal deficit by reducing welfare.
Economy, budgeting, and trade[edit]
Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia. He also voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He voted against raising the minimum wage to US$7.25 in 2007. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the largest federation of trade unions in the United States, rates Cantor 0%, indicating an anti-Union voting record.
In October 2008, Cantor advocated and voted for the TARP program which aided distressed banks.[34]
On September 29, 2008 Cantor blamed Pelosi for what he felt was the failure of the $700 billion economic bailout bill.[35] He noted that 94 Democrats voted against the measure, as well as 133 Republicans. Though supporting the Federal bailout of the nation's largest private banks, he referred to Pelosi's proposal to appoint a Car czar to run the US Automobile Industry Bailout as a "bureaucratic" imposition on private business.[36]
The following February, Cantor led Republicans in the House of Representatives in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[37] and was a prominent spokesman in voicing the many issues he and his fellow Republicans had with the legislation. Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses,[38] despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.[39]
In his book Young Guns, Cantor summarized Keynesian economics with the following opinion, "The idea is that the government can be counted on to spend more wisely than the people."[40]
As Majority Leader, Cantor steered the STOCK Act through the House, which requires Congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner.[41] The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012. It was ultimately signed by President Obama on April 4, 2012.[42] In July 2012, CNN reported that changes made by the House version of the legislation excluded reporting requirements by spouses and dependent children. Initially, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act; however, when presented with new information from CNN, the Majority Leader's office recognized that changes had unintentionally been made and offered technical corrections to fulfill the original intent of the legislation.[43] These corrections were passed by Congress on August 3, 2012.[44]
As Majority Leader, Cantor shepherded the JOBS Act through the House, which combined bipartisan ideas for economic growth – like crowdfunding for startups – into one piece of legislation. Ultimately, President Obama, Eric Cantor, Steve Case and other leaders joined together at the signing ceremony.[45]
Cantor has proposed initiatives which purport to help small businesses grow, including a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that employ fewer than 500 people.[46]
Other foreign affairs[edit]
In an article he wrote for the National Review in 2007, he condemned Nancy Pelosi's diplomatic visit to Syria, and her subsequent meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, whom he referred to as a "dictator and terror-sponsor"; saying that if "Speaker Pelosi's diplomatic foray into Syria weren’t so harmful to U.S. interests in the Middle East, it would have been laughable."[47]
In 2014, Cantor criticized what he referred to as "the isolationist sentiment" and said that it was a mistake to withdraw from Iraq and had called for troops to remain in Afghanistan.[48]
During the 2016 presidential election Cantor, a supporter of Israel,[49] called on Donald Trump to be more consistent with his support for Israel.[50]

Cantor formerly represented Virginia's 7th congressional district, which stretches from the western end of Richmond, through its suburbs, and northward to Page, Rappahannock Culpeper and parts of Spotsylvania, county. It also includes the towns of Mechanicsville and Laurel. The district is strongly Republican; it has been in Republican hands since 1981 (it was numbered as the 3rd District prior to 1993).[51]
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991, winning the race for the 73rd district seat unopposed.[citation needed] He was re-elected in 1993 with 79% of the vote.[citation needed] He won re-election in 1995, 1997, and 1999; in all three races he was unopposed.[citation needed]
House of Representatives[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, succeeding retiring 20-year incumbent Republican Tom Bliley. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Warren A. Stewart, by nearly 100,000 votes.[52] Cantor had won the closely contested Republican primary over state Senator Stephen Martin by only 263 votes. During his first term, he was one of only two Jewish Republicans serving concurrently in the House of Representatives, the other being Benjamin A. Gilman of New York. Gilman retired in 2002 leaving Cantor as the only Jewish Republican House member.
In 2002, Cantor was opposed by Democrat Ben Jones, a former congressman from Georgia, who had played "Cooter Davenport" in the TV Series The Dukes of Hazzard.[53][54]
In 2004, Cantor was opposed by Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 75.5% of the vote.[citation needed] In 2006, Cantor was opposed by Democrat James M. Nachman and Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 64% to Nachman's 34% and Blanton's 2%.[citation needed]
In August 2008, news reports surfaced that Cantor was being considered as John McCain's Vice Presidential running mate, with McCain's representatives seeking documents from Cantor as part of its vetting process.[55][56][57] The idea for Cantor to be McCain's running mate was supported by conservative leaders like Richard Land and Erick Erickson.[58][59] Cantor was not selected for the vice presidential nomination, and in his 2008 re-election campaign, Cantor defeated Democratic challenger Anita Hartke 63%-37%.
In 2010, Cantor was re-elected with 59% of the vote.[60]
In 2012, Cantor faced a primary challenger, Floyd C. Bayne, in the June 12 Republican primary; Cantor won the primary with 79% of the vote[61] and then defeated Democratic challenger Wayne Powell in the general election. Although he won with 58% of the vote, Cantor received his lowest vote percentage since being elected to Congress in 2000.[citation needed]
2014 Republican primary and resignation[edit]

On June 10, 2014, in a major upset, Cantor lost the Republican primary 44.5%–55.5% to Dave Brat, a Tea Party candidate and a professor at Randolph-Macon College. That made Cantor the first sitting House majority leader to lose a primary since the position was created in 1899.[62][63][64][65] Internal campaign polls before the primary showed Cantor 30 points ahead of Brat,[66] and he outspent Brat 40 to 1.[67]
Cantor's loss in the primary was described by the Los Angeles Times as "one of the greatest political upsets of modern times."[66] His loss was attributed to numerous factors including a moderating of his views after entering House leadership, being disconnected from his district, a lack of enthusiasm among his supporters, low turnout for the primary election, and support of Brat from radio talk show hosts.[68]
Although the national media were shocked at Brat's victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble.[69] The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor's constituents felt he took them for granted. The Times-Dispatch also revealed that Cantor's attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat.[70] The Chesterfield Observer, a local paper serving Chesterfield County—roughly half of which is in the 7th—reported that Tea-Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled "blood in the water."[71] One local reporter told David Carr of The New York Times that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. However, due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely under-polled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor's district, for fear that they would be out of Washington in case a major story broke.[69]
Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his resignation as House Majority Leader effective on July 31, 2014, and declared that he would not campaign for the general election. In an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 31, 2014, Cantor announced his resignation from Congress effective on August 18, 2014, and said that he had asked Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a special election on November 4, 2014 to coincide with the 2014 general election.[72][73][74]
On Tuesday, September 2, 2014, Moelis & Company announced that it was appointing Eric Cantor as vice chairman and managing director and that he would be elected to the Moelis & Company board of directors.[75]
Threats and campaign office incident[edit]
After the passage of the health care reform bill in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. A spokesman for the Richmond police later stated that the bullet was not intentionally fired at Cantor's office, saying that it was instead random gunfire, as there were no signs outside the office identifying the office as being Cantor's.[76] Cantor responded to this by saying that Democratic leaders in the House should stop "dangerously fanning the flames" by blaming Republicans for threats against House Democrats who voted for the health care legislation.[77]
Cantor also reported that he had received threatening e-mails related to the passage of the bill.[78] In March 2010, Norman Leboon was arrested for making threats against Cantor and his family.[79]
In 2011, Cantor received two threatening phone calls from Glendon Swift who left "screaming, profanity-laden messages [that] allegedly stated that he was going to destroy Cantor, rape his daughter and kill his wife." Swift was sentenced in April 2012 to 13 months in federal prison.[80]

Personal life[edit]
Cantor met his wife, Diana Marcy Fine, on a blind date; and they were married in 1989.[10][25][84] They have three children, Evan, Jenna, and Michael, and live in Wyndham, an unincorporated suburban community near Richmond (though Cantor was listed in the House roll as "R-Richmond"). Contrary to her husband, she is a lifelong, liberal Democrat, is pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage.[85]
Diana Cantor is a lawyer and certified public accountant. She founded, and from 1996 until 2008 was executive director of, the Virginia College Savings Plan (an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia). She was also chairman of the board of the College Savings Plans Network.[84][86][87] Mrs. Cantor is a managing director in a division of Emigrant Bank, a subsidiary of New York Private Bank & Trust Corp. [88]

Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is an American politician, lawyer, and banker, who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011.
His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.[1][2]
In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company.[3]

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Cantor, the second of three children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Mary Lee (née Hudes), a schoolteacher, and Eddie Cantor, who owned a real estate firm. His family emigrated from Eastern Europe (Russia, Romania, and Latvia) in the late 1800s and early 1900s.[4][5] His father was the state treasurer for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.[6] Cantor was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4]
He graduated from the Collegiate School, a co-ed private school in Richmond, in 1981. He enrolled at George Washington University (GW) in 1981, and as a freshman he worked as an intern for House Republican Tom Bliley of Virginia and was Bliley's driver in the 1982 campaign.[7] Cantor was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at GW and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[8] He earned a Juris Doctor degree from William & Mary Law School in 1988, and received a Master of Science in Real Estate Development from Columbia University in 1989.[9]
Cantor worked for over a decade with his father's business doing legal work and real estate development.
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992–January 1, 2001.[9] At various times he was a member of committees on Science and Technology, Corporation Insurance and Banking, General Laws, Courts of Justice, (co-chairman) Claims.[10][11] Cantor announced on March 14, 2000 that he would seek the seat in the United States House of Representatives that was being vacated by Tom Bliley. Cantor had chaired Bliley's reelection campaigns for the previous six years, and immediately gained the support of Bliley's political organization, as well as Bliley's endorsement later in the primary.[12]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Committee assignments[edit]
During his first term, Cantor was chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. He has also served on the House Financial Services Committee and on the House International Relations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.
Party leadership[edit]
In 2002–only a few weeks after winning a second term–Roy Blunt appointed Cantor Chief Deputy Republican Whip, the highest appointed position in the Republican caucus.[13]

On November 19, 2008, Cantor was unanimously elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, after serving as Deputy Whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt had decided not to seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members.[1][13] Cantor became the Majority Leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011.[14] In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was considered the leader of the House Republicans.
Cantor is a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Republican National Committee. He is one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, having raised over $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).[15] He is also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program. In the fall of 2010, Cantor wrote a New York Times bestselling book, Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders, with the other two founding members of Young Guns.[16] They describe the vision outlined in the book as "a clear agenda based on common sense for the common good".[17] Cantor said in 2010 that he worked with the Tea Party movement in his district.[18]
As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 government shutdown began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.[19][20][21]
Legislation[edit]
Cantor was a strong supporter of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller's honor.[22] The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[22][23] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[22][23] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[24] Cantor said that the bill "clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions".[22]
Political positions[edit]
For much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress.[1][9][25] He supports strong United States–Israel relations.[8][9] He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.[26] Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75 million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to Palestinians.[27]
In May 2008, Cantor said that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is not a "constant sore" but rather "a constant reminder of the greatness of America",[28] and following Barack Obama's election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a "stronger U.S.–Israel relationship" remains a top priority for him and that he would be "very outspoken" if Obama "did anything to undermine those ties."[1][29] Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor's office, he "stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration" and "made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States."[30] Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy;[31] one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the President of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility "that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American 'without authority of the United States' to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government's behavior on any disputes with the United States."[32]
Social issues[edit]
Cantor opposed public funding of embryonic stem cell research and opposed elective abortion. He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record. He was also opposed to same-sex marriage as of the mid-2000s, voting to Constitutionally define marriage as between a male and a female in 2006. In November 2007 he voted against prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also supported making flag burning illegal. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated him 19% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action voting record. He was opposed to gun control, voting to ban product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers in 2005, and he voted not to require gun registration and trigger-lock laws in the District of Columbia. He had a rating of "A" from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[33] On November 2, 2010, Cantor told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that he would try to trim the federal deficit by reducing welfare.
Economy, budgeting, and trade[edit]
Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia. He also voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He voted against raising the minimum wage to US$7.25 in 2007. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the largest federation of trade unions in the United States, rates Cantor 0%, indicating an anti-Union voting record.
In October 2008, Cantor advocated and voted for the TARP program which aided distressed banks.[34]
On September 29, 2008 Cantor blamed Pelosi for what he felt was the failure of the $700 billion economic bailout bill.[35] He noted that 94 Democrats voted against the measure, as well as 133 Republicans. Though supporting the Federal bailout of the nation's largest private banks, he referred to Pelosi's proposal to appoint a Car czar to run the US Automobile Industry Bailout as a "bureaucratic" imposition on private business.[36]
The following February, Cantor led Republicans in the House of Representatives in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[37] and was a prominent spokesman in voicing the many issues he and his fellow Republicans had with the legislation. Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses,[38] despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.[39]
In his book Young Guns, Cantor summarized Keynesian economics with the following opinion, "The idea is that the government can be counted on to spend more wisely than the people."[40]
As Majority Leader, Cantor steered the STOCK Act through the House, which requires Congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner.[41] The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012. It was ultimately signed by President Obama on April 4, 2012.[42] In July 2012, CNN reported that changes made by the House version of the legislation excluded reporting requirements by spouses and dependent children. Initially, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act; however, when presented with new information from CNN, the Majority Leader's office recognized that changes had unintentionally been made and offered technical corrections to fulfill the original intent of the legislation.[43] These corrections were passed by Congress on August 3, 2012.[44]
As Majority Leader, Cantor shepherded the JOBS Act through the House, which combined bipartisan ideas for economic growth – like crowdfunding for startups – into one piece of legislation. Ultimately, President Obama, Eric Cantor, Steve Case and other leaders joined together at the signing ceremony.[45]
Cantor has proposed initiatives which purport to help small businesses grow, including a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that employ fewer than 500 people.[46]
Other foreign affairs[edit]
In an article he wrote for the National Review in 2007, he condemned Nancy Pelosi's diplomatic visit to Syria, and her subsequent meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, whom he referred to as a "dictator and terror-sponsor"; saying that if "Speaker Pelosi's diplomatic foray into Syria weren’t so harmful to U.S. interests in the Middle East, it would have been laughable."[47]
In 2014, Cantor criticized what he referred to as "the isolationist sentiment" and said that it was a mistake to withdraw from Iraq and had called for troops to remain in Afghanistan.[48]
During the 2016 presidential election Cantor, a supporter of Israel,[49] called on Donald Trump to be more consistent with his support for Israel.[50]

Cantor formerly represented Virginia's 7th congressional district, which stretches from the western end of Richmond, through its suburbs, and northward to Page, Rappahannock Culpeper and parts of Spotsylvania, county. It also includes the towns of Mechanicsville and Laurel. The district is strongly Republican; it has been in Republican hands since 1981 (it was numbered as the 3rd District prior to 1993).[51]
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991, winning the race for the 73rd district seat unopposed.[citation needed] He was re-elected in 1993 with 79% of the vote.[citation needed] He won re-election in 1995, 1997, and 1999; in all three races he was unopposed.[citation needed]
House of Representatives[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, succeeding retiring 20-year incumbent Republican Tom Bliley. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Warren A. Stewart, by nearly 100,000 votes.[52] Cantor had won the closely contested Republican primary over state Senator Stephen Martin by only 263 votes. During his first term, he was one of only two Jewish Republicans serving concurrently in the House of Representatives, the other being Benjamin A. Gilman of New York. Gilman retired in 2002 leaving Cantor as the only Jewish Republican House member.
In 2002, Cantor was opposed by Democrat Ben Jones, a former congressman from Georgia, who had played "Cooter Davenport" in the TV Series The Dukes of Hazzard.[53][54]
In 2004, Cantor was opposed by Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 75.5% of the vote.[citation needed] In 2006, Cantor was opposed by Democrat James M. Nachman and Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 64% to Nachman's 34% and Blanton's 2%.[citation needed]
In August 2008, news reports surfaced that Cantor was being considered as John McCain's Vice Presidential running mate, with McCain's representatives seeking documents from Cantor as part of its vetting process.[55][56][57] The idea for Cantor to be McCain's running mate was supported by conservative leaders like Richard Land and Erick Erickson.[58][59] Cantor was not selected for the vice presidential nomination, and in his 2008 re-election campaign, Cantor defeated Democratic challenger Anita Hartke 63%-37%.
In 2010, Cantor was re-elected with 59% of the vote.[60]
In 2012, Cantor faced a primary challenger, Floyd C. Bayne, in the June 12 Republican primary; Cantor won the primary with 79% of the vote[61] and then defeated Democratic challenger Wayne Powell in the general election. Although he won with 58% of the vote, Cantor received his lowest vote percentage since being elected to Congress in 2000.[citation needed]

On June 10, 2014, in a major upset, Cantor lost the Republican primary 44.5%–55.5% to Dave Brat, a Tea Party candidate and a professor at Randolph-Macon College. That made Cantor the first sitting House majority leader to lose a primary since the position was created in 1899.[62][63][64][65] Internal campaign polls before the primary showed Cantor 30 points ahead of Brat,[66] and he outspent Brat 40 to 1.[67]
Cantor's loss in the primary was described by the Los Angeles Times as "one of the greatest political upsets of modern times."[66] His loss was attributed to numerous factors including a moderating of his views after entering House leadership, being disconnected from his district, a lack of enthusiasm among his supporters, low turnout for the primary election, and support of Brat from radio talk show hosts.[68]
Although the national media were shocked at Brat's victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble.[69] The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor's constituents felt he took them for granted. The Times-Dispatch also revealed that Cantor's attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat.[70] The Chesterfield Observer, a local paper serving Chesterfield County—roughly half of which is in the 7th—reported that Tea-Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled "blood in the water."[71] One local reporter told David Carr of The New York Times that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. However, due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely under-polled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor's district, for fear that they would be out of Washington in case a major story broke.[69]
Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his resignation as House Majority Leader effective on July 31, 2014, and declared that he would not campaign for the general election. In an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 31, 2014, Cantor announced his resignation from Congress effective on August 18, 2014, and said that he had asked Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a special election on November 4, 2014 to coincide with the 2014 general election.[72][73][74]
On Tuesday, September 2, 2014, Moelis & Company announced that it was appointing Eric Cantor as vice chairman and managing director and that he would be elected to the Moelis & Company board of directors.[75]
Threats and campaign office incident[edit]
After the passage of the health care reform bill in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. A spokesman for the Richmond police later stated that the bullet was not intentionally fired at Cantor's office, saying that it was instead random gunfire, as there were no signs outside the office identifying the office as being Cantor's.[76] Cantor responded to this by saying that Democratic leaders in the House should stop "dangerously fanning the flames" by blaming Republicans for threats against House Democrats who voted for the health care legislation.[77]
Cantor also reported that he had received threatening e-mails related to the passage of the bill.[78] In March 2010, Norman Leboon was arrested for making threats against Cantor and his family.[79]
In 2011, Cantor received two threatening phone calls from Glendon Swift who left "screaming, profanity-laden messages [that] allegedly stated that he was going to destroy Cantor, rape his daughter and kill his wife." Swift was sentenced in April 2012 to 13 months in federal prison.[80]

Personal life[edit]
Cantor met his wife, Diana Marcy Fine, on a blind date; and they were married in 1989.[10][25][84] They have three children, Evan, Jenna, and Michael, and live in Wyndham, an unincorporated suburban community near Richmond (though Cantor was listed in the House roll as "R-Richmond"). Contrary to her husband, she is a lifelong, liberal Democrat, is pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage.[85]
Diana Cantor is a lawyer and certified public accountant. She founded, and from 1996 until 2008 was executive director of, the Virginia College Savings Plan (an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia). She was also chairman of the board of the College Savings Plans Network.[84][86][87] Mrs. Cantor is a managing director in a division of Emigrant Bank, a subsidiary of New York Private Bank & Trust Corp.

Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is an American politician, lawyer, and banker, who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011.
His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.[1][2]
In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company.[3]

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Cantor, the second of three children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Mary Lee (née Hudes), a schoolteacher, and Eddie Cantor, who owned a real estate firm. His family emigrated from Eastern Europe (Russia, Romania, and Latvia) in the late 1800s and early 1900s.[4][5] His father was the state treasurer for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.[6] Cantor was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4]
He graduated from the Collegiate School, a co-ed private school in Richmond, in 1981. He enrolled at George Washington University (GW) in 1981, and as a freshman he worked as an intern for House Republican Tom Bliley of Virginia and was Bliley's driver in the 1982 campaign.[7] Cantor was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at GW and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[8] He earned a Juris Doctor degree from William & Mary Law School in 1988, and received a Master of Science in Real Estate Development from Columbia University in 1989.[9]
Cantor worked for over a decade with his father's business doing legal work and real estate development.
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992–January 1, 2001.[9] At various times he was a member of committees on Science and Technology, Corporation Insurance and Banking, General Laws, Courts of Justice, (co-chairman) Claims.[10][11] Cantor announced on March 14, 2000 that he would seek the seat in the United States House of Representatives that was being vacated by Tom Bliley. Cantor had chaired Bliley's reelection campaigns for the previous six years, and immediately gained the support of Bliley's political organization, as well as Bliley's endorsement later in the primary.[12]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Committee assignments[edit]
During his first term, Cantor was chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. He has also served on the House Financial Services Committee and on the House International Relations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.
Party leadership[edit]
In 2002–only a few weeks after winning a second term–Roy Blunt appointed Cantor Chief Deputy Republican Whip, the highest appointed position in the Republican caucus.[13]

On November 19, 2008, Cantor was unanimously elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, after serving as Deputy Whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt had decided not to seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members.[1][13] Cantor became the Majority Leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011.[14] In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was considered the leader of the House Republicans.
Cantor is a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Republican National Committee. He is one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, having raised over $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).[15] He is also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program. In the fall of 2010, Cantor wrote a New York Times bestselling book, Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders, with the other two founding members of Young Guns.[16] They describe the vision outlined in the book as "a clear agenda based on common sense for the common good".[17] Cantor said in 2010 that he worked with the Tea Party movement in his district.[18]
As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 government shutdown began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.[19][20][21]
Legislation[edit]
Cantor was a strong supporter of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller's honor.[22] The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[22][23] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[22][23] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[24] Cantor said that the bill "clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions".[22]
Political positions[edit]
For much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress.[1][9][25] He supports strong United States–Israel relations.[8][9] He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.[26] Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75 million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to Palestinians.[27]
In May 2008, Cantor said that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is not a "constant sore" but rather "a constant reminder of the greatness of America",[28] and following Barack Obama's election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a "stronger U.S.–Israel relationship" remains a top priority for him and that he would be "very outspoken" if Obama "did anything to undermine those ties."[1][29] Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor's office, he "stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration" and "made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States."[30] Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy;[31] one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the President of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility "that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American 'without authority of the United States' to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government's behavior on any disputes with the United States."[32]
Social issues[edit]
Cantor opposed public funding of embryonic stem cell research and opposed elective abortion. He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record. He was also opposed to same-sex marriage as of the mid-2000s, voting to Constitutionally define marriage as between a male and a female in 2006. In November 2007 he voted against prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also supported making flag burning illegal. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated him 19% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action voting record. He was opposed to gun control, voting to ban product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers in 2005, and he voted not to require gun registration and trigger-lock laws in the District of Columbia. He had a rating of "A" from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[33] On November 2, 2010, Cantor told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that he would try to trim the federal deficit by reducing welfare.
Economy, budgeting, and trade[edit]
Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia. He also voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He voted against raising the minimum wage to US$7.25 in 2007. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the largest federation of trade unions in the United States, rates Cantor 0%, indicating an anti-Union voting record.
In October 2008, Cantor advocated and voted for the TARP program which aided distressed banks.[34]
On September 29, 2008 Cantor blamed Pelosi for what he felt was the failure of the $700 billion economic bailout bill.[35] He noted that 94 Democrats voted against the measure, as well as 133 Republicans. Though supporting the Federal bailout of the nation's largest private banks, he referred to Pelosi's proposal to appoint a Car czar to run the US Automobile Industry Bailout as a "bureaucratic" imposition on private business.[36]
The following February, Cantor led Republicans in the House of Representatives in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[37] and was a prominent spokesman in voicing the many issues he and his fellow Republicans had with the legislation. Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses,[38] despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.[39]
In his book Young Guns, Cantor summarized Keynesian economics with the following opinion, "The idea is that the government can be counted on to spend more wisely than the people."[40]
As Majority Leader, Cantor steered the STOCK Act through the House, which requires Congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner.[41] The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012. It was ultimately signed by President Obama on April 4, 2012.[42] In July 2012, CNN reported that changes made by the House version of the legislation excluded reporting requirements by spouses and dependent children. Initially, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act; however, when presented with new information from CNN, the Majority Leader's office recognized that changes had unintentionally been made and offered technical corrections to fulfill the original intent of the legislation.[43] These corrections were passed by Congress on August 3, 2012.[44]
As Majority Leader, Cantor shepherded the JOBS Act through the House, which combined bipartisan ideas for economic growth – like crowdfunding for startups – into one piece of legislation. Ultimately, President Obama, Eric Cantor, Steve Case and other leaders joined together at the signing ceremony.[45]
Cantor has proposed initiatives which purport to help small businesses grow, including a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that employ fewer than 500 people.[46]
Other foreign affairs[edit]
In an article he wrote for the National Review in 2007, he condemned Nancy Pelosi's diplomatic visit to Syria, and her subsequent meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, whom he referred to as a "dictator and terror-sponsor"; saying that if "Speaker Pelosi's diplomatic foray into Syria weren’t so harmful to U.S. interests in the Middle East, it would have been laughable."[47]
In 2014, Cantor criticized what he referred to as "the isolationist sentiment" and said that it was a mistake to withdraw from Iraq and had called for troops to remain in Afghanistan.[48]
During the 2016 presidential election Cantor, a supporter of Israel,[49] called on Donald Trump to be more consistent with his support for Israel.[50]

Cantor formerly represented Virginia's 7th congressional district, which stretches from the western end of Richmond, through its suburbs, and northward to Page, Rappahannock Culpeper and parts of Spotsylvania, county. It also includes the towns of Mechanicsville and Laurel. The district is strongly Republican; it has been in Republican hands since 1981 (it was numbered as the 3rd District prior to 1993).[51]

Cantor was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991, winning the race for the 73rd district seat unopposed.[citation needed] He was re-elected in 1993 with 79% of the vote.[citation needed] He won re-election in 1995, 1997, and 1999; in all three races he was unopposed.[citation needed]
House of Representatives[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, succeeding retiring 20-year incumbent Republican Tom Bliley. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Warren A. Stewart, by nearly 100,000 votes.[52] Cantor had won the closely contested Republican primary over state Senator Stephen Martin by only 263 votes. During his first term, he was one of only two Jewish Republicans serving concurrently in the House of Representatives, the other being Benjamin A. Gilman of New York. Gilman retired in 2002 leaving Cantor as the only Jewish Republican House member.
In 2002, Cantor was opposed by Democrat Ben Jones, a former congressman from Georgia, who had played "Cooter Davenport" in the TV Series The Dukes of Hazzard.[53][54]
In 2004, Cantor was opposed by Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 75.5% of the vote.[citation needed] In 2006, Cantor was opposed by Democrat James M. Nachman and Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 64% to Nachman's 34% and Blanton's 2%.[citation needed]
In August 2008, news reports surfaced that Cantor was being considered as John McCain's Vice Presidential running mate, with McCain's representatives seeking documents from Cantor as part of its vetting process.[55][56][57] The idea for Cantor to be McCain's running mate was supported by conservative leaders like Richard Land and Erick Erickson.[58][59] Cantor was not selected for the vice presidential nomination, and in his 2008 re-election campaign, Cantor defeated Democratic challenger Anita Hartke 63%-37%.
In 2010, Cantor was re-elected with 59% of the vote.[60]
In 2012, Cantor faced a primary challenger, Floyd C. Bayne, in the June 12 Republican primary; Cantor won the primary with 79% of the vote[61] and then defeated Democratic challenger Wayne Powell in the general election. Although he won with 58% of the vote, Cantor received his lowest vote percentage since being elected to Congress in 2000.[citation needed]
2014 Republican primary and resignation[edit]

On June 10, 2014, in a major upset, Cantor lost the Republican primary 44.5%–55.5% to Dave Brat, a Tea Party candidate and a professor at Randolph-Macon College. That made Cantor the first sitting House majority leader to lose a primary since the position was created in 1899.[62][63][64][65] Internal campaign polls before the primary showed Cantor 30 points ahead of Brat,[66] and he outspent Brat 40 to 1.[67]
Cantor's loss in the primary was described by the Los Angeles Times as "one of the greatest political upsets of modern times."[66] His loss was attributed to numerous factors including a moderating of his views after entering House leadership, being disconnected from his district, a lack of enthusiasm among his supporters, low turnout for the primary election, and support of Brat from radio talk show hosts.[68]
Although the national media were shocked at Brat's victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble.[69] The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor's constituents felt he took them for granted. The Times-Dispatch also revealed that Cantor's attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat.[70] The Chesterfield Observer, a local paper serving Chesterfield County—roughly half of which is in the 7th—reported that Tea-Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled "blood in the water."[71] One local reporter told David Carr of The New York Times that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. However, due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely under-polled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor's district, for fear that they would be out of Washington in case a major story broke.[69]
Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his resignation as House Majority Leader effective on July 31, 2014, and declared that he would not campaign for the general election. In an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 31, 2014, Cantor announced his resignation from Congress effective on August 18, 2014, and said that he had asked Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a special election on November 4, 2014 to coincide with the 2014 general election.[72][73][74]
On Tuesday, September 2, 2014, Moelis & Company announced that it was appointing Eric Cantor as vice chairman and managing director and that he would be elected to the Moelis & Company board of directors.[75]
Threats and campaign office incident[edit]
After the passage of the health care reform bill in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. A spokesman for the Richmond police later stated that the bullet was not intentionally fired at Cantor's office, saying that it was instead random gunfire, as there were no signs outside the office identifying the office as being Cantor's.[76] Cantor responded to this by saying that Democratic leaders in the House should stop "dangerously fanning the flames" by blaming Republicans for threats against House Democrats who voted for the health care legislation.[77]
Cantor also reported that he had received threatening e-mails related to the passage of the bill.[78] In March 2010, Norman Leboon was arrested for making threats against Cantor and his family.[79]
In 2011, Cantor received two threatening phone calls from Glendon Swift who left "screaming, profanity-laden messages [that] allegedly stated that he was going to destroy Cantor, rape his daughter and kill his wife." Swift was sentenced in April 2012 to 13 months in federal prison.[80]

Personal life[edit]
Cantor met his wife, Diana Marcy Fine, on a blind date; and they were married in 1989.[10][25][84] They have three children, Evan, Jenna, and Michael, and live in Wyndham, an unincorporated suburban community near Richmond (though Cantor was listed in the House roll as "R-Richmond"). Contrary to her husband, she is a lifelong, liberal Democrat, is pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage.[85]
Diana Cantor is a lawyer and certified public accountant. She founded, and from 1996 until 2008 was executive director of, the Virginia College Savings Plan (an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia). She was also chairman of the board of the College Savings Plans Network.[84][86][87] Mrs. Cantor is a managing director in a division of Emigrant Bank, a subsidiary of New York Private Bank & Trust Corp. [88]

Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is an American politician, lawyer, and banker, who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011.
His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.[1][2]
In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company.[3]

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Cantor, the second of three children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Mary Lee (née Hudes), a schoolteacher, and Eddie Cantor, who owned a real estate firm. His family emigrated from Eastern Europe (Russia, Romania, and Latvia) in the late 1800s and early 1900s.[4][5] His father was the state treasurer for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.[6] Cantor was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4]
He graduated from the Collegiate School, a co-ed private school in Richmond, in 1981. He enrolled at George Washington University (GW) in 1981, and as a freshman he worked as an intern for House Republican Tom Bliley of Virginia and was Bliley's driver in the 1982 campaign.[7] Cantor was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at GW and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[8] He earned a Juris Doctor degree from William & Mary Law School in 1988, and received a Master of Science in Real Estate Development from Columbia University in 1989.[9]
Cantor worked for over a decade with his father's business doing legal work and real estate development.
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992–January 1, 2001.[9] At various times he was a member of committees on Science and Technology, Corporation Insurance and Banking, General Laws, Courts of Justice, (co-chairman) Claims.[10][11] Cantor announced on March 14, 2000 that he would seek the seat in the United States House of Representatives that was being vacated by Tom Bliley. Cantor had chaired Bliley's reelection campaigns for the previous six years, and immediately gained the support of Bliley's political organization, as well as Bliley's endorsement later in the primary.[12]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Committee assignments[edit]
During his first term, Cantor was chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. He has also served on the House Financial Services Committee and on the House International Relations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.
Party leadership[edit]
In 2002–only a few weeks after winning a second term–Roy Blunt appointed Cantor Chief Deputy Republican Whip, the highest appointed position in the Republican caucus.[13]

On November 19, 2008, Cantor was unanimously elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, after serving as Deputy Whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt had decided not to seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members.[1][13] Cantor became the Majority Leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011.[14] In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was considered the leader of the House Republicans.
Cantor is a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Republican National Committee. He is one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, having raised over $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).[15] He is also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program. In the fall of 2010, Cantor wrote a New York Times bestselling book, Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders, with the other two founding members of Young Guns.[16] They describe the vision outlined in the book as "a clear agenda based on common sense for the common good".[17] Cantor said in 2010 that he worked with the Tea Party movement in his district.[18]
As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 government shutdown began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.[19][20][21]
Legislation[edit]
Cantor was a strong supporter of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller's honor.[22] The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[22][23] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[22][23] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[24] Cantor said that the bill "clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions".[22]
Political positions[edit]
For much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress.[1][9][25] He supports strong United States–Israel relations.[8][9] He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.[26] Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75 million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to Palestinians.[27]
In May 2008, Cantor said that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is not a "constant sore" but rather "a constant reminder of the greatness of America",[28] and following Barack Obama's election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a "stronger U.S.–Israel relationship" remains a top priority for him and that he would be "very outspoken" if Obama "did anything to undermine those ties."[1][29] Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor's office, he "stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration" and "made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States."[30] Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy;[31] one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the President of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility "that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American 'without authority of the United States' to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government's behavior on any disputes with the United States."[32]
Social issues[edit]
Cantor opposed public funding of embryonic stem cell research and opposed elective abortion. He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record. He was also opposed to same-sex marriage as of the mid-2000s, voting to Constitutionally define marriage as between a male and a female in 2006. In November 2007 he voted against prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also supported making flag burning illegal. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated him 19% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action voting record. He was opposed to gun control, voting to ban product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers in 2005, and he voted not to require gun registration and trigger-lock laws in the District of Columbia. He had a rating of "A" from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[33] On November 2, 2010, Cantor told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that he would try to trim the federal deficit by reducing welfare.
Economy, budgeting, and trade[edit]
Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia. He also voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He voted against raising the minimum wage to US$7.25 in 2007. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the largest federation of trade unions in the United States, rates Cantor 0%, indicating an anti-Union voting record.
In October 2008, Cantor advocated and voted for the TARP program which aided distressed banks.[34]
On September 29, 2008 Cantor blamed Pelosi for what he felt was the failure of the $700 billion economic bailout bill.[35] He noted that 94 Democrats voted against the measure, as well as 133 Republicans. Though supporting the Federal bailout of the nation's largest private banks, he referred to Pelosi's proposal to appoint a Car czar to run the US Automobile Industry Bailout as a "bureaucratic" imposition on private business.[36]
The following February, Cantor led Republicans in the House of Representatives in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[37] and was a prominent spokesman in voicing the many issues he and his fellow Republicans had with the legislation. Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses,[38] despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.[39]
In his book Young Guns, Cantor summarized Keynesian economics with the following opinion, "The idea is that the government can be counted on to spend more wisely than the people."[40]
As Majority Leader, Cantor steered the STOCK Act through the House, which requires Congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner.[41] The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012. It was ultimately signed by President Obama on April 4, 2012.[42] In July 2012, CNN reported that changes made by the House version of the legislation excluded reporting requirements by spouses and dependent children. Initially, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act; however, when presented with new information from CNN, the Majority Leader's office recognized that changes had unintentionally been made and offered technical corrections to fulfill the original intent of the legislation.[43] These corrections were passed by Congress on August 3, 2012.[44]
As Majority Leader, Cantor shepherded the JOBS Act through the House, which combined bipartisan ideas for economic growth – like crowdfunding for startups – into one piece of legislation. Ultimately, President Obama, Eric Cantor, Steve Case and other leaders joined together at the signing ceremony.[45]
Cantor has proposed initiatives which purport to help small businesses grow, including a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that employ fewer than 500 people.[46]
Other foreign affairs[edit]
In an article he wrote for the National Review in 2007, he condemned Nancy Pelosi's diplomatic visit to Syria, and her subsequent meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, whom he referred to as a "dictator and terror-sponsor"; saying that if "Speaker Pelosi's diplomatic foray into Syria weren’t so harmful to U.S. interests in the Middle East, it would have been laughable."[47]
In 2014, Cantor criticized what he referred to as "the isolationist sentiment" and said that it was a mistake to withdraw from Iraq and had called for troops to remain in Afghanistan.[48]
During the 2016 presidential election Cantor, a supporter of Israel,[49] called on Donald Trump to be more consistent with his support for Israel.[50]

Cantor formerly represented Virginia's 7th congressional district, which stretches from the western end of Richmond, through its suburbs, and northward to Page, Rappahannock Culpeper and parts of Spotsylvania, county. It also includes the towns of Mechanicsville and Laurel. The district is strongly Republican; it has been in Republican hands since 1981 (it was numbered as the 3rd District prior to 1993).[51]
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991, winning the race for the 73rd district seat unopposed.[citation needed] He was re-elected in 1993 with 79% of the vote.[citation needed] He won re-election in 1995, 1997, and 1999; in all three races he was unopposed.[citation needed]
House of Representatives[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, succeeding retiring 20-year incumbent Republican Tom Bliley. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Warren A. Stewart, by nearly 100,000 votes.[52] Cantor had won the closely contested Republican primary over state Senator Stephen Martin by only 263 votes. During his first term, he was one of only two Jewish Republicans serving concurrently in the House of Representatives, the other being Benjamin A. Gilman of New York. Gilman retired in 2002 leaving Cantor as the only Jewish Republican House member.
In 2002, Cantor was opposed by Democrat Ben Jones, a former congressman from Georgia, who had played "Cooter Davenport" in the TV Series The Dukes of Hazzard.[53][54]
In 2004, Cantor was opposed by Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 75.5% of the vote.[citation needed] In 2006, Cantor was opposed by Democrat James M. Nachman and Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 64% to Nachman's 34% and Blanton's 2%.[citation needed]
In August 2008, news reports surfaced that Cantor was being considered as John McCain's Vice Presidential running mate, with McCain's representatives seeking documents from Cantor as part of its vetting process.[55][56][57] The idea for Cantor to be McCain's running mate was supported by conservative leaders like Richard Land and Erick Erickson.[58][59] Cantor was not selected for the vice presidential nomination, and in his 2008 re-election campaign, Cantor defeated Democratic challenger Anita Hartke 63%-37%.
In 2010, Cantor was re-elected with 59% of the vote.[60]
In 2012, Cantor faced a primary challenger, Floyd C. Bayne, in the June 12 Republican primary; Cantor won the primary with 79% of the vote[61] and then defeated Democratic challenger Wayne Powell in the general election. Although he won with 58% of the vote, Cantor received his lowest vote percentage since being elected to Congress in 2000.[citation needed]

On June 10, 2014, in a major upset, Cantor lost the Republican primary 44.5%–55.5% to Dave Brat, a Tea Party candidate and a professor at Randolph-Macon College. That made Cantor the first sitting House majority leader to lose a primary since the position was created in 1899.[62][63][64][65] Internal campaign polls before the primary showed Cantor 30 points ahead of Brat,[66] and he outspent Brat 40 to 1.[67]
Cantor's loss in the primary was described by the Los Angeles Times as "one of the greatest political upsets of modern times."[66] His loss was attributed to numerous factors including a moderating of his views after entering House leadership, being disconnected from his district, a lack of enthusiasm among his supporters, low turnout for the primary election, and support of Brat from radio talk show hosts.[68]
Although the national media were shocked at Brat's victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble.[69] The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor's constituents felt he took them for granted. The Times-Dispatch also revealed that Cantor's attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat.[70] The Chesterfield Observer, a local paper serving Chesterfield County—roughly half of which is in the 7th—reported that Tea-Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled "blood in the water."[71] One local reporter told David Carr of The New York Times that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. However, due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely under-polled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor's district, for fear that they would be out of Washington in case a major story broke.[69]
Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his resignation as House Majority Leader effective on July 31, 2014, and declared that he would not campaign for the general election. In an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 31, 2014, Cantor announced his resignation from Congress effective on August 18, 2014, and said that he had asked Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a special election on November 4, 2014 to coincide with the 2014 general election.[72][73][74]
On Tuesday, September 2, 2014, Moelis & Company announced that it was appointing Eric Cantor as vice chairman and managing director and that he would be elected to the Moelis & Company board of directors.[75]
Threats and campaign office incident[edit]
After the passage of the health care reform bill in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. A spokesman for the Richmond police later stated that the bullet was not intentionally fired at Cantor's office, saying that it was instead random gunfire, as there were no signs outside the office identifying the office as being Cantor's.[76] Cantor responded to this by saying that Democratic leaders in the House should stop "dangerously fanning the flames" by blaming Republicans for threats against House Democrats who voted for the health care legislation.[77]
Cantor also reported that he had received threatening e-mails related to the passage of the bill.[78] In March 2010, Norman Leboon was arrested for making threats against Cantor and his family.[79]
In 2011, Cantor received two threatening phone calls from Glendon Swift who left "screaming, profanity-laden messages [that] allegedly stated that he was going to destroy Cantor, rape his daughter and kill his wife." Swift was sentenced in April 2012 to 13 months in federal prison.[80]

Personal life[edit]
Cantor met his wife, Diana Marcy Fine, on a blind date; and they were married in 1989.[10][25][84] They have three children, Evan, Jenna, and Michael, and live in Wyndham, an unincorporated suburban community near Richmond (though Cantor was listed in the House roll as "R-Richmond"). Contrary to her husband, she is a lifelong, liberal Democrat, is pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage.[85]
Diana Cantor is a lawyer and certified public accountant. She founded, and from 1996 until 2008 was executive director of, the Virginia College Savings Plan (an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia). She was also chairman of the board of the College Savings Plans Network.[84][86][87] Mrs. Cantor is a managing director in a division of Emigrant Bank, a subsidiary of New York Private Bank & Trust Corp.

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                 By Ed O'Keefe  By Ed O'Keefe   August 27, 2015  Follow @edatpost       House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) addressed reporters the day after his historic primary loss on June 11, 2014, on Capitol Hill. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Former House majority leader Eric Cantor plans to endorse the presidential campaign of Jeb Bush on Thursday evening, according to campaign aides. Cantor, who stunned the nation with his historic 2014 GOP primary loss, becomes the most high-profile Virginia Republican to back Bush to date. He will co-chair Bush's Virginia campaign along with two other party luminaries: Kay Cole James, a former Virginia health secretary, and John Hager, a former lieutenant governor and chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia. Hager's son, Henry, is married to Bush's niece, Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of George W. Bush. Cantor will formally endorse Bush on Thursday night at a Bush fundraiser in Richmond. The two will also appear together Friday at a campaign event in Norfolk. "Gov. Bush has always had tremendous respect for Congressman Cantor and is grateful for his support and endorsement," said his spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell. [Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor succumbs to tea party challenger Dave Brat] The Bush fundraiser in the Virginia capital is set to draw a who's who of Virginia Republicans, including Mark Kington, a venture capitalist who used to be business partners with Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and has been very supportive of Warner, but also Republicans; Tom Farrell, the CEO of Dominion Resources Inc., one of Virginia's largest and most powerful companies; and Richard Cullen, chairman of the McGuireWoods law firm, a major international firm that's headquartered in Richmond. He's also a long time friend of Cantor. In the past, Bush and Cantor have worked together on education reform issues -- which were a key part of Cantor's policy portfolio as a House Republican leader. In the coming months, Bush is expected to "engage" with Cantor on foreign policy and ask the Virginia Republican to serve as a lead surrogate to Jewish Americans, according to campaign aides. News of the endorsement was first reported by Politico. Cantor remains well liked and respected in the Virginia business community and among the Republican donor class in the commonwealth, though many conservative activists have little affection for him. But he remains the most senior Republican leader to succumb to a tea party challenge in recent years. Stunned by the loss, House Republicans immediately dropped plans to pursue comprehensive immigration reform, abandoned attempts to work with President Obama on other legislation and set out on a weeks-long fight among GOP lawmakers to pick a new leadership team. The Cantor endorsement comes amid a wave of announced support for Bush among local and statewide Republican officials in several states. From mayors to Florida, to state legislators in Nevada and Michigan, the candidate has picked up the endorsements despite his sagging poll numbers in early primary states and the surging campaign of businessman Donald Trump. On Capitol Hill, Bush has more public endorsements than any other presidential candidate. In recent weeks, Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) have announced that they're backing Bush. In the House, Reps. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.), Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) and a majority of the Florida Republican congressional delegation are also on board. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) is close with Bush and publicly urged him to consider a race, but isn't expected to endorse any candidate for next year's Republican National Convention. A handful of former senior House Republican aides — including former Boehner spokesman Michael Steel and Robert S. Karem, a former top policy adviser to Cantor and his successor, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) — are now top Bush campaign advisers. Rosalind S.

Eric Cantor: What the Obama Presidency Looked Like to the Opposition
He started with an outstretched hand. Then that changed.

Inauguration Day for Barack Obama in 2009 was clear, cold and crisp. More than a million people had come to Washington, and the Mall was alive with a sense of hope for the country’s future. I saw it from my seat on the west front of the Capitol. I felt the historic sense of the day and the optimism it promised as we in Congress went to work that January.Shortly before that Inauguration Day, President-elect Obama came to the Capitol to meet with the Republican and Democratic leaders to discuss how we could work together to get the economy moving again. In that meeting, Mr. Obama asked John A. Boehner, then the House minority leader, and me to provide his team with our thoughts on how to put people back to work after the severe financial crisis of 2008. Given that my party had fought hard to elect someone else to the presidency, I was struck by this gesture and hopeful that it meant we could work together.John and I established a working group on the recovery. We knew many of the traditional Republican policies had been consistently rejected by the Democrats, so we aimed to formulate policies that both sides could embrace.The centerpiece of our plan was a 20 percent reduction in taxes for small businesses. We believed that small businesses were going to be the engine that powered America out of the economic downturn.

We didn’t know how the White House would receive our plan, but we knew the president was wildly popular and could use the bully pulpit against us. Continue reading the main story

News outlets, along with the Democrats, labeled us the “Party of No.” But that didn’t reflect the reality. Our goal was to offer a viable alternative to every major piece of legislation the Democratic majority put forward. We wondered if the president would embrace our efforts to bridge the policy divide, and if he did, what that might mean for Republicans in Washington.A few weeks later, John and I, along with the other congressional leaders, met with President Obama at the White House to discuss our plan as well as his proposed stimulus bill. Bringing along a one-page outline of our working group’s recommendations, I rather brazenly asked the president if I could hand it out at the meeting. The president agreed, and after glancing at it, he said to me, “Eric, I don’t see anything crazy in here.”I was hopeful. But later in the meeting, when I mentioned that a stimulus package built around government spending would be too much like “old Washington,” the president’s tone changed. He said: “Elections have consequences, and at the end of the day, I won. So I think on that one I trump you.”It wasn’t long afterward that we learned that Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, were well on their way to having a final stimulus package drafted, and they weren’t really interested in any of our ideas.

            Arguments and reflections on the president’s tenure and legacy.        

















And so it went with the year’s next significant policy debate: health care reform. For a long time, Republicans had been working on proposals to utilize high-risk pools to help patients with pre-existing conditions, to lower overall costs, and to expand coverage in the small employer market — policies that were compatible with the president’s public goals.Early in the legislative process, a senior member of the Obama administration came to see me. Ostensibly it was to share ideas and seek a bipartisan way forward on health care reform. The official presented the administration’s preferred policy approach — including mandates, and the “public option,” in which government would compete with private insurance plans. I insisted that none of this would go over well with the Republican members, and as the whip I knew that the public option was a nonstarter. Nonetheless, I was told the president and his team were intent on doing it their way.The attitude wasn’t much different in public. In February 2010, the president invited the bipartisan congressional leadership to Blair House for a discussion surrounding the health care bill that the Senate had passed. Unlike our meeting on the economy a year earlier, this one was to be televised. It was obvious that the session was more about creating public pressure on Republicans than soliciting our ideas.

In November 2010, Democrats suffered defeat at the ballot box, as Republicans retook the majority in the House.

As I look back on that first meeting, and what transpired after, I see an opportunity lost. President Obama started with an outstretched hand, but pulled it back with a policy lurch leftward to a place we could not go.Next week, Donald J. Trump will assume office as the 45th president of the United States. He will govern with Republican majorities in the House and Senate.Democratic leaders must decide whether they will offer solutions that they hope won’t be rejected out of hand by Republicans, or whether they want to oppose everything that comes down the pike.If they choose the former, President Trump will have to decide whether to work to include them in the governing process.It is too early to say what choices each side will make, but we know what’s in store for our country if the Democrats opt for pure obstruction or if Mr. Trump and Republicans exclude the minority from policy decisions. We’ll get four years of hyper-partisanship and further erosion of public confidence in our governing institutions.As Americans witness the swearing in of a new president this week, it’s another reminder that our founding fathers wanted elections to have consequences, but they also created a system that requires factions to work together even after a decisive election. It is my hope that the new president and leaders in Congress live up to our founders’ expectations.

Eight months ago, Eric Cantor was forced out of office amid charges that he had lost touch with his Virginia constituents, derailing the political career of the man who was in line to be the first Jewish speaker of the House. 
  
 Now he’s back. 
  Story Continued Below






 At a reception Tuesday night celebrating the D.C. office opening of his investment banking firm, it was like he had never left House Republican leadership. Speaker John Boehner of Ohio held court among the guests, including now Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry of North Carolina and Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, plus a few House Democrats and a handful of GOP senators. 
  
 The high-powered event for Moelis & Co. is just the latest sign of Cantor’s reemergence as a political and fundraising force. The former House majority leader had practically dropped off the Beltway radar after unexpectedly losing his primary to tea party candidate Dave Brat. His reputation as a political savant was battered after Brat, a virtual unknown, trounced him despite Cantor outspending him by millions of dollars. 
  
 Now, Cantor is lending his name to events for 2016 candidates, reconnecting with his strong donor network, giving counsel to former colleagues and hiring advisers to brief him on political happenings on Capitol Hill. He will also be joining Harvard’s Institute of Politics as a visiting fellow in April. 
  
 The Virginia Republican has not yet decided to throw his support behind any 2016er, according to sources close to him. But he is helping possible presidential candidate New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie mingle with some of the region’s biggest donors as a co-host of a meet-and-greet Thursday at the Jefferson Hotel in downtown Richmond. 
  
 Cantor’s allies insist that his return to the Washington scene has less to do with future ambition for making another run at public service and more about how politics is in his DNA. But many Republican operatives have suggested Cantor could eye a statewide run in Virginia or be interested in an administration slot like treasury secretary. 
  
 “I think this new phase is just kind of a combination of things he knows and people he knows with a new world of business and finance,” said Rob Collins, Cantor’s former chief of staff. “I think there is a lot of goodwill that D.C. has for Eric and all he did and all he is going to do.”

 So far, Cantor, who splits his time between Washington, Richmond and New York, has kept a fairly low profile in the press except for promoting Moelis. In a statement earlier this week announcing the opening of the new office, Cantor acknowledged his experience in Washington but offered no specifics of his role. “Having spent a great deal of time in this area, I have witnessed first-hand its diverse and dynamic growth. Whether you are looking at Washington DC proper, the northern Virginia technology corridor or some very well-known companies based in Maryland, these firms need innovative, independent banking advice and Moelis & Company is well positioned to provide it.” 
  
 Veteran Republican operatives said they weren’t surprised to see Cantor, who was a regular on the cable news circuit, return to a more visible role. 
  
 The timing also makes sense for Cantor to reengage in politics after getting his sea legs in his new job, said former Virginia Republican Rep. Tom Davis, who served with Cantor in the House. 
  
 “Eric will find very quickly that you don’t have to be a member of Congress to be an influencer,” Davis said. “He’s got one of the best Republican Rolodexes in the country, with a huge donor base in Richmond. It would make sense to not just throw it out of the window. … Some people pack up their marbles and go home, but I think Eric is helping the party. Without Eric, a lot of these [donors] wouldn’t be coming to the table.” 
  
 Cantor was well-known for prolific political fundraising — building a national power base of loyal donors on Wall Street and with Jewish Republicans. And while he no longer has his sights set on being the next House speaker, his political brand still holds cachet. 
  
 His event with Christie comes after Cantor was spotted at the potential 2016 contender’s holiday party in December at the governor’s mansion, according to Christie supporters who attended.

 But Christie isn’t the only presidential hopeful who has reached out to Cantor. 
  
 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has also sought policy counsel from Cantor and is continuing to talk with him, though there is no plan for an event, according to a source familiar with conversations. 
  
 The Christie meet and greet comes just a week after Cantor was expected to headline a fundraiser, along with Jeb Bush, for a money event benefiting the Republican State Leadership Committee, also at the Jefferson Hotel. Cantor canceled because of snow, but the event still drew many of his longtime supporters, including Richard Cullen, chairman of McGuireWoods LLP and former attorney general of Virginia. 
  
 “He is eager to see the party get the best candidate to take back the White House,” Cullen said, adding that although Cantor has not declared which 2016 contender he will back, his support could be key for any of candidates. 
  
 “He would be a great person to have in your camp — he’s incredibly bright, he understands the nuances of national politics and has a great number of people who like him and might follow him.”

 Cantor remains extremely popular among wealthy Richmond-area donors still recovering from his loss. “I like Eric and believe he is good, honest and very smart and that his political loss was also a loss for our region,” said one of Cantor’s former donors, Steve Markel, vice chairman of financial holding company Markel Corp. 
  
 Another indication of Cantor’s return to Washington: Neil Bradley, who served as Cantor’s policy director, will return as a formal policy adviser. After Cantor’s defeat, he had held a similar post in McCarthy’s office. 
  
 Cantor is also staying close to his former congressional colleagues. 
  
 McHenry, who was close to the former House majority leader when they served together, said he continues to call on him for advice. 
  
 “Just as when he was in the House, he knows the process and the players and has deep knowledge on a range of policy issues. I consider him both a mentor and a friend,” the North Carolina Republican said. 
  
 Besides McHenry and other members of House GOP leadership, former colleagues who attended Moelis’ D.C. opening reception were National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden of Oregon; Republican Sens. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia; and House Democratic Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, Carolyn Maloney of New York and Peter Welch of Vermont. 
  
 Walden also said he has continued to talk with Cantor, although the Virginia Republican doesn’t have any campaign committee fundraisers on the books yet. 
  
 Cantor remains engaged with the Young Guns Network, the outside group supporting House Republicans that has ties to the former congressman and could also be helpful to 2016 congressional and presidential candidates through his leadership PAC, Every Republican Is Crucial, which is sitting on more than $425,000, based on its year-end fundraising reports. 
  
 It has not given any money to candidates since his primary loss, but the PAC continues to spend on staff salaries and vendors including Allen Consulting and Creative Direct — firms affiliated with Cantor’s former top political adviser, Ray Allen. 
  
 Allen declined to comment on the plans for the leadership PAC. 
  
 But John Murray, a former Cantor leadership aide who now works as a public relations consultant and adviser to Cantor at Moelis, said Cantor’s recent moves are just the first steps of his involvement in the upcoming cycle. 
  
 “I don’t think for a second he is going to sit out of the 2016 cycle in terms of not engaging with someone and also continuing to engage with his friends and colleagues from his former life,” he said.

Helderman and Jenna Portnoy   June 11, 2014  Follow @PostRoz Follow @jennaportnoy     Last month in Richmond, Eric Cantor stepped to a microphone in a hotel ballroom full of Republican activists from his home district. He was clearly ticked off. Cantor’s wife and two of his kids were there. His mother was there. His mother-in-law was there. And right there in front of them all, a little-known professor from a little college had just called Cantor a bad conservative. The normally cool Cantor was about to strike back — showing a pique he has turned on the president but rarely shows in public. “When I sit here and I listen to Mr. Brat speak,” Cantor started, referring to challenger Dave Brat, “I hear the inaccuracies . . .” The crowd cut him off.

Mark Wilson/Getty Images  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.           “Listen,” Cantor said, struggling to be heard. “We are about a country of free speech, so decency is also a part of this.”  Now, after Cantor’s historic defeat in the Republican primary Tuesday, an entire party is picking through the wreckage of his campaign, trying to understand what went wrong.  Some Republicans spent Wednesday working on conspiracy theories, indulging the idea that there was no way they could have seen this coming. Maybe, some said, voters secretly and suddenly turned on Cantor because he is Jewish? Or maybe it was the “Cooter Effect?” That was the theory that Cantor lost because Democrats came out to vote against him — following a plan laid out in an “open letter” from an obscure ex-congressman, Ben Jones, who played Cooter the mechanic on “The Dukes of Hazzard.” (Jones had served as a Democrat from Georgia before moving to Virginia and running unsuccessfully against Cantor in 2002.)  The answers to those questions are  likely no, and no. Instead, a look back at Cantor’s defeat shows that it was a real rejection by a broad swath of his district’s Republican voters. And there were warning signs that it was coming: the heckling of Cantor in that convention speech and defeats of his acolytes in low-level party elections this year.  But Cantor missed those signs for far too long — focusing on his ambition in the House while his base crumbled beneath him.  Then, when he realized there was some danger, he reacted clumsily: launching an ad blitz that was supposed to destroy his opponent but actually left him looking like a legitimate alternative. In the confrontational GOP culture that Cantor had helped create, the highest measure of a conservative was that powerful interests wanted to destroy him. Now, Cantor was signaling, here was such a man. “They really created their own nightmare in a lot of ways. But Eric Cantor has been creating his own nightmare for years,” said Jamie Radtke, co-founder of the Virginia Tea Party Federation and a Brat volunteer from Hanover County, Va.  Of Cantor, Radtke said, “He made an enemy of his friends.” Cantor, 51, has been in Congress for more than 13 years now. But in all that time, his only close election was his first one: the 2000 Republican primary, which he won by less than one percentage point.  Since then, he had always won big. In some years, he faced no primary opponent at all. When Virginia’s districts were redrawn in 2010, the state’s legislature altered Cantor’s district and removed some heavily Democratic precincts in the Richmond area. They swapped in heavily Republican New Kent County, east of the state capital. Cantor supported the move, which was supposed to make his safe seat even safer from Democrats. But that was a miscalculation: Cantor had misjudged where his real threat would come from.  A threat to Cantor was already growing within his own party, in which some tea party members had begun to conclude that he was not conservative enough for them. In 2010, Cantor seemed to affirm that impression, skipping the state’s first tea party “convention,” where attendees cheered lustily for his opponent. In Tuesday’s primary, the same forces unseated him — the more Republicans who showed up, the worse off it was. Those new voters from New Kent County turned sharply on Cantor, and he performed worse there than in all but one of the counties he represents.  “Ironically, New Kent was given to Cantor in redistricting to help him out. Instead, it backfired,” said Michael McDonald, a political science professor at George Mason University. When this election began, it looked like a mismatch. No majority leader, from either party, had ever been defeated in a primary. Cantor seemed unlikely to be the first: He raised more than $5 million, and outside groups also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Cantor’s behalf. Brat, 49, an economist at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va., had never held elective office before. He had little money — he raised about $200,000 — and little backing even from tea party groups.  “I mean, it’s a miracle,” Brat told Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday night, seemingly stunned at the victory himself. “First of all, I attribute it to God.” But Brat was not as helpless as he first seemed. He had key allies on conservative talk radio, like hosts Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin. They talked him up to listeners, giving Brat a free way into Virginians’ homes and cars. Ingraham also campaigned for Brat in person, holding a huge event on June 3 at a tennis and golf club not far from Cantor’s own home outside Richmond. Inside, the two-story atrium and balcony were so packed that Don Blake, chairman and president of the Virginia Christian Alliance, said he struggled to document the evening.  “It was so crowded, you could not get a decent shot. I could see her through other people. She was great. The crowd loved her,” said Blake, who didn’t endorse a candidate before the primary. He added: “She just was so personable and down to earth. She spoke from the heart.” “Who do you think Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi want to win this primary?” Ingraham asked the crowd. Cantor, the crowd replied. “Why do they want Eric Cantor to win? They want Eric Cantor to win because Eric Cantor is an ally . . . [in] the fight for immigration amnesty.” Beyond that kind of large rally, Brat’s supporters tried to set up a basic ground game, making phone calls and knocking on doors.  “Everyone assumed this race had no legs, yet we knew we had a really great candidate,” said Nancy Smith, a Brat supporter from Henrico County. “And we knew there was a lot of anti-Cantor fervor around the district.”  Smith said the volunteers found something interesting. Unlike in much of the rest of the country, the top issue for voters was not the economy, Smith explained. Life in Virginia was pretty good for most 7th District residents — the stock market was on the rise and they weren’t in financial panic mode.  But, she said, they found that many Republicans in the district were still unhappy with Cantor. He had voted to raise the debt ceiling. And he had supported a Republican version of the Dream Act, which would enable some illegal immigrants who entered the country as children to qualify for in-state college tuition rates.  “Cantor’s votes started to be the driving message,” Smith said. As months passed, there were some worrying signs for Cantor. One of his allies lost a race for the position of district Republican chairman, despite an expensive blitz from Cantor’s campaign. Cantor’s campaign paid $3 apiece in postage to send personalized trinkets to party loyalists. And on convention day, the committee bought up all the hotel’s conference rooms to stymie Brat’s supporters. They even provided day care for the kids of their own supporters.  Cantor’s candidate got beaten. And Cantor got heckled, on the same day. But, in the incumbent’s camp, they dismissed what turned out to be a major warning sign. “There were 600 people there to raise Cain,” Cantor strategist Ray Allen told The Washington Post afterward. “We had 48,000 voters in the primary two years ago. It’s just a very quantum-leap different thing.” Cantor’s team tried to reinforce its advantage with TV ads attacking Brat, calling him a liberal college professor who’d been appointed to an advisory panel by Democratic Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (Va.). Cantor spent at least $400,000 producing and airing television ads, according to federal filing reports. He began with a small buy in late April, then dramatically expanded the TV campaign in mid-May.  But the ads repeated Brat’s name again and again, alerting many voters to the fact that he existed at all — and that he seemed to threaten Cantor. To Cantor’s people, it seemed this was working. In late May, an internal poll showed Cantor ahead of Brat by 34 points, according to Cantor aides. On Wednesday, pollster John McLaughlin said the poll was flawed — but in a way that he could not have known then. In an interview, McLaughlin said the people polled were those who had voted in past Republican primaries. The poll did not anticipate that, on Tuesday, so many more people would show up. He suggested that many Democrats and others who haven’t voted in previous primaries came out on Tuesday.  “Polls don’t predict turnout. You’re trying to make assumptions of who usually votes,” McLaughlin said. “Here Eric got hit from the left and the right, and it created a large turnout.” Around the district, there was a perception among some Republicans that Cantor had grown distant.  “I wouldn’t say he’s been here a lot. And the thing is, he hadn’t had too many wide-open big events,” said Bob Arment, the chair of the Republican Party in Louisa County, Va. Arment said that when Cantor did visit his district, he tended to hold “invitation-only” events, limited to people who were already known supporters or GOP bigwigs. Arment said that voters told him “they hadn’t seen [Cantor]. They’d like to see him. When’s he coming to Louisa County?” Did that hurt Cantor in the election? “I’m sure of it,” Arment said. In the last days before that election, Cantor’s camp began to worry that not enough of its supporters would turn out. So Cantor went out to rally his people. He held meet-and-greet events at three of Richmond’s largest businesses: manufacturing firm MeadWestVaco, holding company Markel Corp. and law firm McGuireWoods.  Cantor wanted to reach his traditional core voter, persuading white-collar professionals to turn out. On the final weekend of the race, Cantor also met supporters at the homes of loyalists. But he reached only a small swath of a huge district and met largely with people who were already in his camp. “The congressman told me as he left my house — we’ll be okay if we get out the vote,” said Alan Kirshner, the chief executive of Markel Corp., who hosted a party for more than 100 Cantor supporters at his home in Doswell on Sunday. As the campaign wound down, even McLaughlin got a sense that Cantor might be in trouble. But, “by then, it’s too late to poll,” he said. Then came Tuesday itself. Cantor started the day at a Capitol Hill Starbucks, holding his monthly fundraising coffee with lobbyists around 8 a.m. In this case, he was raising money for three junior lawmakers — building the kind of loyalty that would help Cantor ascend to the speaker’s chair when John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) retired. Over coffee, Cantor assured the group of 20 or so that he would win. He had spent heavily, he told them, with the intention of getting a big margin so he would “show no sign of weakness.” Cantor went to the Capitol, where he met with Republicans in a caucus meeting. Then, as usual, he oversaw the GOP operation on the House floor. Cantor cast 12 votes, the last one at about 3 p.m. At some point in the late afternoon, Cantor headed down Interstate 95 to Richmond for his victory party. Already, the first hints of real trouble were filtering in to his campaign headquarters. Turnout was much higher than usual, his pollster said. At 7 p.m., the polls closed, and results began to come in. It was quickly apparent that Cantor would lose. A few moments later, he appeared on another hotel room stage in Richmond. “I know there’s a lot of long faces here tonight,” Cantor told the crowd. “It’s disappointing, sure. But I believe in this country. I believe there’s opportunity around the next corner for all of us.” Then he climbed into a sport-utility vehicle and left, into a life wildly divergent from the one he’d lived that morning. On Wednesday afternoon, Cantor was asked at a Capitol Hill news conference what had happened to cause his sudden fall. “You know, I’m going to leave the political analysis to y’all,” Cantor said.

Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is an American politician, lawyer, and banker, who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011.
His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.[1][2]
In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company.[3]

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Cantor, the second of three children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Mary Lee (née Hudes), a schoolteacher, and Eddie Cantor, who owned a real estate firm. His family emigrated from Eastern Europe (Russia, Romania, and Latvia) in the late 1800s and early 1900s.[4][5] His father was the state treasurer for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.[6] Cantor was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4]
He graduated from the Collegiate School, a co-ed private school in Richmond, in 1981. He enrolled at George Washington University (GW) in 1981, and as a freshman he worked as an intern for House Republican Tom Bliley of Virginia and was Bliley's driver in the 1982 campaign.[7] Cantor was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at GW and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[8] He earned a Juris Doctor degree from William & Mary Law School in 1988, and received a Master of Science in Real Estate Development from Columbia University in 1989.[9]
Cantor worked for over a decade with his father's business doing legal work and real estate development.
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992–January 1, 2001.[9] At various times he was a member of committees on Science and Technology, Corporation Insurance and Banking, General Laws, Courts of Justice, (co-chairman) Claims.[10][11] Cantor announced on March 14, 2000 that he would seek the seat in the United States House of Representatives that was being vacated by Tom Bliley. Cantor had chaired Bliley's reelection campaigns for the previous six years, and immediately gained the support of Bliley's political organization, as well as Bliley's endorsement later in the primary.[12]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Committee assignments[edit]
During his first term, Cantor was chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. He has also served on the House Financial Services Committee and on the House International Relations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.
Party leadership[edit]
In 2002–only a few weeks after winning a second term–Roy Blunt appointed Cantor Chief Deputy Republican Whip, the highest appointed position in the Republican caucus.[13]

On November 19, 2008, Cantor was unanimously elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, after serving as Deputy Whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt had decided not to seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members.[1][13] Cantor became the Majority Leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011.[14] In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was considered the leader of the House Republicans.
Cantor is a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Republican National Committee. He is one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, having raised over $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).[15] He is also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program. In the fall of 2010, Cantor wrote a New York Times bestselling book, Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders, with the other two founding members of Young Guns.[16] They describe the vision outlined in the book as "a clear agenda based on common sense for the common good".[17] Cantor said in 2010 that he worked with the Tea Party movement in his district.[18]
As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 government shutdown began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.[19][20][21]
Legislation[edit]
Cantor was a strong supporter of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller's honor.[22] The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[22][23] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[22][23] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[24] Cantor said that the bill "clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions".[22]
Political positions[edit]
For much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress.[1][9][25] He supports strong United States–Israel relations.[8][9] He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.[26] Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75 million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to Palestinians.[27]
In May 2008, Cantor said that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is not a "constant sore" but rather "a constant reminder of the greatness of America",[28] and following Barack Obama's election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a "stronger U.S.–Israel relationship" remains a top priority for him and that he would be "very outspoken" if Obama "did anything to undermine those ties."[1][29] Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor's office, he "stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration" and "made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States."[30] Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy;[31] one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the President of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility "that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American 'without authority of the United States' to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government's behavior on any disputes with the United States."[32]
Social issues[edit]
Cantor opposed public funding of embryonic stem cell research and opposed elective abortion. He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record. He was also opposed to same-sex marriage as of the mid-2000s, voting to Constitutionally define marriage as between a male and a female in 2006. In November 2007 he voted against prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also supported making flag burning illegal. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated him 19% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action voting record. He was opposed to gun control, voting to ban product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers in 2005, and he voted not to require gun registration and trigger-lock laws in the District of Columbia. He had a rating of "A" from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[33] On November 2, 2010, Cantor told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that he would try to trim the federal deficit by reducing welfare.
Economy, budgeting, and trade[edit]
Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia. He also voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He voted against raising the minimum wage to US$7.25 in 2007. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the largest federation of trade unions in the United States, rates Cantor 0%, indicating an anti-Union voting record.
In October 2008, Cantor advocated and voted for the TARP program which aided distressed banks.[34]
On September 29, 2008 Cantor blamed Pelosi for what he felt was the failure of the $700 billion economic bailout bill.[35] He noted that 94 Democrats voted against the measure, as well as 133 Republicans. Though supporting the Federal bailout of the nation's largest private banks, he referred to Pelosi's proposal to appoint a Car czar to run the US Automobile Industry Bailout as a "bureaucratic" imposition on private business.[36]
The following February, Cantor led Republicans in the House of Representatives in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[37] and was a prominent spokesman in voicing the many issues he and his fellow Republicans had with the legislation. Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses,[38] despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.[39]
In his book Young Guns, Cantor summarized Keynesian economics with the following opinion, "The idea is that the government can be counted on to spend more wisely than the people."[40]
As Majority Leader, Cantor steered the STOCK Act through the House, which requires Congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner.[41] The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012. It was ultimately signed by President Obama on April 4, 2012.[42] In July 2012, CNN reported that changes made by the House version of the legislation excluded reporting requirements by spouses and dependent children. Initially, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act; however, when presented with new information from CNN, the Majority Leader's office recognized that changes had unintentionally been made and offered technical corrections to fulfill the original intent of the legislation.[43] These corrections were passed by Congress on August 3, 2012.[44]
As Majority Leader, Cantor shepherded the JOBS Act through the House, which combined bipartisan ideas for economic growth – like crowdfunding for startups – into one piece of legislation. Ultimately, President Obama, Eric Cantor, Steve Case and other leaders joined together at the signing ceremony.[45]
Cantor has proposed initiatives which purport to help small businesses grow, including a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that employ fewer than 500 people.[46]
Other foreign affairs[edit]
In an article he wrote for the National Review in 2007, he condemned Nancy Pelosi's diplomatic visit to Syria, and her subsequent meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, whom he referred to as a "dictator and terror-sponsor"; saying that if "Speaker Pelosi's diplomatic foray into Syria weren’t so harmful to U.S. interests in the Middle East, it would have been laughable."[47]
In 2014, Cantor criticized what he referred to as "the isolationist sentiment" and said that it was a mistake to withdraw from Iraq and had called for troops to remain in Afghanistan.[48]
During the 2016 presidential election Cantor, a supporter of Israel,[49] called on Donald Trump to be more consistent with his support for Israel.[50]

Cantor formerly represented Virginia's 7th congressional district, which stretches from the western end of Richmond, through its suburbs, and northward to Page, Rappahannock Culpeper and parts of Spotsylvania, county. It also includes the towns of Mechanicsville and Laurel. The district is strongly Republican; it has been in Republican hands since 1981 (it was numbered as the 3rd District prior to 1993).[51]
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991, winning the race for the 73rd district seat unopposed.[citation needed] He was re-elected in 1993 with 79% of the vote.[citation needed] He won re-election in 1995, 1997, and 1999; in all three races he was unopposed.[citation needed]
House of Representatives[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, succeeding retiring 20-year incumbent Republican Tom Bliley. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Warren A. Stewart, by nearly 100,000 votes.[52] Cantor had won the closely contested Republican primary over state Senator Stephen Martin by only 263 votes. During his first term, he was one of only two Jewish Republicans serving concurrently in the House of Representatives, the other being Benjamin A. Gilman of New York. Gilman retired in 2002 leaving Cantor as the only Jewish Republican House member.
In 2002, Cantor was opposed by Democrat Ben Jones, a former congressman from Georgia, who had played "Cooter Davenport" in the TV Series The Dukes of Hazzard.[53][54]
In 2004, Cantor was opposed by Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 75.5% of the vote.[citation needed] In 2006, Cantor was opposed by Democrat James M. Nachman and Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 64% to Nachman's 34% and Blanton's 2%.[citation needed]
In August 2008, news reports surfaced that Cantor was being considered as John McCain's Vice Presidential running mate, with McCain's representatives seeking documents from Cantor as part of its vetting process.[55][56][57] The idea for Cantor to be McCain's running mate was supported by conservative leaders like Richard Land and Erick Erickson.[58][59] Cantor was not selected for the vice presidential nomination, and in his 2008 re-election campaign, Cantor defeated Democratic challenger Anita Hartke 63%-37%.
In 2010, Cantor was re-elected with 59% of the vote.[60]
In 2012, Cantor faced a primary challenger, Floyd C. Bayne, in the June 12 Republican primary; Cantor won the primary with 79% of the vote[61] and then defeated Democratic challenger Wayne Powell in the general election. Although he won with 58% of the vote, Cantor received his lowest vote percentage since being elected to Congress in 2000.[citation needed]
2014 Republican primary and resignation[edit]

On June 10, 2014, in a major upset, Cantor lost the Republican primary 44.5%–55.5% to Dave Brat, a Tea Party candidate and a professor at Randolph-Macon College. That made Cantor the first sitting House majority leader to lose a primary since the position was created in 1899.[62][63][64][65] Internal campaign polls before the primary showed Cantor 30 points ahead of Brat,[66] and he outspent Brat 40 to 1.[67]
Cantor's loss in the primary was described by the Los Angeles Times as "one of the greatest political upsets of modern times."[66] His loss was attributed to numerous factors including a moderating of his views after entering House leadership, being disconnected from his district, a lack of enthusiasm among his supporters, low turnout for the primary election, and support of Brat from radio talk show hosts.[68]
Although the national media were shocked at Brat's victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble.[69] The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor's constituents felt he took them for granted. The Times-Dispatch also revealed that Cantor's attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat.[70] The Chesterfield Observer, a local paper serving Chesterfield County—roughly half of which is in the 7th—reported that Tea-Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled "blood in the water."[71] One local reporter told David Carr of The New York Times that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. However, due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely under-polled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor's district, for fear that they would be out of Washington in case a major story broke.[69]
Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his resignation as House Majority Leader effective on July 31, 2014, and declared that he would not campaign for the general election. In an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 31, 2014, Cantor announced his resignation from Congress effective on August 18, 2014, and said that he had asked Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a special election on November 4, 2014 to coincide with the 2014 general election.[72][73][74]
On Tuesday, September 2, 2014, Moelis & Company announced that it was appointing Eric Cantor as vice chairman and managing director and that he would be elected to the Moelis & Company board of directors.[75]
Threats and campaign office incident[edit]
After the passage of the health care reform bill in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. A spokesman for the Richmond police later stated that the bullet was not intentionally fired at Cantor's office, saying that it was instead random gunfire, as there were no signs outside the office identifying the office as being Cantor's.[76] Cantor responded to this by saying that Democratic leaders in the House should stop "dangerously fanning the flames" by blaming Republicans for threats against House Democrats who voted for the health care legislation.[77]
Cantor also reported that he had received threatening e-mails related to the passage of the bill.[78] In March 2010, Norman Leboon was arrested for making threats against Cantor and his family.[79]
In 2011, Cantor received two threatening phone calls from Glendon Swift who left "screaming, profanity-laden messages [that] allegedly stated that he was going to destroy Cantor, rape his daughter and kill his wife." Swift was sentenced in April 2012 to 13 months in federal prison.[80]

Cantor met his wife, Diana Marcy Fine, on a blind date; and they were married in 1989.[10][25][84] They have three children, Evan, Jenna, and Michael, and live in Wyndham, an unincorporated suburban community near Richmond (though Cantor was listed in the House roll as "R-Richmond"). Contrary to her husband, she is a lifelong, liberal Democrat, is pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage.[85]

Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is an American politician, lawyer, and banker, who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011.
His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.[1][2]
In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company.[3]

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Cantor, the second of three children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Mary Lee (née Hudes), a schoolteacher, and Eddie Cantor, who owned a real estate firm. His family emigrated from Eastern Europe (Russia, Romania, and Latvia) in the late 1800s and early 1900s.[4][5] His father was the state treasurer for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.[6] Cantor was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4]
He graduated from the Collegiate School, a co-ed private school in Richmond, in 1981. He enrolled at George Washington University (GW) in 1981, and as a freshman he worked as an intern for House Republican Tom Bliley of Virginia and was Bliley's driver in the 1982 campaign.[7] Cantor was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at GW and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[8] He earned a Juris Doctor degree from William & Mary Law School in 1988, and received a Master of Science in Real Estate Development from Columbia University in 1989.[9]
Cantor worked for over a decade with his father's business doing legal work and real estate development.
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992–January 1, 2001.[9] At various times he was a member of committees on Science and Technology, Corporation Insurance and Banking, General Laws, Courts of Justice, (co-chairman) Claims.[10][11] Cantor announced on March 14, 2000 that he would seek the seat in the United States House of Representatives that was being vacated by Tom Bliley. Cantor had chaired Bliley's reelection campaigns for the previous six years, and immediately gained the support of Bliley's political organization, as well as Bliley's endorsement later in the primary.[12]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Committee assignments[edit]
During his first term, Cantor was chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. He has also served on the House Financial Services Committee and on the House International Relations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.
Party leadership[edit]
In 2002–only a few weeks after winning a second term–Roy Blunt appointed Cantor Chief Deputy Republican Whip, the highest appointed position in the Republican caucus.[13]

On November 19, 2008, Cantor was unanimously elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, after serving as Deputy Whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt had decided not to seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members.[1][13] Cantor became the Majority Leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011.[14] In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was considered the leader of the House Republicans.
Cantor is a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Republican National Committee. He is one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, having raised over $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).[15] He is also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program. In the fall of 2010, Cantor wrote a New York Times bestselling book, Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders, with the other two founding members of Young Guns.[16] They describe the vision outlined in the book as "a clear agenda based on common sense for the common good".[17] Cantor said in 2010 that he worked with the Tea Party movement in his district.[18]
As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 government shutdown began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.[19][20][21]
Legislation[edit]
Cantor was a strong supporter of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller's honor.[22] The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[22][23] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[22][23] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[24] Cantor said that the bill "clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions".[22]
Political positions[edit]
For much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress.[1][9][25] He supports strong United States–Israel relations.[8][9] He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.[26] Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75 million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to Palestinians.[27]
In May 2008, Cantor said that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is not a "constant sore" but rather "a constant reminder of the greatness of America",[28] and following Barack Obama's election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a "stronger U.S.–Israel relationship" remains a top priority for him and that he would be "very outspoken" if Obama "did anything to undermine those ties."[1][29] Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor's office, he "stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration" and "made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States."[30] Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy;[31] one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the President of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility "that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American 'without authority of the United States' to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government's behavior on any disputes with the United States."[32]
Social issues[edit]
Cantor opposed public funding of embryonic stem cell research and opposed elective abortion. He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record. He was also opposed to same-sex marriage as of the mid-2000s, voting to Constitutionally define marriage as between a male and a female in 2006. In November 2007 he voted against prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also supported making flag burning illegal. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated him 19% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action voting record. He was opposed to gun control, voting to ban product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers in 2005, and he voted not to require gun registration and trigger-lock laws in the District of Columbia. He had a rating of "A" from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[33] On November 2, 2010, Cantor told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that he would try to trim the federal deficit by reducing welfare.
Economy, budgeting, and trade[edit]
Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia. He also voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He voted against raising the minimum wage to US$7.25 in 2007. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the largest federation of trade unions in the United States, rates Cantor 0%, indicating an anti-Union voting record.
In October 2008, Cantor advocated and voted for the TARP program which aided distressed banks.[34]
On September 29, 2008 Cantor blamed Pelosi for what he felt was the failure of the $700 billion economic bailout bill.[35] He noted that 94 Democrats voted against the measure, as well as 133 Republicans. Though supporting the Federal bailout of the nation's largest private banks, he referred to Pelosi's proposal to appoint a Car czar to run the US Automobile Industry Bailout as a "bureaucratic" imposition on private business.[36]
The following February, Cantor led Republicans in the House of Representatives in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[37] and was a prominent spokesman in voicing the many issues he and his fellow Republicans had with the legislation. Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses,[38] despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.[39]
In his book Young Guns, Cantor summarized Keynesian economics with the following opinion, "The idea is that the government can be counted on to spend more wisely than the people."[40]
As Majority Leader, Cantor steered the STOCK Act through the House, which requires Congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner.[41] The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012. It was ultimately signed by President Obama on April 4, 2012.[42] In July 2012, CNN reported that changes made by the House version of the legislation excluded reporting requirements by spouses and dependent children. Initially, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act; however, when presented with new information from CNN, the Majority Leader's office recognized that changes had unintentionally been made and offered technical corrections to fulfill the original intent of the legislation.[43] These corrections were passed by Congress on August 3, 2012.[44]
As Majority Leader, Cantor shepherded the JOBS Act through the House, which combined bipartisan ideas for economic growth – like crowdfunding for startups – into one piece of legislation. Ultimately, President Obama, Eric Cantor, Steve Case and other leaders joined together at the signing ceremony.[45]
Cantor has proposed initiatives which purport to help small businesses grow, including a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that employ fewer than 500 people.[46]
Other foreign affairs[edit]
In an article he wrote for the National Review in 2007, he condemned Nancy Pelosi's diplomatic visit to Syria, and her subsequent meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, whom he referred to as a "dictator and terror-sponsor"; saying that if "Speaker Pelosi's diplomatic foray into Syria weren’t so harmful to U.S. interests in the Middle East, it would have been laughable."[47]
In 2014, Cantor criticized what he referred to as "the isolationist sentiment" and said that it was a mistake to withdraw from Iraq and had called for troops to remain in Afghanistan.[48]
During the 2016 presidential election Cantor, a supporter of Israel,[49] called on Donald Trump to be more consistent with his support for Israel.[50]

Cantor formerly represented Virginia's 7th congressional district, which stretches from the western end of Richmond, through its suburbs, and northward to Page, Rappahannock Culpeper and parts of Spotsylvania, county. It also includes the towns of Mechanicsville and Laurel. The district is strongly Republican; it has been in Republican hands since 1981 (it was numbered as the 3rd District prior to 1993).[51]
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991, winning the race for the 73rd district seat unopposed.[citation needed] He was re-elected in 1993 with 79% of the vote.[citation needed] He won re-election in 1995, 1997, and 1999; in all three races he was unopposed.[citation needed]
House of Representatives[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, succeeding retiring 20-year incumbent Republican Tom Bliley. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Warren A. Stewart, by nearly 100,000 votes.[52] Cantor had won the closely contested Republican primary over state Senator Stephen Martin by only 263 votes. During his first term, he was one of only two Jewish Republicans serving concurrently in the House of Representatives, the other being Benjamin A. Gilman of New York. Gilman retired in 2002 leaving Cantor as the only Jewish Republican House member.
In 2002, Cantor was opposed by Democrat Ben Jones, a former congressman from Georgia, who had played "Cooter Davenport" in the TV Series The Dukes of Hazzard.[53][54]
In 2004, Cantor was opposed by Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 75.5% of the vote.[citation needed] In 2006, Cantor was opposed by Democrat James M. Nachman and Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 64% to Nachman's 34% and Blanton's 2%.[citation needed]
In August 2008, news reports surfaced that Cantor was being considered as John McCain's Vice Presidential running mate, with McCain's representatives seeking documents from Cantor as part of its vetting process.[55][56][57] The idea for Cantor to be McCain's running mate was supported by conservative leaders like Richard Land and Erick Erickson.[58][59] Cantor was not selected for the vice presidential nomination, and in his 2008 re-election campaign, Cantor defeated Democratic challenger Anita Hartke 63%-37%.
In 2010, Cantor was re-elected with 59% of the vote.[60]
In 2012, Cantor faced a primary challenger, Floyd C. Bayne, in the June 12 Republican primary; Cantor won the primary with 79% of the vote[61] and then defeated Democratic challenger Wayne Powell in the general election. Although he won with 58% of the vote, Cantor received his lowest vote percentage since being elected to Congress in 2000.[citation needed]
2014 Republican primary and resignation[edit]

On June 10, 2014, in a major upset, Cantor lost the Republican primary 44.5%–55.5% to Dave Brat, a Tea Party candidate and a professor at Randolph-Macon College. That made Cantor the first sitting House majority leader to lose a primary since the position was created in 1899.[62][63][64][65] Internal campaign polls before the primary showed Cantor 30 points ahead of Brat,[66] and he outspent Brat 40 to 1.[67]
Cantor's loss in the primary was described by the Los Angeles Times as "one of the greatest political upsets of modern times."[66] His loss was attributed to numerous factors including a moderating of his views after entering House leadership, being disconnected from his district, a lack of enthusiasm among his supporters, low turnout for the primary election, and support of Brat from radio talk show hosts.[68]
Although the national media were shocked at Brat's victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble.[69] The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor's constituents felt he took them for granted. The Times-Dispatch also revealed that Cantor's attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat.[70] The Chesterfield Observer, a local paper serving Chesterfield County—roughly half of which is in the 7th—reported that Tea-Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled "blood in the water."[71] One local reporter told David Carr of The New York Times that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. However, due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely under-polled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor's district, for fear that they would be out of Washington in case a major story broke.[69]
Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his resignation as House Majority Leader effective on July 31, 2014, and declared that he would not campaign for the general election. In an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 31, 2014, Cantor announced his resignation from Congress effective on August 18, 2014, and said that he had asked Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a special election on November 4, 2014 to coincide with the 2014 general election.[72][73][74]
On Tuesday, September 2, 2014, Moelis & Company announced that it was appointing Eric Cantor as vice chairman and managing director and that he would be elected to the Moelis & Company board of directors.[75]
Threats and campaign office incident[edit]
After the passage of the health care reform bill in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. A spokesman for the Richmond police later stated that the bullet was not intentionally fired at Cantor's office, saying that it was instead random gunfire, as there were no signs outside the office identifying the office as being Cantor's.[76] Cantor responded to this by saying that Democratic leaders in the House should stop "dangerously fanning the flames" by blaming Republicans for threats against House Democrats who voted for the health care legislation.[77]
Cantor also reported that he had received threatening e-mails related to the passage of the bill.[78] In March 2010, Norman Leboon was arrested for making threats against Cantor and his family.[79]
In 2011, Cantor received two threatening phone calls from Glendon Swift who left "screaming, profanity-laden messages [that] allegedly stated that he was going to destroy Cantor, rape his daughter and kill his wife." Swift was sentenced in April 2012 to 13 months in federal prison.[80]

Personal life[edit]
Cantor met his wife, Diana Marcy Fine, on a blind date; and they were married in 1989.[10][25][84] They have three children, Evan, Jenna, and Michael, and live in Wyndham, an unincorporated suburban community near Richmond (though Cantor was listed in the House roll as "R-Richmond"). Contrary to her husband, she is a lifelong, liberal Democrat, is pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage.[85]
Diana Cantor is a lawyer and certified public accountant. She founded, and from 1996 until 2008 was executive director of, the Virginia College Savings Plan (an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia). She was also chairman of the board of the College Savings Plans Network.[84][86][87] Mrs. Cantor is a managing director in a division of Emigrant Bank, a subsidiary of New York Private Bank & Trust Corp. [88]

Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is an American politician, lawyer, and banker, who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011.
His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.[1][2]
In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company.[3]

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Cantor, the second of three children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Mary Lee (née Hudes), a schoolteacher, and Eddie Cantor, who owned a real estate firm. His family emigrated from Eastern Europe (Russia, Romania, and Latvia) in the late 1800s and early 1900s.[4][5] His father was the state treasurer for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.[6] Cantor was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4]
He graduated from the Collegiate School, a co-ed private school in Richmond, in 1981. He enrolled at George Washington University (GW) in 1981, and as a freshman he worked as an intern for House Republican Tom Bliley of Virginia and was Bliley's driver in the 1982 campaign.[7] Cantor was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at GW and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[8] He earned a Juris Doctor degree from William & Mary Law School in 1988, and received a Master of Science in Real Estate Development from Columbia University in 1989.[9]
Cantor worked for over a decade with his father's business doing legal work and real estate development.
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992–January 1, 2001.[9] At various times he was a member of committees on Science and Technology, Corporation Insurance and Banking, General Laws, Courts of Justice, (co-chairman) Claims.[10][11] Cantor announced on March 14, 2000 that he would seek the seat in the United States House of Representatives that was being vacated by Tom Bliley. Cantor had chaired Bliley's reelection campaigns for the previous six years, and immediately gained the support of Bliley's political organization, as well as Bliley's endorsement later in the primary.[12]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Committee assignments[edit]
During his first term, Cantor was chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. He has also served on the House Financial Services Committee and on the House International Relations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.
Party leadership[edit]
In 2002–only a few weeks after winning a second term–Roy Blunt appointed Cantor Chief Deputy Republican Whip, the highest appointed position in the Republican caucus.[13]

On November 19, 2008, Cantor was unanimously elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, after serving as Deputy Whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt had decided not to seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members.[1][13] Cantor became the Majority Leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011.[14] In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was considered the leader of the House Republicans.
Cantor is a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Republican National Committee. He is one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, having raised over $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).[15] He is also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program. In the fall of 2010, Cantor wrote a New York Times bestselling book, Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders, with the other two founding members of Young Guns.[16] They describe the vision outlined in the book as "a clear agenda based on common sense for the common good".[17] Cantor said in 2010 that he worked with the Tea Party movement in his district.[18]
As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 government shutdown began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.[19][20][21]
Legislation[edit]
Cantor was a strong supporter of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller's honor.[22] The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[22][23] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[22][23] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[24] Cantor said that the bill "clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions".[22]
Political positions[edit]
For much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress.[1][9][25] He supports strong United States–Israel relations.[8][9] He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.[26] Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75 million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to Palestinians.[27]
In May 2008, Cantor said that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is not a "constant sore" but rather "a constant reminder of the greatness of America",[28] and following Barack Obama's election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a "stronger U.S.–Israel relationship" remains a top priority for him and that he would be "very outspoken" if Obama "did anything to undermine those ties."[1][29] Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor's office, he "stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration" and "made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States."[30] Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy;[31] one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the President of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility "that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American 'without authority of the United States' to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government's behavior on any disputes with the United States."[32]
Social issues[edit]
Cantor opposed public funding of embryonic stem cell research and opposed elective abortion. He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record. He was also opposed to same-sex marriage as of the mid-2000s, voting to Constitutionally define marriage as between a male and a female in 2006. In November 2007 he voted against prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also supported making flag burning illegal. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated him 19% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action voting record. He was opposed to gun control, voting to ban product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers in 2005, and he voted not to require gun registration and trigger-lock laws in the District of Columbia. He had a rating of "A" from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[33] On November 2, 2010, Cantor told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that he would try to trim the federal deficit by reducing welfare.
Economy, budgeting, and trade[edit]
Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia. He also voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He voted against raising the minimum wage to US$7.25 in 2007. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the largest federation of trade unions in the United States, rates Cantor 0%, indicating an anti-Union voting record.
In October 2008, Cantor advocated and voted for the TARP program which aided distressed banks.[34]
On September 29, 2008 Cantor blamed Pelosi for what he felt was the failure of the $700 billion economic bailout bill.[35] He noted that 94 Democrats voted against the measure, as well as 133 Republicans. Though supporting the Federal bailout of the nation's largest private banks, he referred to Pelosi's proposal to appoint a Car czar to run the US Automobile Industry Bailout as a "bureaucratic" imposition on private business.[36]
The following February, Cantor led Republicans in the House of Representatives in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[37] and was a prominent spokesman in voicing the many issues he and his fellow Republicans had with the legislation. Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses,[38] despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.[39]
In his book Young Guns, Cantor summarized Keynesian economics with the following opinion, "The idea is that the government can be counted on to spend more wisely than the people."[40]
As Majority Leader, Cantor steered the STOCK Act through the House, which requires Congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner.[41] The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012. It was ultimately signed by President Obama on April 4, 2012.[42] In July 2012, CNN reported that changes made by the House version of the legislation excluded reporting requirements by spouses and dependent children. Initially, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act; however, when presented with new information from CNN, the Majority Leader's office recognized that changes had unintentionally been made and offered technical corrections to fulfill the original intent of the legislation.[43] These corrections were passed by Congress on August 3, 2012.[44]
As Majority Leader, Cantor shepherded the JOBS Act through the House, which combined bipartisan ideas for economic growth – like crowdfunding for startups – into one piece of legislation. Ultimately, President Obama, Eric Cantor, Steve Case and other leaders joined together at the signing ceremony.[45]
Cantor has proposed initiatives which purport to help small businesses grow, including a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that employ fewer than 500 people.[46]
Other foreign affairs[edit]
In an article he wrote for the National Review in 2007, he condemned Nancy Pelosi's diplomatic visit to Syria, and her subsequent meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, whom he referred to as a "dictator and terror-sponsor"; saying that if "Speaker Pelosi's diplomatic foray into Syria weren’t so harmful to U.S. interests in the Middle East, it would have been laughable."[47]
In 2014, Cantor criticized what he referred to as "the isolationist sentiment" and said that it was a mistake to withdraw from Iraq and had called for troops to remain in Afghanistan.[48]
During the 2016 presidential election Cantor, a supporter of Israel,[49] called on Donald Trump to be more consistent with his support for Israel.[50]

Cantor formerly represented Virginia's 7th congressional district, which stretches from the western end of Richmond, through its suburbs, and northward to Page, Rappahannock Culpeper and parts of Spotsylvania, county. It also includes the towns of Mechanicsville and Laurel. The district is strongly Republican; it has been in Republican hands since 1981 (it was numbered as the 3rd District prior to 1993).[51]
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991, winning the race for the 73rd district seat unopposed.[citation needed] He was re-elected in 1993 with 79% of the vote.[citation needed] He won re-election in 1995, 1997, and 1999; in all three races he was unopposed.[citation needed]
House of Representatives[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, succeeding retiring 20-year incumbent Republican Tom Bliley. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Warren A. Stewart, by nearly 100,000 votes.[52] Cantor had won the closely contested Republican primary over state Senator Stephen Martin by only 263 votes. During his first term, he was one of only two Jewish Republicans serving concurrently in the House of Representatives, the other being Benjamin A. Gilman of New York. Gilman retired in 2002 leaving Cantor as the only Jewish Republican House member.
In 2002, Cantor was opposed by Democrat Ben Jones, a former congressman from Georgia, who had played "Cooter Davenport" in the TV Series The Dukes of Hazzard.[53][54]
In 2004, Cantor was opposed by Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 75.5% of the vote.[citation needed] In 2006, Cantor was opposed by Democrat James M. Nachman and Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 64% to Nachman's 34% and Blanton's 2%.[citation needed]
In August 2008, news reports surfaced that Cantor was being considered as John McCain's Vice Presidential running mate, with McCain's representatives seeking documents from Cantor as part of its vetting process.[55][56][57] The idea for Cantor to be McCain's running mate was supported by conservative leaders like Richard Land and Erick Erickson.[58][59] Cantor was not selected for the vice presidential nomination, and in his 2008 re-election campaign, Cantor defeated Democratic challenger Anita Hartke 63%-37%.
In 2010, Cantor was re-elected with 59% of the vote.[60]
In 2012, Cantor faced a primary challenger, Floyd C. Bayne, in the June 12 Republican primary; Cantor won the primary with 79% of the vote[61] and then defeated Democratic challenger Wayne Powell in the general election. Although he won with 58% of the vote, Cantor received his lowest vote percentage since being elected to Congress in 2000.[citation needed]

On June 10, 2014, in a major upset, Cantor lost the Republican primary 44.5%–55.5% to Dave Brat, a Tea Party candidate and a professor at Randolph-Macon College. That made Cantor the first sitting House majority leader to lose a primary since the position was created in 1899.[62][63][64][65] Internal campaign polls before the primary showed Cantor 30 points ahead of Brat,[66] and he outspent Brat 40 to 1.[67]
Cantor's loss in the primary was described by the Los Angeles Times as "one of the greatest political upsets of modern times."[66] His loss was attributed to numerous factors including a moderating of his views after entering House leadership, being disconnected from his district, a lack of enthusiasm among his supporters, low turnout for the primary election, and support of Brat from radio talk show hosts.[68]
Although the national media were shocked at Brat's victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble.[69] The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor's constituents felt he took them for granted. The Times-Dispatch also revealed that Cantor's attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat.[70] The Chesterfield Observer, a local paper serving Chesterfield County—roughly half of which is in the 7th—reported that Tea-Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled "blood in the water."[71] One local reporter told David Carr of The New York Times that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. However, due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely under-polled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor's district, for fear that they would be out of Washington in case a major story broke.[69]
Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his resignation as House Majority Leader effective on July 31, 2014, and declared that he would not campaign for the general election. In an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 31, 2014, Cantor announced his resignation from Congress effective on August 18, 2014, and said that he had asked Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a special election on November 4, 2014 to coincide with the 2014 general election.[72][73][74]
On Tuesday, September 2, 2014, Moelis & Company announced that it was appointing Eric Cantor as vice chairman and managing director and that he would be elected to the Moelis & Company board of directors.[75]
Threats and campaign office incident[edit]
After the passage of the health care reform bill in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. A spokesman for the Richmond police later stated that the bullet was not intentionally fired at Cantor's office, saying that it was instead random gunfire, as there were no signs outside the office identifying the office as being Cantor's.[76] Cantor responded to this by saying that Democratic leaders in the House should stop "dangerously fanning the flames" by blaming Republicans for threats against House Democrats who voted for the health care legislation.[77]
Cantor also reported that he had received threatening e-mails related to the passage of the bill.[78] In March 2010, Norman Leboon was arrested for making threats against Cantor and his family.[79]
In 2011, Cantor received two threatening phone calls from Glendon Swift who left "screaming, profanity-laden messages [that] allegedly stated that he was going to destroy Cantor, rape his daughter and kill his wife." Swift was sentenced in April 2012 to 13 months in federal prison.[80]

Personal life[edit]
Cantor met his wife, Diana Marcy Fine, on a blind date; and they were married in 1989.[10][25][84] They have three children, Evan, Jenna, and Michael, and live in Wyndham, an unincorporated suburban community near Richmond (though Cantor was listed in the House roll as "R-Richmond"). Contrary to her husband, she is a lifelong, liberal Democrat, is pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage.[85]
Diana Cantor is a lawyer and certified public accountant. She founded, and from 1996 until 2008 was executive director of, the Virginia College Savings Plan (an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia). She was also chairman of the board of the College Savings Plans Network.[84][86][87] Mrs. Cantor is a managing director in a division of Emigrant Bank, a subsidiary of New York Private Bank & Trust Corp.

Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is an American politician, lawyer, and banker, who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011.
His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.[1][2]
In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company.[3]

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Cantor, the second of three children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Mary Lee (née Hudes), a schoolteacher, and Eddie Cantor, who owned a real estate firm. His family emigrated from Eastern Europe (Russia, Romania, and Latvia) in the late 1800s and early 1900s.[4][5] His father was the state treasurer for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.[6] Cantor was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4]
He graduated from the Collegiate School, a co-ed private school in Richmond, in 1981. He enrolled at George Washington University (GW) in 1981, and as a freshman he worked as an intern for House Republican Tom Bliley of Virginia and was Bliley's driver in the 1982 campaign.[7] Cantor was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at GW and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[8] He earned a Juris Doctor degree from William & Mary Law School in 1988, and received a Master of Science in Real Estate Development from Columbia University in 1989.[9]
Cantor worked for over a decade with his father's business doing legal work and real estate development.
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992–January 1, 2001.[9] At various times he was a member of committees on Science and Technology, Corporation Insurance and Banking, General Laws, Courts of Justice, (co-chairman) Claims.[10][11] Cantor announced on March 14, 2000 that he would seek the seat in the United States House of Representatives that was being vacated by Tom Bliley. Cantor had chaired Bliley's reelection campaigns for the previous six years, and immediately gained the support of Bliley's political organization, as well as Bliley's endorsement later in the primary.[12]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Committee assignments[edit]
During his first term, Cantor was chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. He has also served on the House Financial Services Committee and on the House International Relations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.
Party leadership[edit]
In 2002–only a few weeks after winning a second term–Roy Blunt appointed Cantor Chief Deputy Republican Whip, the highest appointed position in the Republican caucus.[13]

On November 19, 2008, Cantor was unanimously elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, after serving as Deputy Whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt had decided not to seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members.[1][13] Cantor became the Majority Leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011.[14] In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was considered the leader of the House Republicans.
Cantor is a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Republican National Committee. He is one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, having raised over $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).[15] He is also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program. In the fall of 2010, Cantor wrote a New York Times bestselling book, Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders, with the other two founding members of Young Guns.[16] They describe the vision outlined in the book as "a clear agenda based on common sense for the common good".[17] Cantor said in 2010 that he worked with the Tea Party movement in his district.[18]
As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 government shutdown began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.[19][20][21]
Legislation[edit]
Cantor was a strong supporter of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller's honor.[22] The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health.[22][23] The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years.[22][23] As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund.[24] Cantor said that the bill "clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions".[22]
Political positions[edit]
For much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress.[1][9][25] He supports strong United States–Israel relations.[8][9] He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.[26] Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75 million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to Palestinians.[27]
In May 2008, Cantor said that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is not a "constant sore" but rather "a constant reminder of the greatness of America",[28] and following Barack Obama's election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a "stronger U.S.–Israel relationship" remains a top priority for him and that he would be "very outspoken" if Obama "did anything to undermine those ties."[1][29] Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor's office, he "stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration" and "made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States."[30] Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy;[31] one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the President of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility "that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American 'without authority of the United States' to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government's behavior on any disputes with the United States."[32]
Social issues[edit]
Cantor opposed public funding of embryonic stem cell research and opposed elective abortion. He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record. He was also opposed to same-sex marriage as of the mid-2000s, voting to Constitutionally define marriage as between a male and a female in 2006. In November 2007 he voted against prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also supported making flag burning illegal. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated him 19% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action voting record. He was opposed to gun control, voting to ban product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers in 2005, and he voted not to require gun registration and trigger-lock laws in the District of Columbia. He had a rating of "A" from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[33] On November 2, 2010, Cantor told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that he would try to trim the federal deficit by reducing welfare.
Economy, budgeting, and trade[edit]
Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia. He also voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He voted against raising the minimum wage to US$7.25 in 2007. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the largest federation of trade unions in the United States, rates Cantor 0%, indicating an anti-Union voting record.
In October 2008, Cantor advocated and voted for the TARP program which aided distressed banks.[34]
On September 29, 2008 Cantor blamed Pelosi for what he felt was the failure of the $700 billion economic bailout bill.[35] He noted that 94 Democrats voted against the measure, as well as 133 Republicans. Though supporting the Federal bailout of the nation's largest private banks, he referred to Pelosi's proposal to appoint a Car czar to run the US Automobile Industry Bailout as a "bureaucratic" imposition on private business.[36]
The following February, Cantor led Republicans in the House of Representatives in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[37] and was a prominent spokesman in voicing the many issues he and his fellow Republicans had with the legislation. Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses,[38] despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.[39]
In his book Young Guns, Cantor summarized Keynesian economics with the following opinion, "The idea is that the government can be counted on to spend more wisely than the people."[40]
As Majority Leader, Cantor steered the STOCK Act through the House, which requires Congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner.[41] The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012. It was ultimately signed by President Obama on April 4, 2012.[42] In July 2012, CNN reported that changes made by the House version of the legislation excluded reporting requirements by spouses and dependent children. Initially, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act; however, when presented with new information from CNN, the Majority Leader's office recognized that changes had unintentionally been made and offered technical corrections to fulfill the original intent of the legislation.[43] These corrections were passed by Congress on August 3, 2012.[44]
As Majority Leader, Cantor shepherded the JOBS Act through the House, which combined bipartisan ideas for economic growth – like crowdfunding for startups – into one piece of legislation. Ultimately, President Obama, Eric Cantor, Steve Case and other leaders joined together at the signing ceremony.[45]
Cantor has proposed initiatives which purport to help small businesses grow, including a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that employ fewer than 500 people.[46]
Other foreign affairs[edit]
In an article he wrote for the National Review in 2007, he condemned Nancy Pelosi's diplomatic visit to Syria, and her subsequent meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, whom he referred to as a "dictator and terror-sponsor"; saying that if "Speaker Pelosi's diplomatic foray into Syria weren’t so harmful to U.S. interests in the Middle East, it would have been laughable."[47]
In 2014, Cantor criticized what he referred to as "the isolationist sentiment" and said that it was a mistake to withdraw from Iraq and had called for troops to remain in Afghanistan.[48]
During the 2016 presidential election Cantor, a supporter of Israel,[49] called on Donald Trump to be more consistent with his support for Israel.[50]

Cantor formerly represented Virginia's 7th congressional district, which stretches from the western end of Richmond, through its suburbs, and northward to Page, Rappahannock Culpeper and parts of Spotsylvania, county. It also includes the towns of Mechanicsville and Laurel. The district is strongly Republican; it has been in Republican hands since 1981 (it was numbered as the 3rd District prior to 1993).[51]
Virginia House of Delegates[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991, winning the race for the 73rd district seat unopposed.[citation needed] He was re-elected in 1993 with 79% of the vote.[citation needed] He won re-election in 1995, 1997, and 1999; in all three races he was unopposed.[citation needed]
House of Representatives[edit]
Cantor was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, succeeding retiring 20-year incumbent Republican Tom Bliley. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Warren A. Stewart, by nearly 100,000 votes.[52] Cantor had won the closely contested Republican primary over state Senator Stephen Martin by only 263 votes. During his first term, he was one of only two Jewish Republicans serving concurrently in the House of Representatives, the other being Benjamin A. Gilman of New York. Gilman retired in 2002 leaving Cantor as the only Jewish Republican House member.
In 2002, Cantor was opposed by Democrat Ben Jones, a former congressman from Georgia, who had played "Cooter Davenport" in the TV Series The Dukes of Hazzard.[53][54]
In 2004, Cantor was opposed by Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 75.5% of the vote.[citation needed] In 2006, Cantor was opposed by Democrat James M. Nachman and Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 64% to Nachman's 34% and Blanton's 2%.[citation needed]
In August 2008, news reports surfaced that Cantor was being considered as John McCain's Vice Presidential running mate, with McCain's representatives seeking documents from Cantor as part of its vetting process.[55][56][57] The idea for Cantor to be McCain's running mate was supported by conservative leaders like Richard Land and Erick Erickson.[58][59] Cantor was not selected for the vice presidential nomination, and in his 2008 re-election campaign, Cantor defeated Democratic challenger Anita Hartke 63%-37%.
In 2010, Cantor was re-elected with 59% of the vote.[60]
In 2012, Cantor faced a primary challenger, Floyd C. Bayne, in the June 12 Republican primary; Cantor won the primary with 79% of the vote[61] and then defeated Democratic challenger Wayne Powell in the general election. Although he won with 58% of the vote, Cantor received his lowest vote percentage since being elected to Congress in 2000.[citation needed]
2014 Republican primary and resignation[edit]

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2014)


On June 10, 2014, in a major upset, Cantor lost the Republican primary 44.5%–55.5% to Dave Brat, a Tea Party candidate and a professor at Randolph-Macon College. That made Cantor the first sitting House majority leader to lose a primary since the position was created in 1899.[62][63][64][65] Internal campaign polls before the primary showed Cantor 30 points ahead of Brat,[66] and he outspent Brat 40 to 1.[67]
Cantor's loss in the primary was described by the Los Angeles Times as "one of the greatest political upsets of modern times."[66] His loss was attributed to numerous factors including a moderating of his views after entering House leadership, being disconnected from his district, a lack of enthusiasm among his supporters, low turnout for the primary election, and support of Brat from radio talk show hosts.[68]
Although the national media were shocked at Brat's victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble.[69] The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor's constituents felt he took them for granted. The Times-Dispatch also revealed that Cantor's attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat.[70] The Chesterfield Observer, a local paper serving Chesterfield County—roughly half of which is in the 7th—reported that Tea-Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled "blood in the water."[71] One local reporter told David Carr of The New York Times that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. However, due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely under-polled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor's district, for fear that they would be out of Washington in case a major story broke.[69]
Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his resignation as House Majority Leader effective on July 31, 2014, and declared that he would not campaign for the general election. In an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 31, 2014, Cantor announced his resignation from Congress effective on August 18, 2014, and said that he had asked Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a special election on November 4, 2014 to coincide with the 2014 general election.[72][73][74]
On Tuesday, September 2, 2014, Moelis & Company announced that it was appointing Eric Cantor as vice chairman and managing director and that he would be elected to the Moelis & Company board of directors.[75]
Threats and campaign office incident[edit]
After the passage of the health care reform bill in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. A spokesman for the Richmond police later stated that the bullet was not intentionally fired at Cantor's office, saying that it was instead random gunfire, as there were no signs outside the office identifying the office as being Cantor's.[76] Cantor responded to this by saying that Democratic leaders in the House should stop "dangerously fanning the flames" by blaming Republicans for threats against House Democrats who voted for the health care legislation.[77]
Cantor also reported that he had received threatening e-mails related to the passage of the bill.[78] In March 2010, Norman Leboon was arrested for making threats against Cantor and his family.[79]
In 2011, Cantor received two threatening phone calls from Glendon Swift who left "screaming, profanity-laden messages [that] allegedly stated that he was going to destroy Cantor, rape his daughter and kill his wife." Swift was sentenced in April 2012 to 13 months in federal prison.[80]

Personal life[edit]
Cantor met his wife, Diana Marcy Fine, on a blind date; and they were married in 1989.[10][25][84] They have three children, Evan, Jenna, and Michael, and live in Wyndham, an unincorporated suburban community near Richmond (though Cantor was listed in the House roll as "R-Richmond"). Contrary to her husband, she is a lifelong, liberal Democrat, is pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage.[85]
Diana Cantor is a lawyer and certified public accountant. She founded, and from 1996 until 2008 was executive director of, the Virginia College Savings Plan (an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia). She was also chairman of the board of the College Savings Plans Network.[84][86][87] Mrs. Cantor is a managing director in a division of Emigrant Bank, a subsidiary of New York Private Bank & Trust Corp.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Eric Cantor Quotes

American
-
Politician

Born: June 6, 1963

I am hopeful for the American people that we can actually improve the outlook for bringing down costs in health care.
Eric Cantor


Health,
I Am,
American



















People have to take responsibility for themselves. We need to get the housing industry going again. We don't need government intervening in every step.
Eric Cantor


Responsibility,
Step,
People
























Whether it's people walking off 'The View' when Bill O'Reilly makes a statement about radical Islam or Juan Williams being fired for expressing his opinion, over-reaching political correctness is chipping away at the fundamental American freedoms of speech and expression.
Eric Cantor


Walking,
Political,
American



















In a perfect world we would bring corporate tax rates down to 25% or less so we can get competitive in the world economy. Ultimately, I would love to see a flat tax.
Eric Cantor


Love,
World,
Perfect



















We believe that if you put in place the mechanisms that allow for personal choice as far as Medicare is concerned, as well as the programs in Medicaid, that we can actually get to a better result and do what most Americans are learning how to do, which is to do more with less.
Eric Cantor


Learning,
Believe,
Better



















The issue for us is rebuilding a governing majority that is comfortable with differences that can transcend the divisiveness and unify behind the principles that we know our party has succeeded on.
Eric Cantor


Know,
Party,
Principles



















What the president announced yesterday, is that somehow magically, if we just continue to prime the pump of taxpayer dollars, we're going to see magically an economic recovery.
Eric Cantor


Yesterday,
Recovery,
See



















It is time for us to insist that we are accountable for the money that we are spending.
Eric Cantor


Time,
Money,
Accountable



















We've had Town Hall meetings, we've witnessed election after election, in which the American people have taken a position on the President's health care bill. And the bottom line is the people don't like this bill. They don't want it.
Eric Cantor


Health,
Meetings,
American
























We have a plan that creates universal access programs at the state level which allows folks to access insurance if they're denied by their insurer.
Eric Cantor


Plan,
Insurance,
Level



















I mean, look, Nancy Pelosi said in the very beginning this is going to be the most open, honest and ethical Congress in history. And what we're seeing is she's breaking that promise every day.
Eric Cantor


History,
Day,
Beginning



















And basically, the sense of the 'Pledge to America' is this: Republicans understand when we were in charge, we got fired in '06. We spent too much money. We defied the trust that the people had put in us. And we know that there is a better way.
Eric Cantor


Trust,
Money,
America



















We as Republicans understand that we have got to protect these... entitlement programs - these entitlement programs for our seniors today. And we have to sit down and have a discussion. We need more ideas on the table.
Eric Cantor


Today,
Ideas,
Down



















Look, we know we screwed up when we were in the majority. We fell in love with power. We spent way too much money - especially on earmarks. There was too much corruption when we ran this place. We were guilty. And that's why we lost.
Eric Cantor


Love,
Money,
Power



















We will cut programs, we will try to rein in the size of the bureaucracy. We will bring federal pay scales that have become so exaggerated into line with market rates.
Eric Cantor


Try,
Bureaucracy,
Line
























We know that appropriators will fight these cutbacks. But by eliminating earmarks, we can stop the horse trading that grows agency budgets.
Eric Cantor


Horse,
Fight,
Know



















Well, if Democratic members in the House elect Nancy Pelosi as their leader, it's almost as if they just didn't get the message from the voters this election. I mean, the voters outright rejected the agenda that she's been about. And here they're going to put her back in charge.
Eric Cantor


Leader,
Election,
House



















I am not for raising taxes in a recession, especially when it comes to job creators that we need so desperately to start creating jobs again.
Eric Cantor


Job,
I Am,
Start



















I mean, the Obama position has been, 'We think government ought to be spending this money, not the people who earn it.'
Eric Cantor


Money,
Government,
People



















You know, we have a fiscal train wreck before us. And unless we act, and act deliberately, we're not going to enable our kids to have what we have. It's plain and simple as that.
Eric Cantor


Simple,
Train,
Know



















It's all about the fungibility and money. If Planned Parenthood accesses hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money and they use that for other purposes, then they can use other dollars to fund abortion.
Eric Cantor


Money,
Abortion,
Then



















You know, there are people making a lot of money in this country who can actually afford their own health care. We are in a situation where we got a safety net in place in this country for people who frankly don't need one. We got to focus on making sure we got a safety net for those who actually need it.
Eric Cantor


Money,
Health,
Focus
























The Republicans have put together serious detailed counter-proposals when we have objected to this administration's agenda. And so, I want to tell the President and remind him again, we're not voting no for political expediency. We've got our principles, and we're going to stand up and defend those.
Eric Cantor


Together,
Political,
Want



















But, as we've seen over the last several months, the people in this country are very dissatisfied with the direction that this administration is taking this country. And what we heard last night was absolutely the ignoring of that fact. It was: We're going to continue with this agenda. In fact, we're going to double down on healthcare.
Eric Cantor


Night,
People,
Direction



















Now the proposal is yet again another $150 billion before we start to think about a freeze. But $150 billion spent on more government programs; monies being created to direct and what kind of jobs that Washington thinks ought to be created. Come on. I mean there is a government that can help, and the government can also hurt.
Eric Cantor


Hurt,
Government,
Start



















We believe very strongly that you stop that denial of coverage by promoting choice. Let people make the decisions.
Eric Cantor


Decisions,
Believe,
People
