Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Colorado:













Does Michelle Lynn Miller carry a valid contracting license?



General construction contractors in Colorado are not licensed by the state. You should check for license requirements at the local level. Electrical and plumbing contractors require a license to work in the state.











How important is contractor licensing in Colorado?



Colorado does not require contractors to take an exam or prove work experience, we advise homeowners to ask for multiple references when vetting a contractor to perform work on their homes.











Your liability risk when hiring Michelle Lynn Miller



Colorado does not require contractors to carry general liability insurance, but it is always a good idea to hire contractors who are covered by an active policy. Ask your contractor for copies of their policy before work starts.











Financial recourse when hiring Michelle Lynn Miller



A bond is not required in Colorado, consumers can file complaints with the Colorado Attorney General's Department of Consumer Protection.











What else should I know before hiring Michelle Lynn Miller



Colorado does not run a financial or criminal background check on contractors prior to licensing so there is more responsibility on the consumer to make the right choice. Some consumers run their own background check on the Colorado Bureau of Investigation site before hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Colorado,be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

            Michelle Carter Conviction: Friends And Family Of Victim Conrad Roy Speak Out In Text Message Killer Case                    
Fiona Miller



Michelle Carter, who urged her suicidal boyfriend to kill himself, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter yesterday. And now family and friends of Conrad Roy, the victim of her sick games, have spoken out in support of the conviction.
Roy’s high school friend, Mike Hawkins, told People that he was extremely glad she was convicted.
“I think it was a good decision — the right decision. At the end of the day, she has to live with what happened for the rest of her life. I am happy she was found guilty, because you can’t do stuff like that and expect to get away with it.”
Michelle Carter has urged ex-boyfriend, Conrad Roy, who was already struggling with suicidal thoughts, to kill himself through a series of text messages. At first, Carter acted as though she would help him rectify the situation by getting the help he needed, but then she started to tell him it was too late and that he should simply consider killing himself. She even came up with a plan for him and helped him carry it out–and then played the role of the grieving girlfriend once he was found dead. Many say that Michelle Carter’s biggest motive was attention.

Michelle Carter had texted Conrad Roy over 1,000 times, urging him to end his life.
Conrad Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, stated that she was also glad that the law came down hard on Miss Carter.
“I think she needs to be held responsible for her actions ’cause she knew exactly what she was doing,” she said during a CBS News interview.
According to Lynn Roy, she doesn’t believe that Michelle Carter has a conscience at all and that her sick games were a result of someone with something very wrong with them.
She also balked at one particular text message Michelle Carter sent her son, which stated that his friends and family would “get over him,” something that she takes great offense to. Lynn Roy stated in the interview that she will never “get over” her son.
Although the sentence has not yet been handed out, Michelle Carter faces up to 20 years in prison. It is not known if she and her team will attempt to overturn the conviction with an appeal.
Several of her teammates on the school’s softball team have stated that they are incredibly surprised to find that Michelle Carter was behind the sick game, saying that they had never seen her do a mean thing before this occurred.
Michelle Carter will be sentenced on August 3, at which point a judge will determine her fate for her involvement in Conrad Roy’s untimely death.

The recruiter did not kill Michelle, and as he died first, there is only one conclusion. Michelle took her own life.These facts are easily verifiable by contacting the Montgomery County Police Department, The Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and the U.S. Army.This listing states Adam Murdered Michelle, this is liabelous and is in error~~~Note: Dec 29 2015The following message was received from #48902704UPDATE: Medical Examiner Ruling Received in April Death InvestigationPosted on July 3, 2013On April 8, 2013, detectives from the Montgomery County Police Major Crimes Division �C Homicide and Sex Section began an investigation into two deaths that occurred in a residence in the 12900 block of Pinnacle Drive in Germantown.Officers found Adam Anthony Arndt, age 31, and Michelle Lynne Miller, age 17, deceased in the residence, each from a single gunshot wound.An extensive investigation was conducted by detectives and the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) and their forensic investigators.

 Sadie Miller is attempting to change her ways and hide somewhere no one knows her former self. She only wants to finish her final year of college, obtain her degree, and get out from the hold of her affluent parents. Then she meets Brady Carsen, the lead singer of The Invisibles, a popular local band in the college town. She tries to stay away but quickly realizes that, although he might not be what she’s used to, he’s exactly what she needs and more importantly, everything she could possibly want.  Unfortunately, Sadie’s troubled past left her with insecurities that make her question Brady’s true intentions.  And while Brady is convinced that Sadie is the one for him, he has his own secrets that he fears will be their undoing. If they want to be together, they will have to stand united and fight the outside influences that are threatening to tear them apart. Can they put their pasts behind them for good in order to secure their future?This Series is complete with 5 standalone novels. Each book can be read independently from the others, but will be more enjoyable if you read in order.Don't Let Go (#1)Let Me In (#2)Let Me Love (#3)Can't Let Go (#4)Let Me Go (#5)"Loved. It! What a great love story and not one that's like anything you've read before, I guarantee it. Brady and Sadie's relationship is one for the ages- both of them believing they are not good enough for each other because of the ghosts from their past that still haunt them but both agreeing they can't live without each other. This was one of my favorite reads this year" ~ Kellie from Eye Candy Bookstore

  She had a lot of insecurities and was a push over when it came to Brady. He waited until the end of the book to tell her ANYTHING about his life and she had already told him everything. She felt left out repeatedly because some girl who wanted her man knew the truth and was always around when things went bad for Brady's family. Yes, I would have fought for my man too if some girl thought she was going to work her way into his graces but I still would have given him heck for pushing me away and staying by the other girl. I would not have rolled over and let that go because the hero knew that the heroine did not like that other girl and whether his family had an issue or not, in no way would he treat me like trash or a fifth wheel for someone else. He deserved to be yelled at and have to grovel for his actions. I did not like it all that much.

  Here's my problem. When I was in school, I was in honors English. And in honors English you must write. A lot.  Problem is that when you write for grammatical content alone, it sounds like you are a freaking robot. There is no flow. You write as if you speak in perfectly thought-out, perfectly constructed sentences, when in fact, people use slang, contractions and colloquialisms in most everyday speech.  This book sounds like an English essay that she turned into a book. The sex scenes were painful. Effing painful. I skipped most of them after reading the first one.  And the day I skip a sex scene is the day the devil needs ice skates. I felt zero connection to the characters, the added drama of Kara was unnecessary, and the daddy issues were mediocre at best. The drama felt forced, as if they slapped some in just for added fluff.  I think this author has promise, but a good editor and beta readers would do her a world of good.

  Let me start off by saying that I could not put this book down. Sadie story and transformation was just spectacular. I wouldn't say she was weak but I would say she needed to find HERSELF and become what SHE wanted and not what was thrust upon her. I understand that being wealthy or coming from wealth may have it's ups and downs but she stood up for what she wanted and saw the flaws of her past that haunted her. Her coping mechanism wasn't ideal but it taught her a lesson in life that led her to the man in which she needed.I was touched by the story of Theo but could have choked the shit out of her dad for his arrogance and little regards for HIS family needs. It was about wealth that was gifted to him through a marriage he was not even faithful to. To cut off a child for choosing love and not money was a selfish move.Brady, OMG..... HOT, SINGER, and troubled. Wanting to save a world of people on his own and not trusty that his love will not stand by him. He was a true romantic and niave at the same time. He should have been kicked Kara to the curve and let Grant back in.I could go on about my thoughts on this book but I will let you know it is a GREAT read and I can not wait until Grant and Jessa story. I am grateful that I came across Michelle in a group and inquired about her book. 5 heart review......

  It was just okay. I didn't really connect with any of the characters, to tell you the truth. I think Sadie needs to start respecting herself. If you don't respect yourself, then who else will? In fact; she has quite a few issues to work through.Why Brady felt the need to go to some other woman to talk out his troubles, is beyond me. He tells Sadie that she's the only woman for him, but then he does this? Makes no sense, whether Sadie knew about his life problems or not. Part of being a couple is to share everything, even the bad things.

  This story 's full of drama, mystery, and yes heartbreak.Sadie is a senior in college who's recently experienced tragedy, and tried to make herself feel by sleeping with anyone who is interested. After waking up hungover in a frat house for one time too many she decides to transfer schools and escape the reputation she has built.During her first semester she meets Brady, the lead singer of a band, and a "white knight with an edge" who has secrets of his own.They both have to learn to trust again, forgive themselves, and move on from the heartbreak life has dealt them.I enjoyed reading about Sadie and Brady falling in love, and learning to put faith in someone else as well. There are a few twists in this story that might surprise you. It was definitely worth a read.
