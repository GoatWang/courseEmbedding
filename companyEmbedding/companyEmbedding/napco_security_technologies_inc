As of the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 the recurring revenue line has grown by 68% year over year and has increased 67% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. This pattern of growth has been repeated in multiple quarters over the past couple of years and the new Dual Path Series Communicator should add to the strong growth already seen. Richard Soloway, CEO of NAPCO, commented, "We are excited to have this new addition to the Starlink Fire Communicators Series. Our first Starlink Fire Communicator has been a great success thus far and we believe that the new Dual Path Communicator will experience the same pattern of rapid growth. This is an example of our efforts to produce more products that will help grow the recurring revenue business line and profits for NAPCO. Dealers and integrators are already familiar with our Starlink Communicators and this is a great addition to that product offering." About NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc.NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc. is one of the world's leading solutions providers and manufacturers of high-technology electronic security (including recurring service fee revenue), IoT connected home, video, fire alarm, access control and door locking systems.

					Full Description



NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc. (NAPCO), incorporated on December 3, 1971, is a manufacturer of security products, encompassing access control systems, door-locking products, intrusion and fire alarm systems and video surveillance products for commercial and residential use. These products are used for commercial, residential, institutional, industrial and governmental applications, and are sold across the world principally to independent distributors, dealers and installers of security equipment.The Company's access control systems consist of various types of identification readers, a control panel, a personal computer (PC)-based computer and electronically activated door-locking devices. When an identification card or other identifying information is entered into the reader, the information is transmitted to the control panel/PC, which then validates the data and determines whether or not to grant access by electronically deactivating the door locking device. An electronic log is kept, which records various types of data regarding access activity. The Company designs, engineers, manufactures and markets the software and control panels. It also buys and resells various identification readers, PC-based computers and various peripheral equipment for access control systems.NAPCO manufactures a range of door locking devices, including microprocessor-based electronic door locks with push button, card reader and bio-metric operation, door alarms, mechanical door locks and simple dead bolt locks. These devices control a single door or, in the case of some of the Company's microprocessor-based door locks, may be networked with the Company's access control systems and controlled remotely. Alarm systems consist of various detectors, a control panel, a digital keypad and signaling equipment. When a break-in occurs, an intrusion detector senses the intrusion and activates a control panel through hard-wired or wireless transmission that sets off the signaling equipment and, in various cases, causes a bell or siren to sound. Communication equipment, such as a digital communicator, is used to transmit the alarm signal to a central station or another person selected by a customer.The Company manufactures and markets various products for alarm systems, which include automatic communicators, control panels, combination control panels/digital communicators and digital keypad systems, fire alarm control panel and area detectors. When a control panel is activated by a signal from an intrusion detector, it activates a communicator that can automatically dial one or more pre-designated telephone numbers utilizing wired or cellular communications systems. If programmed to do so, a digital communicator dials the telephone number of a central monitoring station and communicates in computer language to a digital communicator receiver, which signals an alarm message. When activated by any one of the various types of intrusion detectors, the control panel can activate an audible alarm and various types of communication devices. NAPCO also manufactures multi-zone fire alarm control panels, which accommodate an optional digital communicator for reporting to a central station. Its area detectors are both passive infrared heat detectors and combination microwave/passive infrared detectors that are linked to alarm control panels. Passive infrared heat detectors respond to the change in heat patterns caused by an intruder moving within a protected area. Combination units respond to both changes in heat patterns and changes in microwave patterns occurring at the same time.Video surveillance systems consist of video cameras, a control panel and a video monitor or PC. Advanced systems can also include a recording device and some type of remote communication device, such as an Internet connection to a PC or browser-enabled cell phone. The system allows the user to monitor various locations at once while recorders save the video images. Remote communication devices can allow the user to view and control the system from a remote location. It also buys and resells various video cameras, PC-based computers and peripheral equipment for video surveillance systems. NAPCO also markets peripheral and related equipment manufactured by other companies.

STOP Security Plates
Part# STP-SP (As low as $8.75 in quantity.)
LAPTOP THEFT PREVENTION AND RECOVERYThieves Won't Steal What They Can't Sell.
A STOP Security Plate is the most cost-effective prevention, anti-theft, recovery, and asset management tag available.  Which is good, because whether your equipment is lost or stolen at the office, airport, or anywhere else, unscheduled replacement is a budget item no one enjoys revisiting.

DESCRIPTION

Effective DeterrenceThe value of your hi-tech equipment also makes it a target. STOP Security Plates significantly reduce the percentage of theft by clearly marking your equipment as an obvious liability for any would-be thief. Our patented system integrates a highly visible security plate. Under that, there's a chemically bonded tattoo, stating "Stolen Property" that even a determined thief can't remove and would find virtually impossible to explain to a potential purchaser.STOP Security Plates retain your property's value while it's under your control, but if ever stolen, the prominently displayed plate and the tattoo underneath completely remove any value on the resale market.



RecoveryThe value of STOP Security Plates goes beyond deterrence. If your equipment is just misplaced, STOP Security Plates are marked with a unique registration number that dramatically increases the incidence of recovery by providing an easy way to do the right thing.If someone finds your lost STOP-plated equipment where it shouldn't be, they simply contact STOP by phone on our 24-hour hotline or connect with us online. STOP will make the necessary arrangements to get your machine back to you quickly.

Protection that WorksWith STOP Security Plates, you'll have peace of mind knowing that the "cost of doing business" no longer includes computer theft and loss.For as little as $8.75 per unit (in quantities of 500 of more), STOP Security Plates:

Prevent theft by eliminating resale market value
Thwart both professional and casual thieves
Create unavoidable obstacles to theft
Discourage unauthorized use
Provide best opportunity for honest return
Link equipment with individual users
Facilitate recovery via our 24-hour toll-free equipment identification hotline
Provide the most cost-effective deterrence, recovery, and lifetime protection on the market!



Theft PreventionMarking or "branding" equipment in an attempt to deter   theft and improve tracking is not a new idea. The way that STOP does it is. And, the remarkable reduction in equipment losses enjoyed by our clients make it an idea worth your time!
Two sizes are available. The standard plate for computers, laptops, tablets, etc. and a smaller plate for cell phones, iPad minis, and smaller equipment.
21⁄2" x 21⁄8"2" x 3⁄4"

The only security plate in the marketAt the heart of the STOP system is our patented security plate.  Made of a tough photo-anodized aluminum, it is affixed to your equipment with cyanoacrylate adhesive so strong that removal of the security plate requires up to 800 pounds of pressure. Removal of the plate will noticeably, physically alter the case.

An indelible tattoo stops professional thievesWe don't stop there, however!  It's our unique, patented installation process that makes the STOP system so unusually effective.  During the simple do-it-yourself installation of each security plate, a permanent tattoo is chemically etched into your equipment, beneath the plate.  If someone succeeds in removing the plate (special tools are required), the indelible marking is exposed.


The unique tattoo presents a bold-type declaration that the object is "Stolen Property" and a toll-free number for verification and anti-theft information. This tattoo cannot be removed by any means without marking or defacing the case, and such a mark is recognized by police and resellers as a telltale sign that the property is stolen.


Professional thieves are not interested in equipment itself, only in its resale value on the open market. STOP's patented security plate and tattoo dramatically reduce theft by reducing the value of stolen equipment to zero.The police traceable plate and sticker deter "casual" theft.  There is more.  Each security plate bears a clear, dissuasive warning message that the property is monitored and police traceable, along with a warning that the tattoo has been etched into the equipment. Each plate also bears a unique barcode linked to the owner's tracking information, and a toll-free telephone number to call in case lost or stolen equipment is found.


Included with the standard size STOP plate is a bright red "Police Identifiable Warning Sticker" we send along for you to apply next to the plate.  Result: the guy who finds your laptop at the airport, or the employee who may have considered permanently "borrowing" an office cell phone - is highly unlikely to do so when it is clear that a 30-second check on the equipment will reveal him to be a criminal.


Marking your equipment with STOP plates makes it clear to all potential thieves that the equipment can never be shown to anyone without great risk of their facing criminal charges.

Equipment RecoverySTOP plates deliver high returns.Attaching a STOP security plate is not only the most important step you   can take in deterring theft. Our plates also connect you to our highly effective international tracking and retrieval service - the service that pushes STOP   security ahead of the rest.Numbers talk.Our return rate for lost property is unusually high.  We have successfully returned 9 out of every 10 items reported lost for the more than 2,000 companies that use the STOP system worldwide.  Given that our typical client has spent $4000 per laptop, before including the value of software, data and time spent inputting data into the machine, STOP's high reduction in losses results in significant savings!How does it work?Each STOP security plate bears a unique identifying number, along with the toll-free number for our anti-theft and ownership verification hotline.  STOP's worldwide registry links the plate i.d. number to the make, model, serial number and owner of the equipment it's affixed to.  A call to the toll-free number thus yields quick and easy ownership   verification.Our full service recovery system means you can finally relax.Misplaced computers represent more than 60 percent of lost equipment and   our service is extremely effective in returning these valuables to you.  Should you misplace your laptop, etc., experience has shown it is very likely that a fellow traveler or commuter, a service center, or whoever finds it -- will call our 800 hotline.Immediately after we've received a call locating your lost equipment, we call you to let you know where your machine is.  But we don't stop there:

We take care of returning all recovered property!Our retrieval service includes overseeing the return of your valuable   equipment - another headache you won't be suffering through once you register with STOP.


"Hot" property is returned, not resold.In any case of suspected theft, STOP will help you register the loss with local police and the FBI. We will also list the loss with INTERPOL in France, and throughout our own expanded international security network.


When the stolen equipment is offered for sale (the goal in most instances of theft), potential buyers, resellers, or whoever comes across it - typically become suspicious about the machine due to the warnings on the plate.  They call STOP's clearly marked 800 hotline and we advise them on the spot that the equipment is stolen property.  Resale is prevented and recovery follows quickly.If the computer is taken by a professional thief, who foolishly attempts to remove the security plate, the permanently etched tattoo underneath the plate displays the words "Stolen Property" in bold type, along with the toll-free number connected to our retrieval service.  Resale value for the marked item dwindles to nothing with this marking exposed.  Police and/or potential computer resellers who come across equipment stripped down to our tattoo call the 800 number and our rapid retrieval service is put into motion.  Thus, the safety of keeping or reselling a "hot" computer marked with STOP plates disappears and most are returned via our retrieval service.

Asset TrackingAs effective as STOP's security plates are in theft deterrence, the beauty of the system lies in its ability to track your organization's inventory of equipment while we protect it.  And this complete service pays for itself very quickly.The key is the security plate's barcode.  When used in combination with a hand-held barcode scanner and asset tracking software - tracking and maintaining your inventory become remarkably simple.
