(Jeffrey MacMillan/For Washington Post)   By Abha Bhattarai  By Abha Bhattarai   April 27, 2016  Follow @abhabhattarai     Thomas J. Baltimore Jr., the longtime chief executive of RLJ Lodging Trust, is returning to Hilton Worldwide to lead its new real estate spinoff, the McLean, Va.-based hotel giant announced Wednesday. Baltimore, who is resigning from Bethesda, Md.-based RLJ effective May 11, will become chief executive of Hilton’s yet-to-be-named real estate investment trust. Hilton announced in February that it plans to spin off its real estate and timeshare businesses, creating three publicly traded companies that are intended to help lower its taxes and boost value to shareholders. The real estate investment trust — which would be able to take advantage of a lower corporate tax rate — is to include about 70 properties, many of them high-end U.S. hotels. Sean M. Dell’Orto, senior vice president and treasurer at Hilton, will become chief financial officer of the spinoff when it debuts later this year. Baltimore, who co-founded RLJ with Robert L. Johnson in 2000, has been its CEO since the company went public in 2011. The real estate investment trust owns 125 hotels and has a portfolio of more than $4 billion. “It is bittersweet to be leaving RLJ Lodging Trust,” Baltimore said in a statement. “Joining Hilton Worldwide as president and CEO of their planned hotel REIT is the only opportunity within our industry that could have compelled me to make this move.” He was previously vice president of development and finance for Hilton, where he worked from 1997 to 2000. Prior to that, he worked for Marriott International and its spinoff, Host Marriott Services, and was a staff auditor for the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Ross H. Bierkan, executive vice president and chief investment officer of RLJ, will take over as the company’s interim CEO while the company’s board searches for a permanent replacement. Hilton, which oversees 13 brands, including Embassy Suites and Waldorf Astoria, on Wednesday said that its profits more than doubled during the first quarter, boosted by rising nightly rates and tax benefits. The company’s profits rose to $309 million, or 31 cents per share, during that period, up from $150 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue, meanwhile, climbed 5.8 percent to $2.6 billion. Hilton has been aggressively building new hotels around the world. As of March 31, it had an additional 1,729 properties with 281,000 rooms in the works, the most of any hotel company.          business capitalbusiness      false after3th true          Please provide a valid email address.

Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr. Announces His Resignation as President & CEO 
      of RLJ Lodging Trust to Become President & CEO of Hilton's Planned Hotel 
      REIT




RLJ Lodging Trust Board Appoints Ross Bierkan, EVP & Chief Investment 
      Officer As Interim CEO






April 27, 2016 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Robert L. Johnson, Executive Chairman of RLJ Lodging Trust 
      (NYSE:RLJ) announced today that the Board has received and accepted the 
      resignation of Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr., as President & CEO of RLJ 
      Lodging Trust. Mr. Baltimore is resigning to become President & CEO of 
      Hilton Worldwide’s planned Hotel REIT. Mr. Baltimore’s 
      resignation is effective at RLJ Lodging Trust on May 11, 2016. Mr. 
      Baltimore is a co-founder with Mr. Johnson in the creation and 
      establishment of RLJ Lodging Trust and has served as its CEO since its 
      IPO in 2011. During Mr. Baltimore’s tenure as CEO, the company has 
      achieved considerable success. RLJ Lodging Trust has become one of the 
      largest hotel REITs with 125 hotels in 21 states with nearly 21,000 
      rooms with an enterprise value in excess of $4 billion. 
      Under Mr. Baltimore’s leadership, RLJ Lodging Trust has consistently 
      focused on strong asset management, prudent capital allocation and 
      maintaining a low levered balance sheet.
    


      In response to Mr. Baltimore’s resignation, Mr. Johnson states, “On 
      behalf of RLJ Lodging Trust, I accept Tom’s decision to resign as CEO of 
      RLJ Lodging Trust. I have known Tom as a personal friend and a dynamic 
      business colleague for over 17 years. Tom, second only to Dr. John 
      Malone, is the most successful business executive and business leader 
      that I have had the good fortune to partner and work with. As CEO of RLJ 
      Lodging Trust, he has demonstrated the commitment to integrity, 
      transparency, and most of all, the ability to maximize value creation 
      for shareholders and other stakeholders in the company. His leadership 
      style helped to build RLJ Lodging Trust into a company that attracted 
      the best and brightest executive talent that I am confident will 
      continue to carry on his managerial style and business success. I 
      congratulate and wish him the very best of success in his new career 
      assignment.”
    

      Tom Baltimore, in commenting on his resignation as CEO of RLJ Lodging 
      Trust said, “It is bittersweet to be leaving RLJ Lodging Trust. It has 
      been an honor and privilege to work with and partner with Bob Johnson 
      and the incredible team of men and women assembled over the last 17 
      years. I am proud of our achievements, especially over the last 5 years 
      as a public company. I am grateful to our Board and associates for their 
      unwavering support and encouragement. Joining Hilton Worldwide as 
      President & CEO of their planned hotel REIT is the only opportunity 
      within our industry that could have compelled me to make this move. I 
      look forward to the next chapter to work with Chris Nassetta and his 
      superb team at Hilton.”
    

      Mr. Johnson also announced that the Board of Directors of RLJ Lodging 
      Trust has appointed Mr. Ross Bierkan, EVP & Chief Investment Officer, as 
      the interim CEO of RLJ Lodging Trust. Mr. Bierkan has worked with Tom 
      for the past 16 years. The Board also announced the formation of a CEO 
      search committee headed by Senator Evan Bayh, Chairman of the Governance 
      Committee, to conduct a search among internal and external candidates to 
      identify and hire a permanent CEO. The Board did not set a date for the 
      committee to commence its search.
    

      Speaking on behalf of the Board of RLJ Lodging Trust, Mr. Johnson said, 
      “Ross has been an integral part of RLJ Lodging Trust from the very 
      beginning. As EVP & Chief Investment Officer, he has been a major 
      participant and a significant contributor to the strategic development 
      and execution of the RLJ Lodging Trust success story. We are confident 
      that he will be able to motivate and orchestrate management’s execution 
      of our company goals and objectives and continue to maximize shareholder 
      value.”
    

      Commenting on Mr. Bierkan’s designation as interim CEO, Mr. Baltimore 
      said, “Ross has been a superb executive and trusted partner over the 
      last 16 years at RLJ Lodging Trust. As a seasoned hospitality executive, 
      he is experienced in hotel operations, and has led our acquisition team 
      since our launch in 2000. Ross has worked closely with every member of 
      our Executive team and our Board and has sound judgment and impeccable 
      integrity.”
    

About RLJ Lodging Trust: RLJ 
      Lodging Trust is a self-advised, publicly traded real estate investment 
      trust focused on acquiring premium-branded, focused-service and compact 
      full-service hotels. The Company owns 125 hotels with nearly 
      21,000 rooms and one planned hotel conversion across 21 states and the

Forward Looking Statements


Certain statements in this press release, other than purely 
      historical information, including estimates, projections, statements 
      relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating 
      results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are 
      "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private 
      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities 
      Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act 
      of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements generally are 
      identified by the use of the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” 
      “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “will continue,” 
      “intend,” “should,” “may” or similar expressions. Although we believe 
      that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are 
      based upon reasonable assumptions, beliefs and expectations, such 
      forward-looking statements are not predictions of future events or 
      guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ 
      materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Some 
      factors that might cause such a difference include the following: the 
      current global economic uncertainty, increased direct competition, 
      changes in government regulations or accounting rules, changes in local, 
      national and global real estate conditions, declines in the lodging 
      industry, seasonality of the lodging industry, risks related to natural
disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, hostilities, including 
      future terrorist attacks or fear of hostilities that affect travel, our 
      ability to obtain lines of credit or permanent financing on satisfactory 
      terms, changes in interest rates, access to capital through offerings of 
      our common and preferred shares of beneficial interest, or debt, our 
      ability to identify suitable acquisitions, our ability to close on 
      identified acquisitions and integrate those businesses and inaccuracies 
      of our accounting estimates. A discussion of these and other risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ 
      materially from such forward-looking statements is included in "Risk 
      Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
      Condition and Results of Operations" of the Company's Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Given these 
      uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. 
      Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or 
      revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of 
      new information, future events or otherwise.
