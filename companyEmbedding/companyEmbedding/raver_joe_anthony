The Joe Anthony Project – Rock 'n' Roll Radio. San Antonio, Texas. 1960-2015.
























Skip to content



The Joe Anthony Project
Rock 'n' Roll Radio. San Antonio, Texas. 1960-2015.

Menu















Introducing the Joe Anthony Project 

The Joe Anthony Project seeks to acquire, preserve, and present the historical memories, artifacts, and memorabilia of San Antonio’s hard rock and heavy metal community from 1960 to 2015.  While many of the physical manifestations of this community have deteriorated or disappeared over the years, a strong sense of pride and passion remains.  An active Facebook page facilitates a strong sense of community, while compilations of music playlists on YouTube ensure that the music will never die.  Building upon these existing resources, the project hopes to organize and deepen the understanding of San Antonio’s unique role in the hard rock and heavy metal world.
The Joe Anthony Project seeks to accumulate oral histories from participants broadly speaking – musicians, members of the media, and of course fans.  These will be recorded and transcribed, with their final contents posted online for widespread and easy access.  Collections of artifacts and memorabilia, from shows, radio stations, promotional events, should be also scanned and uploaded as available images.  Relevant documents must be replicated and a definitive timeline or chronology established.  Attention to concert venues and the history of musical places is another priority of the project.
Cumulatively over time, the project would become a repository that not only preserves the experience of the individual but that of the community as a whole, placing it in a broader geographical, historical, and cultural context.
A long term goal of this project would be to find a dedicated home for the material, a proper archive or library depository ideally located in San Antonio, where its physical manifestations would be open to research and preserved according to archival standards.
A further long term goal of the project should be to raise awareness of San Antonio’s contributions to hard rock and heavy metal to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio.  The Hall of Fame has small sections dedicated to hard rock and heavy metal, as well as the history of rock ‘n’ roll radio.  San Antonio is absent from any of those discussions and such a rectification should be an eventual priority of the project.
If you have any questions or wish to participate in this project please do not hesitate to reach out and connect.
