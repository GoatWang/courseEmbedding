This compensation may impact how and where products appear on this site, including, for example, the order in which they appear on category pages.

USAA itself – the parent company of these subsidiaries – is member-owned, structured under Texas law as an inter-insurance exchange. This is a cooperative model, as opposed to a traditional corporation. All members can purchase insurance through this structure. As a member who owns a slice of the company, you’re eligible to receive a share of USAA’s annual profits.Because USAA has only 20 or so offices in North America and Europe (London and Frankfurt, Germany), USAA conducts most of its business online or over the phone. If you’re a member of the military or are part of a military family, USAA is for you – literally.Eligibility: Who Can Join USAA?Though USAA has changed a lot since the 1920s, it retains an unwavering focus on its original niche: service members and their families. Unfortunately, this means that huge swathes of the U.S. population don’t qualify for membership.The following groups are eligible to join USAA:Active-Duty, Retired, and Honorably Separated Personnel. If you’re a current or former service member without a dishonorable discharge, you’re eligible for membership.Cadets and Midshipmen. This includes cadets and midshipmen at service academies and individuals participating in the ROTC program.Children of Members. Children of military personnel and their spouses can become USAA members.Current and Former Spouses of Military Personnel. If your spouse is eligible to join USAA, you are as well. This benefit continues after divorce or your spouse’s death.What Can Nonmembers Get From USAA?Even if you don’t quality for membership, you may be able to use some of USAA’s products and services, such as investment accounts, life insurance, and shopping discounts. However, other types of insurance, loans, banking products, and credit cards aren’t available to nonmembers. Since USAA’s policies regarding nonmembers are subject to change, it’s best to check with its website before attempting to purchase any of its products or services as a nonmember.Key FeaturesPersonal Banking ProductsChecking Accounts. USAA offers two checking products: Secure Checking (free) and Secure Checking Plus ($9.95 per month). Secure Checking Plus has a $50 minimum deposit and comes with an ID theft protection and credit monitoring package from Experian. This includes a quarterly credit score and report, as well as financial reimbursement of up to $1 million in the event of an identity breach. Secure Checking has a $25 minimum opening deposit. Both offer free access to 60,000 partner ATMs and free, unlimited funds transfers to any account at another institution.Savings Accounts. USAA offers two free savings accounts: USAA Savings and Performance First. Savings has a minimum opening deposit of $25 and an interest rate range of 0.1% to 0.2%. Performance First has a minimum opening deposit of $10,000 and rates between 0.1% and 0.3%. Both offer free ATM access and bank account transfers.Credit Cards. In partnership with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, USAA offers six credit cards. APRs range from about 6.9% to about 26%, depending on the card, your credit history, and current interest rates. Only one, a secured credit card, comes with an annual fee ($35). The American Express card comes with a cash back rewards program, while the Visa and MasterCard products come with travel and shopping rewards. The APRs on these four cards start at 10% and range to 26%. For a lower rate, look to the Rate Advantage MasterCard, which starts at 6.9% and ranges up to 24%.CDs. USAA offers three different types of CDs: fixed rate, variable rate, and adjustable rate. For the fixed rate, terms range from 30 days to seven years. Rates increase in proportion to the CD’s term and the amount invested, with Jumbo ($95,ooo to $174,999) and Super Jumbo ($175,000 and over) CDs boasting slightly higher yields. The variable rate CD comes with terms of 6 or 12 months, though the rate can vary based on fluctuations in prevailing consumer interest rates. However, USAA doesn’t say how the rate is recalculated or give a range that it can vary within. Finally, USAA’s adjustable rate CD comes with terms of three, four, five, and seven years, with rates ranging from .12% to .48% (depending on term length and CD size). If rates rise, you have the option to raise your CD’s rate once during its term.Investment ProductsTraditional Brokerage Accounts. You can trade stocks, ETFs, options, mutual funds, and CDs in USAA’s traditional brokerage accounts, which come with no minimum opening deposit. Online trading commissions are normally $8.95 per trade (plus $0.75 per contract for options), but you can qualify for $5.95 trades (plus $0.75 per contract) if you’ve made more than 25 trades in the past 90 days or maintain total assets of $50,000 or more in your account.Retirement Accounts. USAA offers traditional and Roth IRAs, as well as SEP IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs. These come with the same commission and fee scale as USAA’s brokerage accounts. They also offer access to USAA’s annuities, mutual funds, and managed portfolios.Managed Portfolios. You can invest in eight managed portfolios through USAA, depending on your risk appetite. Portfolios range from “conservative” (20% stocks, 80% bonds) to “very aggressive” (100% stocks). The minimum investment for all managed portfolios is $25,000. If you invest $125,000 or less, your annual management fee will be 1.10%. Above that amount, it’s less, with the exact discount dependent on what you invest – for instance, 0.85% for total assets between $250,000 and $500,000.Mutual Funds. USAA administers dozens of its own mutual funds. These range from conservative options such as money market funds and short-term bond funds, to more aggressive options such as small cap stock funds and a fund that tracks the performance of the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100. On the conservative side, expense ratios tend to be less than 1% – for instance, the USAA Government Security Fund’s ratio is 0.41%. By contrast, the small cap stock fund has an expense ratio of 1.25%. You can buy USAA-administered funds through your brokerage or retirement accounts. You also have access to 6,000 funds from other issuers (such as Vanguard and T. Rowe Price) through those accounts.Trusts. USAA offers managed trust portfolios with a minimum size of $500,000. Their assets are professionally managed by an in-house trustee and distributed to your heirs upon your death.Annuities. USAA provides immediate and deferred annuities. In exchange for a one-time investment, the immediate annuity makes fixed monthly payouts for either a preselected period (such as 10 years) or the remainder of your life. The deferred annuities allow your money to grow tax-free until you retire. APYs on the deferred annuities range from 1% to 2.5%, depending on your location and the amount invested. USAA doesn’t offer specific rate information for the immediate annuities.529 Accounts. USAA’s 529 savings accounts allow savings earmarked for higher educational expenses (such as tuition, room and board, and books and supplies) to grow without incurring a federal tax liability (if used for eligible expenses). The minimum opening deposit is $250, or $50 if you set up a recurring monthly deposit of at least $50. These products may not be available in all states, so it’s best to check with USAA first.LoansMortgage Loans. USAA offers home purchase and refinance mortgage loans. These come in five varieties: fixed rate, 5/1 adjustable rate (ARM), VA loans, FHA loans, and jumbo mortgages. All except the adjustable rate mortgage come with terms of 15 or 30 years (the 5/1 ARM is only available as a 30-year product). Rates range from Libor plus 2.5% on the 15-year VA loan, to Libor plus 4.75% on the 30-year fixed loan.Home Equity Loans. You can borrow against the value of your home with a USAA home equity line of credit. For lines between $25,000 (the minimum amount) and $75,000, rates range between Libor plus 4.25% and Libor plus 8.25%, depending on your credit score and whether you choose a fixed (higher starting rate) or variable rate. For lines of more than $75,000, rates range between Libor plus 4.25% and Libor plus 7.75%. Your line can be up to 80% of the value of your home. All USAA home equity lines of credit come with a five-year draw period, during which you can request funds and only pay back the accrued interest, and a 15-year repayment period, during which you must repay the borrowed amount in its entirety, plus interest.Auto Loans. USAA offers three types of auto loans: new car, used car, and refinance. New car loan APRs start at 1.39% and increase from there, with the exact rate depending on your credit history and your location (USAA doesn’t provide an upper range). Used car APRs start at 2.49% and increase from there. Both come with a 0.5% discount for those who use USAA’s Buying Service, which helps buyers locate and purchase vehicles. The company’s refinance loans start at 1.39% for cars less than two years old and 2.49% for cars older than that.Other Vehicle Loans. USAA also offers loans on RVs, boats, and motorcycles. Rates on these loans start around 4%, depending on the vehicle type, your credit history, and location.Personal Loans. USAA provides unsecured personal loans in amounts as low as $2,500. Rates start at 10% and go up from there, depending on your credit score and the amount of the loan. The company doesn’t provide an upper limit for its rates or principal amounts, but its lending standards get stricter as the principal increases.InsuranceAuto Insurance. USAA offers auto insurance to members in all 50 U.S. states and some overseas jurisdictions (typically where the U.S. military has a presence). Perks of this product include a 15% discount for policyholders who store their vehicles on-base, and an installment payment option that can be tailored to military pay scales. For instance, officers-in-training may be able to defer some of their premiums until they earn their higher paying officer commissions.Other Vehicle Insurance. The company also offers insurance on other vehicles, including boats, RVs, motorcycles, planes, and classic cars.Home and Property Insurance. USAA offers several types of insurance for your home and property: homeowners’ insurance, renters insurance, and rental/investment property insurance (for landlords).Flood Insurance. Through a subsidiary, USAA General Indemnity Company, USAA offers flood insurance policies underwritten by the National Flood Insurance Program. There are two types of policies: Standard for homeowners in high-risk areas, and the lower-cost Preferred Risk for homeowners in low- to medium-risk areas. Both policies offer up to $250,000 in coverage for your home and up to $100,000 in coverage for the home’s contents.Life Insurance. USAA administers four different life insurance products: military term (for members of the military only), level term (for everyone else), universal life, and whole life. Both term life products come with terms of as little as 10 years and as long as 30 years. Premiums vary by age, location, and policy size. Both the universal and whole policies build cash value over time, which you can borrow against. Unlike most life insurance policies issued to civilians, USAA’s policies don’t limit or withhold death benefits in the event that the policyholder dies in a violent conflict. With a USAA policy, your payout is the same whether you die of natural causes or in a war zone.Health Insurance. The USAA Health Insurance Marketplace lets members choose from a variety of health, dental, vision, long-term care, and other policies offered by private insurance companies (such as Cigna) and the military’s TRICARE health insurance system. USAA doesn’t actually administer these plans itself, but its members may secure lower premiums on them due to the company’s negotiating power.Umbrella Insurance. USAA’s umbrella insurance policies offer additional protection for problems that might not be covered by other types of insurance, such as legal and judgment costs if you’re sued for libel or slander. The standard coverage amount is $1 million.Other Products and ServicesCar Buying Services and Benefits. USAA’s website has a powerful car-finding feature, similar to what you’d find on AutoTrader or Cars.com, that lets you find your preferred vehicle make and model at a dealer in your area. USAA also has a network of USAA Preferred Dealers that offers special car-buying discounts (according to USAA, these range from $3,000 to $4,500 off MSRP for new cars). And if you buy a vehicle through one and then find a lower advertised price at another dealer within four days of purchase, USAA will refund the difference.Credit Monitoring and Identity Protection. Whether or not they have a financial account with the company, USAA members can purchase two different credit monitoring and ID protection packages: CreditCheck Monitoring ($5.95 per month, also included in Secure Premium Checking Account) and CreditCheck Monitoring Premium ($12.95 per month). The cheaper plan comes with one credit score and one report per month from Experian, while the more expensive plan offers the same frequency of scores and reports from Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. (These plans are different than the quarterly Experian report and score package offered with the Secure Checking Plus bank account.) Both also offer historical reports and fraud investigation services.MoversAdvantage. USAA has a network of affiliated real estate agents called “USAA Preferred Agents.” As a member, you’re entitled to a cash back bonus when you close on a new home through one of these agents. This ranges from $350 on homes worth $100,000 or less, to $6,000 on homes worth $1 million or more.Shopping and Service Discounts. USAA offers discounts on products and services through partnerships with individual companies. For instance, members get special deals (USAA doesn’t specify how much) on home security systems with ADT, storage systems with PODS, and flowers with FTD.Subscriber’s Account Distributions and AllocationsEvery member who purchases a USAA insurance policy receives a Subscriber’s Account. Administered by the company’s board of directors, this account holds a portion of USAA’s capital reserves. This is a key feature of USAA’s legal structure: As a cooperative organization, every member literally owns a piece of the company, and the Subscriber’s Account represents that ownership.Your Subscriber’s Account balance is proportional to the total amount of insurance premiums you’ve paid, with a percentage of each premium payment deposited into the account. The percentage is determined by the board of directors, may vary year to year, and isn’t public. This is USAA’s money, so you can’t withdraw it. But if the company turns a profit and meets financial performance goals set by the board of directors (variable from year to year), it may distribute a portion of your Subscriber’s Account balance to you (by paper check or direct deposit into your USAA bank account) in December of each year. The distribution amount varies from year to year and is based on the company’s financial performance, your account balance, and your lifetime premium payments.Once you’ve been a member for 40 years, you become eligible for an additional Senior Bonus, payable in February of each year. The amount of this extra bonus is subject to the same conditions as the regular bonus.Advantages1. Huge Range of Products and Services Under One RoofCompared to many other financial institutions that do the bulk of their business online, USAA offers an impressive lineup of products and services: most types of insurance, brokerage and retirement accounts, checking and savings accounts, and several types of loans. It also offers value-added perks like rebates on auto and home purchases, discounts on other purchases, and ID theft protection.With USAA, it’s possible to take care of most or all of you financial needs under one roof. By contrast, Capital One 360 offers lots of banking products and access to an online brokerage in Sharebuilder, but no loans or insurance products. Allstate provides a similarly comprehensive range of insurance products, but no banking or brokerage accounts.2. Life Insurance Policies Don’t Include a War ClauseUSAA life insurance policies don’t withhold or restrict death benefits for policyholders who die in war or violent conflict. If you’re an active-duty servicemember who dies in overseas fighting, your family will receive the same benefits as if you had died peacefully on U.S. soil. By contrast, most other life insurance issuers limit payouts in cases of conflict-related death. Active-duty servicemembers who face overseas deployment may have to pay higher premiums.3. The Potential for Annual Profit Distributions to MembersIn addition to rebates and discounts on auto and home insurance and other purchases, USAA returns capital to its members in other ways. When you buy an insurance policy from the company, you automatically receive a Subscriber’s Account that holds a portion of USAA’s capital. If the company meets the annual financial performance goals set by the board of directors, you’re entitled to receive an annual payout from this amount that could range from a few dollars to several hundred.If you’ve been a member for more than 40 years, you’re entitled to an even juicier annual payout. Most traditional insurance companies, such as Allstate and Progressive, aren’t member-owned and thus don’t offer annual distributions to members.4. Access to Flood InsuranceThe FEMA-run National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) underwrites all flood insurance policies issued in the United States, so many insurance companies (including powerhouses such as Allstate and Geico) don’t bother to offer their customers the opportunity to obtain flood insurance, instead directing them to NFIP. By contrast, USAA’s members can buy NFIP-underwritten policies directly through one of the company’s subsidiaries. This allows you to conduct all your insurance business through one insurer.5. Trading Discounts Are AttractiveUSAA offers attractive trading commission discounts for brokerage accountholders who trade often and in higher amounts. But they’re not prohibitive for people who aren’t made of money and don’t make multiple trades per day. With a discount of $3 per trade (to $5.95) when you make more than 25 trades in a 90-day period or carry an account balance of $50,000, USAA’s brokerage is a better deal than TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE, and other online brokerages with a similar range of offerings.Disadvantages1. Many Products Aren’t Available to NonmembersSince it restricts membership to military personnel and qualifying family members, USAA’s full product lineup isn’t available to most Americans. As a nonmember, you may be eligible to open a brokerage account, purchase life insurance, and take advantage of its shopping discounts. But USAA reserves the right to close these services to nonmembers, so it’s best to check with the company before making a decision. Eligibility is much less restrictive at insurance providers and financial institutions that aren’t member-owned, such as Allstate and Capital One 360.2. CD and Savings Rates Aren’t Competitive Relative to Other Online BanksUSAA’s CD and savings account rates tend to be on the low end, especially compared to online banks like Ally Bank and EverBank. Most rates on USAA’s CDs with multi-year terms range between 0.45% and 0.8%, and the highest available USAA CD yield is 1.11% on a seven-year Super Jumbo CD (which requires a $175,000 minimum deposit).By contrast, Ally Bank offers an 18-month CD at about the same rate – and with no minimum deposit. Also, its five-year CD yields 2%.3. Customer Service Is Cumbersome and ConfusingUSAA has live customer service professionals, but reaching them can be tricky. Though there’s a main number – (210) 531-USAA – with a touch-tone menu to direct you to the right department, the sheer number of departments makes this time-consuming. So USAA advises you to call your desired division (IRAs, mortgage, auto loans, and so on) directly.However, this requires you to look up the pertinent number in its online directory, which can also take time. And since its offices are closed on the weekend, calling on Monday can be stressful and time-consuming – so much so that USAA advises members to call Tuesday through Friday instead. By contrast, Ally Bank’s customer service team is available 24/7, by phone, often with wait times of just a few minutes.Separately, USAA doesn’t have a live chat feature on its website – if you don’t want to call, you need to email a customer service professional and wait hours (or days, depending on volume) for a response. Ally and other online banks have live web chat.4. Website Is Dense and Difficult to NavigateUSAA’s website is difficult to navigate, and its most important parts – including drop-down menus – are clogged with small text. This makes it difficult to use on a mobile device. Also, some of the site’s pages seem out of step with web browser navigation tools. For instance, when you click the back button from a sub-page, you may be taken all the way back to the home page, even if you hadn’t been there in some time.Final WordServing in the military is an honorable calling that demands tremendous sacrifice. If you’re an active-duty, retired, or honorably separated servicemember, or are related to someone who fits that bill, you may be eligible for membership in USAA. With perks that aren’t available through many other banks and insurance companies, there are plenty of reasons to join.However, USAA isn’t for everyone, as only a handful of its products are available to nonmembers. And though the company has flirted with expanding eligibility requirements in the past, including a brief period when it welcomed employees of the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies, it appears likely to prioritize its core constituency – the military – for the foreseeable future.VerdictUSAA has a wide range of insurance and financial products available online. It also offers support for members looking to save money on the purchase of a house, car, and various other services. But with restrictive eligibility requirements, it’s not an option for most Americans. And since you’re likely to do most of your business with USAA online, it would be nice if they invested more in the website, customer service, and other aspects of the user experience.Score4.3 out of 5 stars (for eligible members): Comprehensive offerings and lots of support for car-, home-, and service-buyers are big pluses here. Poor website navigation and confusing customer service definitely hurt.Have you had any experiences with USAA?Related11.2K Views10 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInVERDICTUSAAScore: out of 5 starsBrian MartucciBrian Martucci is a blogger-journalist who writes about frugal living, entrepreneurship, and innovative ideas.

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

Mutual Funds $45

FeesUSAA Brokerage fees
Promotion linkUSAA Brokerage promotions


            
            We begin our 2017 USAA Investments review with pricing and minimums. The broker's commission on stock and ETF trades is $8.95. Mutual
            funds are priced at $45 to buy, sell, or exchange. Options contracts are $0.75 each plus $8.95 trade ticket.
               
            
            There is no minimum deposit requirement to open USAA brokerage accounts as well as no minimum account balance requirements. Broker does not charge
            maintenance or inactivity fees for all accounts.
            
USAA Brokerage New Account Setup 
            USAA brokerage accounts can be created without having to deposit funds first or pass USAA member eligibility. When user creates an account, he or she 
            will be asked how much they want to invest, and if they are not ready to deposit funds, they can enter "0" and proceed. 
            
USAA Mutual Funds 

            USAA offers clients around 50 in total of their own mutual funds in a variety of fund categories including Equity (primarily growth funds), Index (stock exchange indices), 
            Taxable Bond, Tax-Exempt Bond, Money Market (capital preservation funds), Asset Allocation (for one-stop diversification shopping), 
            and Target Retirement Funds (based on user's projected retirement date, adjusts the proportions and distribution of investments across stocks and bonds).
            

            It's not easy to decide which mutual fund to choose: they have different performance, portfolio composition, and expenses. We did
            the research and below list the top performing USAA mutual funds in the most popular categories:
            

Best USAA mutual funds
Best USAA index funds

USAA Brokerage Website/Trading Platform/Tools 
Website

            USAA brokerage offers stock and mutual fund screeners, interactive chart data, detailed company information and summaries, 
            as well as interactive retirement and investment calculators. Though the firm have made significant gains to improve these tools in recent years, 
            overall, we would rate their tools and resources as average to slightly below-average.
            
            The stock and mutual fund screeners are simple to use but a little user-unfriendly if trying to make quick modifications or corrections to the 
            search criteria. The interactive charts provide good information but lack the substance to gain a quick and concise understanding of the 
            company or product being examined. It seems all the right content is there for a user to use but the overall feel of the resources would be best 
            described as slightly disorganized. 
            


Advanced Trading Platform
            Unfortunately, USAA investment services does not offer professional level trading platform which is available at many online brokers, 
            such as TD Ameritrade, Etrade, Charles Schwab, and Interactive Brokers.
            
Mobile Trading
            USAA mobile smartphone application is available for iPhone, Windows, Android and Amazon Fire. It allows clients to see real-time quotes, 
            place trades, read articles, watch videos related to investing, and deposit checks directly into eligible investment accounts. The app is rated
            very highly by the users in Google Play and iTunes stores: 4.5 stars out of 5.
            


USAA Investments Pros

Very few fees comparing to some other brokerage firms
Excellent mobile app
No account maintenance, inactivity or hidden fees
Good banking services
No-fee IRA accounts


USAA Investments Cons

Higher than average commissions
Additional $0.01 per share is charged for stocks priced under $1
Basic trading tools
Few educational resources
Limited research services


Summary
            USAA investment services is offering commissions that are higher than the average in the industry: $8.95 per trade on stocks and ETFs,
            and $45 per mutual fund transaction. However, USAA's own mutual funds can be traded commission free.
            

            USAA brokerage doesn't have surcharges on extended hours trading or large orders, but does charge additional $0.01 for each share on stocks priced under $1. There are no account maintenance or inactivity fees for both IRA and
            non-IRA accounts. In general, the company has very few fees when compared to multi-page lists of fees at some other brokerage houses. The list 
            of all USAA brokerage fees is located here.
            

            USAA is not a firm for traders looking for sophisticated trading tools or investors looking for varied investment research from multiple
            sources. Their trading tools are basic and the company does not offer an advanced trading platform found at many competitors. 
             

            USAA is known for competitive banking services and insurance products which are available not 
            just to military and their families but also to the general public. The services include completely free checking account, low rates on car insurance,
            as well as credit cards with cash, gas and groceries awards.
            

            To summarize USAA Brokerage review: higher than average commissions make the company a good option only to investors who 
            want to complement USAA's excellent banking and insurance products with an ability to invest in mutual funds, stocks and ETFs.

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
