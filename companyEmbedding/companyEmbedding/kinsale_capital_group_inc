Welcome
Kinsale Capital Partners is a Relationship Based Merchant Bank  focused on providing Equity Solutions to middle market companies located  in the U.S., Eastern China and parts of Western Europe and South  America.
Kinsale invests its own capital, along with  co-investment capital provided by Kinsale's proprietary network of  co-investors, in situations requiring short to medium term equity  capital support and which meet Kinsale's underwriting criteria.
Rather than limiting its investment focus to a  few specific industries, Kinsale focuses on investment situations  having one or more of the following critical investment characteristics:

The capital need is for growth, restructuring, ownership transition or special situations
The Company serves a market that is  growing, or the Company's share of the market is growing, and the  Company's market niche or the Company's market penetration is  well-established
The Company has an established and growing customer base
The Company has assets (which could be financial, tangible or intangible) that are significantly undervalued or underperforming
The Company's product or services are  based on technologies which are well established and for which there is  meaningful demand and additional value can be created through  operational improvements or efficiencies

In addition to meeting one or more of the foregoing critical investment characteristics, Kinsale requires that all of the following underwriting criteria are met:

Kinsale, together with its Advisory Team, must have knowledge, experience or special insight into the industry or market in which the Company competes such that Kinsale will be positioned to add value as well as capital into the Company
The Company must have an effective and proven Management Team, or have agreed to accept a new Management Team approved by Kinsale, capable of preparing and executing a Long Term Strategy Plan
Kinsale and the Company shall have agreed on a short term and medium term Action Plan consistent with the Long Term Strategy Plan
The Company has in place, or is willing to commit to, strict financial controls, comprehensive financial reporting on a regular basis, transparency and good governance practices
Our Team and Advisory Board collectively have Long Term Relationships across a wide range of industries, with People we Know, Respect, and Trust.  
These relationships are the source of deal flow, industry knowledge and co-investment capital.

We operate in a number of ways:

We Acquire Businesses in conjunction with our Investor Partners
We Provide Capital, through Private Placements, or partnering with the appropriate Investor. 
We bring Management or Industry Expertise when the situation warrants. 
We provide Advice and Creativity...and we Stay Involved, to Avoid Future Problems and Build Value

Kinsale provides Senior Level Attention, Honesty, Transparency and Integrity.
