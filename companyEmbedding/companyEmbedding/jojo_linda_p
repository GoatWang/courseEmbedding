Exelon Appoints Linda P. Jojo to Board of Directors




Chief Information Officer for United Airlines brings extensive 
      leadership and technology experience to the board






September 11, 2015 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Exelon today announced that its board of directors elected Linda P. Jojo 
      as a director. Jojo, 50, is Executive Vice President and Chief 
      Information Officer for United Airlines, where she is responsible for 
      technology strategy and IT operations.
    


      “Linda brings a depth of leadership experience to the Exelon board of 
      directors, and we look forward to working with her,” said Mayo Shattuck, 
      chairman of Exelon. “Technology and innovation are essential components 
      of our business and her extensive background in this area will be a 
      tremendous asset.”
    

      In her role at United Airlines, Jojo is deploying innovative mobile 
      technologies and data analytics platforms to improve customer experience 
      and airline operations, and making significant investments to improve 
      the reliability and security of the airline’s technology platforms.
    

      Prior to United Airlines, Jojo served from 2011 to 2014 as CIO at 
      Toronto-based Rogers Communications Inc., one of Canada’s leading cable 
      and telecommunications companies. From 2008 to 2011, she served as 
      senior vice president and CIO of Energy Future Holdings Corp. based in 
      Dallas and was CIO of Flowserve Corporation in Irving, Texas, from 2004 
      to 2008. From 1991 to 2004 she held a series of leadership positions at 
      General Electric including serving as CIO of GE Silicones.
    

      Jojo has received industry recognition on multiple occasions, earning 
      CIO 100 awards for transformation and innovation in three different 
      years and being named to the InformationWeek 500.
    

      She earned a master’s degree in Industrial Engineering & Management 
      Systems and a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Rensselaer 
      Polytechnic Institute.
    

      Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) is the nation’s leading competitive 
      energy provider, with 2014 revenues of approximately $27.4 billion. 
      Headquartered in Chicago, Exelon does business in 48 states, the

      competitive U.S. power generators, with more than 32,000 megawatts of 
      owned capacity comprising one of the nation’s cleanest and lowest-cost

      residential, public sector and business customers, including more than
