other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

Eve Hall: The African American Investment Fund in Milwaukee
Steven Rogers and Alterrell Mills
The case highlights the role of minority chambers of commerce and the background of Eve Hall, a well-regarded multi-sector leader asked to revive Wisconsin’s African-American chamber. This case study examines the lending options that a minority chamber of commerce considers when seeking to maximize value to its constituency. Students learn the challenges minority small business owners and entrepreneurs face, the role of non-financial institutions/community-based organizations in addressing those challenges, and the financial tools available to lenders and borrowers in this segment. Students learn how to analyze financing opportunities by assessing the value propositions of chambers of commerce, developing the risk-reward profile of each party involved, and deliberating as members of a board to reach a final lending decision.

Corey Thomas and the IPO
Steven Rogers and Derrick Collins
Corey Thomas, CEO of the company Rapid7, must decide if it is the right time to take the 15-year old startup public, as it stood poised to capitalize on what appears to be the next frontier for digital technology markets — cybersecurity.  In spite of positive industry trends, there are some nagging concerns that this might be a risky time in the public capital markets.  The company had just completed an acquisition and he had additional concerns that the public markets may not tolerate the inevitable early losses involved with the new acquisition.  Moreover, the company’s principal financiers are venture capital investors and an IPO or sale will represent an investment exit for them and their goal is return maximization.

Carmichael Roberts: To Create a Private Equity Firm?
Steven Rogers and Kenneth J. Cooper
Carmichael Roberts, a rare African-American venture capitalist, considered leaving his general partnership in a private equity firm near Boston and setting up his own in 2015. He weighed whether the timing was right, with the economy still not fully recovered from the Great Recession of 2007–2009. Where to base such a firm was another factor in his decision-making. A member of the board of the National Venture Capital Association, Roberts knew the industry was gravitating to the San Francisco Bay area, to invest in the social media and software startups centered there. His specialty and passion was bringing to market new products made from advanced materials that help people solve problems in their daily lives. That investment focus on manufacturing would go against the private equity trend, another factor he considered. But he knew few, if any, general partners at major private equity firms were focused singularly on the kinds of businesses in which he wanted to invest. Roberts also took into account the possible impact on his mutually respectful relations with his fellow partners. From a housing project in Brooklyn, New York, Roberts became a scientist who did advanced study at Duke and Harvard, capped off with an MBA from MIT. He had experience as a developer of technical products for Fortune 500 companies, an executive of cutting-edge startups, and a venture capitalist for eight years. This case study also reviews how private equity investment works, the private equity spectrum, the history of venture capital, stages of venture capital funds, and their locations.

Ebony Magazine
Steven Rogers and Derrick Jackson
For nearly 75 years, the Johnson Publishing Company has been the most successful African American magazine publisher. Its flagship Ebony magazine was an iconic coffee table fixture for decades in black households of all classes, making founder John H. Johnson the first African American to make the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans. But the privately-held company was now in the hands of his daughter and faced the bracing, debilitating winds besetting the entire magazine and newspaper industry. Linda Johnson Rice now had to decide what to do with the publications and brands of the company.
