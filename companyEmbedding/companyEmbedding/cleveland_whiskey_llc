Lix and Cleveland Whiskey use advanced technology to accelerate the maturation of whiskey, so that it will take weeks instead of years to produce their designer spirits.
Growth Challenge: By 2009, Lix had already spent considerable time and effort developing his concept in a makeshift basement lab. In order to attract serious investors, Lix needed to upgrade his test laboratory with state-of-the-art equipment that included temperature and pressure sensors, water filtration, plumbing, computerized control systems and other laboratory test equipment. It would take the right financing, space and expertise to make Cleveland Whiskey a reality.
How We Worked With Them: While searching for funding, Lix found the Cuyahoga County New Product Development Loan Fund, administered by MAGNET. From there it was a short step to renting lab and office space in The Incubator at MAGNET, which also gave him close proximity and easy access to MAGNET’s Product Design & Development (PDD) engineering team.
The PDD team helped Lix create detailed lab construction plans with 3D CAD software while supervising two Cleveland State University engineering interns as they installed the lab equipment. They also created the interface between the sensors that gather data in the stainless steel whiskey vats. The accompanying data analysis program has helped Lix and MAGNET overcome and regulate temperature and pressure issues in the tanks.
Outcome: The test lab has worked very well for Lix and Cleveland Whiskey as they look to patent their technology and assemble funding towards full commercial production. The company has already received funding from various foundations and funds in Cuyahoga County and their technology is already sharply reduced their whiskey’s time-to-market production compared to typical premium whiskey production.
Cleveland Whiskey hit store shelves in March of 2013.

Cleveland Whiskey Black Reserve Bourbon Review

March 21, 2013 





It’s new, it’s mysterious and it’s causing quite the ruckus in the whiskey community. Introducing the latest Ohio based Bourbon – Cleveland Whiskey’s Black Reserve Bourbon.
By definition this new spirit meets the technical standards to be called Bourbon but that’s about the only thing standard about their secret process. I’ve written earlier articles explaining the regulations and nuances of what differentiates bourbon from whiskey and throughout some of my reviews touched on some of the more interesting grains and their distilling process but the new Black Reserve Bourbon by Cleveland Whiskey is by far the most interesting process I have come across.
For starters, this whiskey isn’t being made on a country farm but produced in a start-up incubator run by MAGNET (Manufacturing and Advocacy Growth Network) near Cleveland State University by entrepreneur Tom Lix and his six-person team.
This small but mighty team is using a patent-pending process of “pressure aging” where a machine rapidly pushes alcohol (either their home made “white lightning” or sourced 6 month bourbon they purchase) in and out of used and charred barrel staves. This unique process aims to replicate the standard aging process that normally takes place when whiskey is placed in the cask but at an expeditious rate.
They claim that this secret process can “produce a bottle in under a week that can compare to a 10 or 12 year old version”. You can hear more about this process from Tom Lix himself in this video from Fox 8 News.
Parting Thoughts
I’m torn on what to say about the Black Reserve Bourbon by Cleveland Whiskey… I’m a huge advocate for craft distillers (especially those in Ohio), it’s reasonably priced ($35.00) and I applaud their use of a new process in order to push the industry for innovation but at the end of the day the focus should be on the taste and not the marketing. While I’m curious to see what the future holds for this upstart craft distiller this initial release didn’t live up to their claims of being comparable to a 10 or 12 year Bourbon already on the market.
I’m not saying don’t purchase a glass or a bottle. I’m suggesting going in with your expectations focused on purchasing it as a novelty whiskey or to support something locally made by a small group of enthusiasts.

Forbes – Cleveland Whiskey Ages Bourbon In One Week «  Cleveland Whiskey - Whiskey. Without Limits.™

















































Forbes – Cleveland Whiskey Ages Bourbon In One Week
May 29, 2013


Alex Knapp – Forbes Staff
The process of making bourbon whiskey hasn’t changed much in decades. A sour mash is fermented, then distilled into a clear spirit. After making the spirit, a distillery places it into charred, American oak barrels to age. Usually for several years, with premium bourbons often aging for nine years or more.

The New York Times – Making Whiskey at Whip Crack Speed
June 04, 2015


By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Everyone knows the secret to great whiskey is long, slow aging in oak barrels tucked away in cellars and warehouses for a decades-long nap.
Or is it?
Recently, some distillers have been taking shortcuts, using technology to mimic the effects of long aging — and prompting spirited debate over the merits of the resulting liquors.

Release Party – Bourbon finished in Maple Syrup barrel
November 19, 2016



 
On November 19th, we will be having a special limited release of a bourbon that has spent 7 months resting in barrel that was previously used to age maple syrup.
Cleveland Whiskey has been collaborating with Bissell Maple Farm in Jefferson, OH for a while now. We’ve been trading a few barrels back and forth so they can age their syrup in bourbon barrels, and in return we can age our bourbon in maple syrup barrels. A limited amount (less than 250 bottles) will be available to purchase out of the distillery that day as well.
As usual, we’ll come up with a creative cocktail featuring this limited product, and have samples available to taste.
Bissell Maple Farm will aslo be on site sampling out their delicious maple syrup aged in bourbon barrels. The syrup will be available for purchase as well.

RSVP on Facebook.

Hope to see everyone there.

You may have noticed that most of the new breed of distillers, like Tito Beveridge, of Tito’s Handmade Vodka, break in with vodka, which requires no aging, or begin with white whiskey, so-called white dog or clear whiskey, which can also go straight from still to bottle. It’s because the whiskey business imposes formidable barriers to entry.

Ready For Something Radically Different? «  Cleveland Whiskey - Whiskey. Without Limits.™
















































Ready For Something Radically Different?











For generations, oak has been used to age spirits simply because it has the right pore structure to hold liquid. It’s hard, if not impossible, to make a barrel out of black cherry, hickory, or honey locust that doesn’t leak like a sieve. And yet there are so many untapped flavor profiles that can come from these woods. Our technology captures those flavors, letting creativity and innovation shine.











Bourbon Whiskey Finished with
Black Cherry Wood

Rich texture and well rounded. Light flavor from the cherry wood with a slightly tart, slightly sweet spice note.
94 PROOF












Bourbon Whiskey Finished with
Apple Wood

Light and airy body. A tender sweetness with notes of baking spice backstopped by an almost tart finish.
90 PROOF












Bourbon Whiskey Finished with
Hickory Wood

The hickory wood imparts noticeable, but not overbearing smoky undertones. Toffee, spice, and vanilla round out the palate.
94 PROOF












Bourbon Whiskey Finished with
Sugar Maple Wood

Rich and robust color. Medium to full bodied mouth feel. Subtle sweet maple, vanilla and caramel undertones.
92 PROOF












Bourbon Whiskey Finished with
Honey Locust Wood

Unique, silky mouth feel. The honey locust wood imparts a very light, almost floral taste profile. Soft and Elegant.

Release Party – Bourbon finished in Maple Syrup barrel
November 19, 2016



 
On November 19th, we will be having a special limited release of a bourbon that has spent 7 months resting in barrel that was previously used to age maple syrup.
Cleveland Whiskey has been collaborating with Bissell Maple Farm in Jefferson, OH for a while now. We’ve been trading a few barrels back and forth so they can age their syrup in bourbon barrels, and in return we can age our bourbon in maple syrup barrels. A limited amount (less than 250 bottles) will be available to purchase out of the distillery that day as well.
As usual, we’ll come up with a creative cocktail featuring this limited product, and have samples available to taste.
Bissell Maple Farm will aslo be on site sampling out their delicious maple syrup aged in bourbon barrels. The syrup will be available for purchase as well.

RSVP on Facebook.

Hope to see everyone there.
