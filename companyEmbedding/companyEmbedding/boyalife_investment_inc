CESCA ANNOUNCES $15 MILLION STRATEGIC INVESTMENT FROM BOYALIFE GROUP发布者：admin  发布时间：2016/2/4 18:00:41  点击：677Funds to be used to repay current senior secured convertible debentures and provide additional working capital to fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives 
RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif., February 2, 2016-- Cesca Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: KOOL), an autologous cell-based regenerative medicine company, today announced that affiliates of Boyalife Group have agreed to invest $15.0 million in the Company (the “Boyalife Financing”), enabling the Company to repay currently outstanding senior secured convertible debentures and retire associated Series B Warrants. The investments will also provide additional working capital to fund the Company’s ongoing operations and strategic initiatives.  
Boyalife Group was founded in July 2009 and supported by several major grants from the Ministry of Science & Technology in China. Through a strong industrial-research alliance among top research institutes, Boyalife Group has grown into a substantial company with more than 36 subsidiaries.Boyalife Group focuses on various aspects of stem cell technology and regenerative medicine, genetic diagnostics, precision medicine, cloning technologies, innovative drug discoveries and disease mechanistic studies.
Under the terms of the agreement the Company will issue $2.5 million of Common Stock (the “Stock Purchase”) at $0.17 per share (the “Stock Price”), which represents the 20 day simple moving average of the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market as of February 2, 2016, senior secured three-year debentures (convertible into Common Stock at the Stock Price), with a principal face amount of up to $12.5 million that accrues interest at 22% per year (the “Boyalife Debentures”), and five-year warrants to purchase additional shares of Common Stock equal to 80% of the shares sold to Boyalife Group (assuming full conversion of the Boyalife Debentures), exercisable in cash only at $0.40 per share (the “Boyalife Warrants”).  
In addition, the Company has also reached an agreement with its senior secured note holder regarding the repayment of currently outstanding debentures and the surrender and termination of its remaining Series B Warrants.
The Nasdaq Stock Market rules would normally require stockholder approval prior to closing the Boyalife Financing; however, the Company requested and has received a financial viability exception to the stockholder approval requirement pursuant to Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 5635(f).The financial viability exception allows an issuer to issue securities upon prior written application to Nasdaq when the delay in securing stockholder approval of such issuance would seriously jeopardize the financial viability of the company. On February 2, 2016, Nasdaq granted the financial viability exception, provided that the Company complies with the conditions of the exception provided in Rule 5635(f). 
“I am very pleased that we have been able to attract a strategic investor of the caliber of Boyalife,” said Robin Stracey, Chief Executive Officer of Cesca. “Boyalife has been a customer of ours for several years and has very complementary long term interests in advancing the safe and effective practice of regenerative medicine. We look forward to working with them, not only in advancing our existing pipeline of promising clinical protocols, but also expanding our portfolio and enhancing our international footprint.”
Dr. Xiaochun Xu, Chairman and CEO of Boyalife Group commented, “This investment lays the foundation for what we see as a strong and continuingstrategic alliance between our two companies. Beyond Cesca’s existing pipeline of autologous cell-based therapies, this partnership has the potential to enable access to a much broader scope of clinical applications as well as accelerate penetration of the 1.3 billion person market in China.”

Boyalife Announces Recent Changes to Management and the Board of 
      Directors of Cesca Therapeutics by Majority Shareholder Vote






November 04, 2016 12:17 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WUXI, China--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Boyalife Investment Inc. and Boyalife (Hong Kong) Limited (collectively, 
      “Boyalife”), as the majority shareholders of Cesca Therapeutics Inc. 
      (NASDAQ: KOOL) (the “Company), an autologous cell-based regenerative 
      medicine company, provided the Company with written notice removing Mr. 
      Craig W. Moore, Mr. Mark Bagnall and Mr. Robin Stracey from the board of 
      directors of the Company, effective November 3, 2016.
    


      Prior to the removal of Mr. Moore, Mr. Bagnall and Mr. Stracey, the 
      board of directors of the Company unanimously nominated and appointed 
      Jim Xu to the board of directors of the Company. After the removal of 
      the three directors, and in accordance with a voting agreement between 
      the Company and Boyalife, Boyalife took further action to appoint Vivian 
      Liu as an independent director to the board of directors of the Company, 
      effective immediately on November 3, 2016. The board of directors then 
      nominated and unanimously appointed Dr. Xiaochun (Chris) Xu as the new 
      Chairman of the board of directors of the Company.
    

      In addition, the board of directors of the Company removed Mr. Robin 
      Stracey as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and appointed Dr. 
      Xu as the interim Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately on 
      November 3, 2016. The Company is commencing a search for a permanent 
      Chief Executive Officer and for two additional independent directors, 
      which it is seeking to appoint as promptly as practicable.
    

      Dr. Xiaochun (Chris) Xu, the newly appointed Chairman of Board and 
      Interim CEO states, "Cesca needs to position itself to be a leader in 
      the fast growing regenerative medicine field. In order to do so, a 
      company has to have global vision and a sharp sense of the market 
      trends. We are looking forward to moving more aggressively into the 
      global market to grow the Company into a global player.”
    

      Cesca Therapeutics previously converted a senior secured three year

      interest into 6,102,941 shares of its common stock, in accordance with 
      the previously announced purchase agreement entered into between Cesca

      Boyalife believes that the newly appointed directors provide the Company 
      with the expertise it requires in order to achieve its growth and 
      development plans, as well as puts the Company in a better position for 
      future investments. In addition, Boyalife agrees with the board of 
      directors’ decision to remove Robin Stracey as CEO and appoint Dr. Xu as 
      interim CEO until the process to identify a permanent CEO replacement

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
