Patience






We believe in order to be successful over the long-term, investors need a "counter-intuitive" mindset.  Following the crowd will eventually lead to poor investment results.  Two of the best teachers of this philosophy are quoted below..."In the stock market, the only way to get a bargain is to buy what most investors are selling."Sir John Templeton"Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy."Warren BuffettSuccessful, long-term investing is not an easy process.  One need look no further than the recent financial crisis of 2008-09 to prove this point.  The swings between greed and fear can drive investors to abandon their discipline at the worst possible moment.Greatmark seeks to buy good companies when they are temporarily out of favor and when their stock prices are depressed.  As a result of buying companies "on sale" and out of favor, it rarely coincides with immediate gratification. Because we are focused on the long-term when we make the purchase, we don't feel the need to obsess over what happens in the next 3-5 weeks or 3-5 months.  Partnering with a great business as an owner (rather than a trader) enables us to not be swayed in our conviction due to short-term market fluctuations.

Portfolio Activity






Greatmark Investment Partners serves a vital role in helping clients manage the emotions of investing.  Markets are, in large part, driven in the short-term by the emotions of greed and fear.  One week an investor will feel like "getting out while I still can" and the very next week, he will want both feet planted on the accelerator trying to "make as much as we can".  This swing in emotions will lead to over-trading a portfolio attempting to capture short-term market moves.  We believe trigger happy investors are much more prone to shoot themselves in the foot rather than being able to accurately time the emotional whims of an entire stock market.Consider that in a 10-year period from 1985-1995, the average stock mutual fund posted an average annual return of 12.3% yet the average investor in those mutual funds only realized returns of 6.3%.  Investors captured about half the actual return the funds produced due to the client's tendency to trade in/out of the funds at the worst possible time as they chased performance or gave into fear.Investor's desire to "grab the gains while we can and avoid all the big declines" leads to market timing and ultimately, poor investing results.  Most end up buying near the top and selling out near the bottom.  It also tends to lead to over-diversification.  The average mutual fund has an 86% annual turnover (meaning, the average length of ownership for each stock is a little more than a year and 86% of the portfolio is bought/sold in one year) and holds 132 stocks with no stock making up more than 5% of the portfolio.  Nearly 100% turnover doesn't indicate to us a patient, long-term approach and it perhaps explains why so many actively managed funds have such a hard time beating the market - their clients are pouring money in near the top and yanking money out near the bottom.  The portfolio manager of the funds over-diversifies to try and mitigate these risks and, in turn, neutralizes the portfolio's ability to beat the market.Greatmark's turnover averages less than 15% a year implying an average holding period for our stocks of 5-7 years.

Assessment -  If you so desire, we will sit down with you and do a comprehensive financial review.  We will review all of your financial assets - your real estate, brokerage accounts, retirement plan assets and other assets.  Then we will review your debt - mortgages, car loans, business loans, etc. and we'll review your educational funding for children/grandchildren.  Lastly, we'll discuss your planning needs - retirement planning, long-term health, college funding, plans to care for your parents/in-laws, etc.Debt - one of the major issues facing Americans today is debt.  We have helped a number of clients restructure their balance sheet to payoff debt as the first step in a new long-term financial plan.  In some cases, this means taking money away from portfolios we might end up managing to retire debt.  We want to give you the best advice we can to help you achieve your goals, even if it means we lose business.  Taking a long-term view helps a great deal.  Paying off a house or fully funding college needs provides great peace of mind and frees up cash flow for the next step of the financial plan.Portfolio review - after the initial assessment and review of assets/debt, we will review all of your investment portfolios.  This usually winds up in a consolidation of your investments into one location because most clients tend to have assets spread out all over the place - from stock certificates in your safe deposit box to old retirement plan accounts to a mutual fund held at the fund company to a brokerage account that formerly was managed and is now dormant - we will help you consolidate all these assets and eliminate a number of accounts.  This helps at tax time by eliminating some of the 1099's you must keep track of and it gives you a fresh start.  Oftentimes in this process, we will find a number of small positions we can eliminate - shares that came to you via mergers or spin-offs or some "hot" stock bought a few years ago that didn't pan out.  We'll clean up the portfolios and help get your investments focused into our agreed upon strategy going forward.Tax sensitivity - we will be careful to manage the tax implications of major changes we make to your portfolios as we take over active management.  We'll want to run ideas by your CPA and will work with them to make sure we are all on same page.Cash management - we will help you manage your cash either coming into your portfolio on a monthly basis during the accumulation phase of life - or - by paying out monthly income to you as you move into retirement.  We coordinate your required minimum distributions from your IRAs and we can withhold taxes and deposit the distributions via Automated Funds Transfer directly to your checking account.  Many people keep too much money sitting dormant in the bank.  We'll help you construct a strategy to get this money working for you while maintaining flexibility to meet your needs.On-going monitoring - We'll keep track of your plan and monitor your progress and the cash coming/going from your accounts to make sure the plan is staying on track.  Life happens and things change.  The plan is not a one-time document but rather it is adjusted over time to meet your changing circumstances.  We want to be your financial partner and we welcome your dialogue about your needs and changing circumstances.  Our management fee is comprehensive and covers all our planning work.  We don't charge you for our meetings or our time invested.
