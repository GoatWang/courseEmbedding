Sandra Van Trease Dances for a Cause



Sandra Van Trease, BJC group president and interim president for BJC Medical Group, put her weeks of dance training to the test on Saturday, Jan. 28, when she competed in Dancing with the St. Louis Stars. The competition benefits Independence Center, an organization serving the mentally ill in St. Louis. 


Each year, corporate and community leaders are paired with a professional dance instructor to choreograph a dance routine. The night of the competition, each couple danced before an audience and a panel of judges. See Van Trease's performance here.
Van Trease began attending lessons in November with professional dance partner David Scherer, a winner of national and local dance competitions. 
Money is raised through votes on the Dancing with the St. Louis Stars website, where each vote is $10, through corporate sponsorships and through table sales for the event. The teams collectively raise more than $836,000! 
Independence Center provides programs and services that help adults in the St. Louis metropolitan area with serious and persistent mental illnesses to live and work in the community.
Located on Forest Park Avenue near the Washington University Medical Center complex, Independence Center serves about 1,500 individuals each year through programs for education, employment, wellness, housing and work readiness. Psychiatric services and community support are provided in collaboration with Washington University School of Medicine and BJC HealthCare.
Why I’m dancing
I know there are a number of worthy causes to support and here’s why I believe in this one: 
The members of Independence Center I spoke with recently told me Independence Center isn’t just part of their community, it is a community. It eliminates members’ isolation, develops self-esteem in a safe environment, helps develop skills and finds them transitional jobs with supportive employers. They are provided with daily meals, access to showers and laundry services, and can even receive help finding clean and safe housing. In fact, Independence Center provides a lifelong support system because once you’re a member, you’re a member for life. 
Best of all, it works. It works for families with nowhere to turn to help a loved one, and it works for those suffering in isolation. 
I hope you will join me as I support this cause with heart and “sole!”
— Sandra Van Trease


Lipstein danced to St. Louis stardom in 2013









BJC president and CEO Steve Lipstein and his dance partner cut loose to the high-energy hit “Footloose” at Dancing with the St. Louis Stars on Jan. 26, 2013 — and took home top honors for both performance and fund raising to benefit Independence Center, raising more than $32,000 through online voting and donations.
“The most important part of the competition was raising awareness and money to support the outstanding work done by Independence Center,” Lipstein said. “The hardest part was learning not to count my steps out loud.”
