They talk through how and when John began working in the business, what he learned and gained from both his early experience as well as working with multiple siblings, and an father who decided to "un-retire".  His thinking and ideas on how he will apply the wisdom he gained when the next generation of Kane children expresses an interest in working in the country's most successful commercial moving company is also made clear in the interview.  This interview is a window into the experience and success of a leader who started working with a father in childhood, the father-son working dynamic, the challenges and solutions of multiple siblings in a family business, the importance of keeping the right culture in the company, and some of the avenues to a successful succession plan.

Background:
John Kane was born in 1961 in Washington, D.C. and until the age of 10, was raised in New Carrollton, Maryland.  During his formative years he was raised in Chevy Chase and Silver Spring.  He is one of nine siblings all of whom, but one, still reside in Maryland.  John has 51 first cousins.  Family Christmas parties usually mean 150 relatives wearing name badges.
In 1972 at the age of 12, John Kane began his career in the transportation industry by washing trucks for his father. He worked his way steadily through the organization, and in 1998, after seven years as president of the family business, John purchased the former E. I. Kane, Inc., and further energized the transformed Kane Company with his broad passion for success.
During the last several years the company has created 500 jobs and expanded into three additional states in the Mid-Atlantic area.  
Under John's leadership, the company has received many awards in the industry, particularly in the field of safety.  In 2004 and 2007, Office Movers, Inc. received the Maryland Motor Truck Association Chairman's Safety Award.  Throughout the company's years, numerous awards have been received for safe driving and employee safety.  The Kane Company was named by the Washington Business Journal in 2007, "Best Places to Work."  In 2007, Baltimore Business Journal voted Office Movers, Inc., as "Top Employer," and "Top Private Company."  Core Net Global honored Office Movers, Inc. with the "2008 Service Provider Leadership" award.  In 2007, the Greater Washington Commercial Association of Realtors recognized Office Movers, Inc. as "Best in the Industry Movers."  For over 15 years, Office Movers, Inc. has been recognized by the Washington Business Journal as the largest moving company in the Mid-Atlantic area.
Today, the Kane Company expresses its commitment to total customer satisfaction through four subsidiaries- Office Movers, Inc., Office Installers, Inc., Office Archives, LLC, and Kane 3PL, LLC, a third-party logistics provider. Kane, a serial entrepreneur, started a new company, Office Shredding, LLC, in December 2007, and recently started eCyclers, LLC, in September 2008.  The Company has over 1,350 associates.
John's introduction to management commenced upon his graduation from Mount Saint Mary's University in Emmitsburg, Maryland, when he became a service representative for Office Movers, Inc. in Landover, Maryland.  Over the course of 10 years, he was promoted from Branch Manager to Executive Vice President and became President of the E. I. Kane Company in 1992.
Besides his degree from Mount Saint Mary's University, he has continued to pursue educational opportunities through the Wharton School of Business' Senior Management Program.  In addition, he has tirelessly devoted his energy to the success of the transportation industry and he is an advocate for transportation safety, infrastructure development and balanced growth.  He has held positions as Vice President for the American Trucking Association, President and Chairman of the Washington, DC Area Trucking Association, Chairman of the Maryland Motor Truck Association, and Chairman of the Greater Washington Area Board of Trade's Transportation and Environment Committee.  John is currently the Chairman of the Greater Washington Board of Trade.
Recognizing the importance of community, John serves or has served on the Boards of the Stone Ridge School, Imagination Stage, Goodwill of Maryland, Washington, D.C. Area Food Bank, UMMC Shock Trauma in Baltimore, Junior Achievement, Maryland Chamber of Commerce, and Mount Saint Mary's University.  Mount Saint Mary's recognized him as Alumnus of the Year.  He and his wife, Mary, received the 2007 President's Medal for outstanding service and loyalty to the State of Maryland.  John was named in 2007 as one of "Washingtonians Power 150."  He was also voted as one of the 150 powerful people in Washington, DC by the Washingtonian Magazine.
John Kane has been active in politics for many years and completed a four year term as Chairman of the Maryland State Republican Party.
Recognized for contributions to business, politics and the community, John and his wife, Mary, were voted as one of Maryland's most influential couples.
John and Mary have three children, Jack, Grace, and Elizabeth and reside in Potomac, Maryland.

Biography
I am an Associate Professor of Surgery and Chief of the Melanoma/Sarcoma service at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI). My interest in melanoma, sarcoma, and regional therapies dates back to the beginning of my practice in the year 2000. I am the main sarcoma surgeon at RPCI and treat soft tissue sarcomas at all anatomic locations; extremity, truncal, intra-abdominal/retroperitoneal, head and neck, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). I am a member of major sarcoma groups including the NCCN Sarcoma Panel, the Connective Tissue Oncology Society, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Sarcoma Committee. I have been the lead investigator for several sarcoma trials at RPCI, have authored multiple papers on the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas, and have been an invited speaker on this topic at national meetings. I oversee our weekly sarcoma/soft tissue tumor multidisciplinary conference where all new sarcoma and rare soft tissue tumor cases are discussed in order to develop the optimal treatment plan.
I also treat unusual benign and locally aggressive soft tissue tumors. These include desmoid/aggressive fibromatosis, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), neurogenic tumors such as neurofibroma and schwannoma, large and atypical intramuscular lipomatous tumors, solitary fibrous tumor, ganglioneuroma, and adrenal myelolipoma. As noted above, our weekly multidisciplinary conference allows for a thorough discussion of the patients with these various tumors. In some cases, surgery may not even be necessary.
I have a significant clinical interest in melanoma and other aggressive cutaneous malignancies such as Merkel cell carcinoma. Our Institution has been offering sentinel lymph node biopsy since 1996 and I have personally performed over 450. For patients with nodal metastatic disease, I frequently perform axillary dissections (very different from what is done for breast cancer), superficial and deep groin dissections, and even less common lymphadenectomies in the epitrochlear and popliteal basins. I have advanced the regional therapies program at RPCI for patients with isolated extremity disease (in transit melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and some sarcomas) that is no longer amenable to simple surgical excision. Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) or isolated limb infusion (ILI) can still be potentially curative in these situations. Roswell Park Cancer Institute is one of only two institutions in New York State that performs these isolated regional therapies.
As another type of isolated regional therapy, I developed the cytoreduction/hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) program at RPCI in 2002. I routinely perform cytoreductive surgery/HIPEC for appendiceal neoplasms, colorectal cancer, mesothelioma, and other peritoneal surface malignancies. In addition to patients with these diseases in WNY, I have provided this treatment option for the province of Ontario.
Aside from my clinical responsibilities, I serve as the Surgical Oncology Fellowship Program Director and on the Executive Council of the Society of Surgical Oncology. I am a fellow of the American College of Surgeons and a member of multiple surgical and oncologic societies, including the Society of Surgical Oncology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the Association for Academic Surgeons. I have served as the past president for both the WNY Chapter of the American College of Surgeons and the Buffalo Surgical Society. I was also previously the WNY State Chair for the ACS Commission on Cancer.

These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
