The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Wright, Christopher W carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Wright, Christopher W currently holds license 16851, 144481 (Plumber), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Wright, Christopher W



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Wright, Christopher W



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Wright, Christopher W



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).
