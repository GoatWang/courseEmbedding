Sarasin & Partners











Sarasin & Partnersâ Institutional Conference 
Tuesday 3rd November 2015
What lies beyond?
The changing power behind investment markets
Our panel of expert speakers will explore some of the underappreciated factors which may define future investment returns such as major geopolitical imbalances, societal changes including inequality and migration, policy risks and environmental concerns, not least climate change and the shifting energy mix.
Sessions will be interactive, which plenty of time to share your thoughts and concerns as you shape your investment strategy for the future. We have arguably reached an inflection point leaving the liquidity-driven markets behind us, as we enter a new era no longer fuelled by central bank intervention and ultra-low interest rates. The factors which shape future returns will certainly be different.
