What is a Joint Venture?




Joint ventures can provide opportunities for growth for small businesses.


By Armand Aponte

Savvy business owners looking to expand their revenue channels will 
keep a watchful eye for opportunities leading to growth, profitability, 
and additional market share. Amongst the various growth strategies 
available, some business owners may want to consider a joint venture. 
Although joint ventures are often associated with large companies or 
international deals, if used under the right circumstances they can be 
effective for small business owners as well.
Key Elements of a Joint Venture
A
 joint venture is created when two or more established businesses agree 
to pool their resources and respective talents to achieve a particular 
goal. Typically, joint ventures are formed for a limited period of time 
in order to accomplish a specific business goal. You create a joint 
venture by entering into a contract with another business or party; 
there is no formal state or federal filing required. Under a joint 
venture arrangement, each party contributes cash, property, assets, or 
other resources to the business venture and then the parties agree on 
how profits, losses, management, and control of the venture will be 
divided. Although a joint venture shares many of the same 
characteristics as a partnership, the key difference is that a joint 
venture is based on a single business transaction for a limited time 
period whereas a partnership usually involves a long-term, ongoing 
business relationship.
There are two ways to set up a joint 
venture. One option is for two businesses to agree to join forces and 
cooperate with each other in a limited and specific way. For example, 
one business might want to sell its product through another company’s 
distribution network. The two companies would enter into a contract 
setting out the terms and conditions of how this would work. 
Alternatively, two businesses might decide to set up a separate and 
independent business to handle the joint venture work or project. For 
example, two business owners might decide to form a corporation, limited
 liability company, or partnership to produce and sell a new product 
through their joint arrangement. However you decide to set up your joint
 venture, you will need a clear legal agreement setting out how the 
joint venture will work.
Benefits & Risks of a Joint Venture
Businesses
 often decide to enter into a joint venture because they believe that 
combining resources with another business will lead to better growth and
 profitability than either business could achieve operating on its own. 
Some of the benefits that businesses can provide to each other in a 
joint venture arrangement include:

access to new markets and distribution channels
added specialized expertise and resources, including research and development, and
additional financing and purchasing power.

By
 taking advantage of another business’s strength in an area where your 
business is weak and offering a complementary benefit to the other 
business, a joint venture arrangement can be beneficial to both 
businesses. For example, if you have a product you want to sell but no 
sales force or presence in that market, you could establish a joint 
venture with a business that has an existing distribution channel or 
sales force capable of reaching customers for your product. Through the 
joint venture arrangement, you immediately gain access to customers and 
expand your market presence without having to hire a sales force, take 
on debt, seek outside investors, or otherwise commit your own resources.
 In turn, having a new product to market to an existing customer base is
 a complementary benefit that you provide to the other company.
Joint
 ventures are also useful where there are licenses and regulatory 
requirements to do business, a standard hurdle for companies trying to 
access foreign markets. A joint venture allows the business trying to 
access a regulated market to leverage another business’s established 
presence without having to go through the licensing and regulatory 
paperwork that would otherwise be required, a potentially enormous 
benefit to the party trying to gain access to that market.
As good
 as this may sound, even under ideal circumstances, there are risks with
 starting a joint venture. Business partnerships are complicated; be 
realistic about your expectations and think about whether this type of 
arrangement is the best option for you. You will want to make sure that 
your joint venture partner complements your own business' strengths and 
weaknesses and that you offer something to the other business as well. 
Performing a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) 
analysis can help identify potential areas where you might want to align
 your resources with another firm. You can also look at what other 
similar businesses have done and try to identify what they did to 
partner successfully. Finding the right fit takes time and effort but is
 a crucial step in the process. While something may look good on paper, 
don’t underestimate the importance of a good working relationship to the
 ultimate success of your venture.
Tips for Success
Success
 in a joint venture depends on thorough research and an analysis of the 
joint venture’s aims and objectives and the parties involved in the 
transaction. Ultimately, the joint venture must be beneficial for both 
parties to succeed. Here are some tips for success:

ensure the goals and expectations of the venture are clear and agreed to by all parties
balance levels of expertise and investment contributed by the different parties
identify and integrate cultures and management styles of the partnering firms
provide sufficient leadership and support, particularly in the early stages, and
make sure the staff and everyone involved understands the purpose of the joint venture.

Joint Venture Agreement
Like
 any business transaction, the terms and conditions of your joint 
venture should be clearly laid out in a written agreement. Key 
provisions in a joint venture agreement should include:

the business objectives of the joint venture
the
 structure of the joint venture (whether it will be a separately formed 
enterprise or operated through the existing businesses)
each party’s contributions to the venture, including cash, property, or asset contributions
management and control of the joint venture
how profits, losses, and liabilities will be shared
the role of employees in the joint venture
how intellectual property created by the joint venture will be treated
dispute mechanism between the parties
its duration or procedures to terminate the joint venture, and
a confidentiality clause to protect any commercial secrets.

A
 formal contract is necessary for all parties’ protection and to make 
sure everyone understands the terms and conditions of the venture.

976 F.Supp. 124 (1997)


Larry FORBES, d/b/a Surgical Specialist
v.
JOINT MEDICAL PRODUCTS CORP. and Johnson and Johnson Professional, Inc.


United States District Court, D. Connecticut.
July 24, 1997.








Attorney(s) appearing for the Case
Richard Jacobs, Jacobs, Jacobs & Shannon, New Haven, CT, Andrew Kasmen, Mitchell Kramer, M. Kramer & Associates, Jenkintown, PA, for Plaintiff.
Gary MacMillan, Scott Lucas, MacMillan & Lucas, Stamford, CT, for Defendants.





RULING ON DEFENDANTS' PARTIAL MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
NEVAS, District Judge.
The plaintiff, Larry Forbes ("Forbes"), brings this suit against the defendants, Joint Medical Products Corporation ("JMPC") and Johnson and Johnson Professional, Inc. ("J & J"), for violation of the Connecticut Franchise Act, Conn. Gen.Stat. §§ 42-133e-h (Count One), breach of contract (Count Two), breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Counts Three and Four), interference with prospective economic advantage (Count Five), and tortious interference with contractual relations (Counts Six and Seven).
Now pending before the court is the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on  Counts One and Three. For the reasons stated below, this motion [doc. # 21] is GRANTED. Forbes is directed to file an amended complaint within thirty (30) days of this ruling, which shall include only Counts Two, Four, Five, Six and Seven.
STANDARD
A motion for summary judgment may not be granted unless the court determines that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P.; Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The substantive law governing the case identifies those facts that are material on a motion for summary judgment. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510. A court must grant summary judgment "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact ...." Rule 56(c); see Miner v. Glens Falls, 999 F.2d 655, 661 (2d Cir.1993) (citation omitted). A dispute regarding a material fact is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Aldrich v. Randolph Cent. Sch. Dist., 963 F.2d 520, 523 (2d Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 965, 113 S.Ct. 440, 121 L.Ed.2d 359 (1992). The burden of showing that no genuine dispute about an issue of material fact exists rests on the party seeking summary judgment. See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1608, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970).
After discovery, if the party against whom summary judgment is sought "has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of [its] case with respect to which [it] has the burden of proof," then summary judgment is appropriate. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552-53, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). In assessing the record to determine whether a genuine dispute as to a material fact exists, the court is required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. at 2513-14. Thus, "[o]nly when reasonable minds could not differ as to the import of the evidence is summary judgment proper." Bryant v. Maffucci, 923 F.2d 979, 982 (2d Cir.) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 849, 112 S.Ct. 152, 116 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991).
FACTS
Forbes was, at all times during his relationship with JMPC, an individual resident of Texas, doing business as "Surgical Specialist," with his principal place of business in Houston, Texas. (See Defs.' Stat. Mat. Facts About Which There is no Genuine Issue [hereinafter "Defs.' Stat."] ¶ 1.) Until JMPC merged with J & J in 1995, it was a Delaware corporation, authorized to do business in Connecticut, with its principal place of business in Stamford, Connecticut. (See id. ¶ 2.)
Prior to its merger with J & J, JMPC sold human joint replacement devices to hospitals and surgeons. (See Aff. C. Anthony Whittingham [hereinafter "Whittingham Aff."] ¶ 5.) Its principal product was a total-hip prothesis, for use in partial or total hip joint replacement surgery. (Id.) JMPC marketed its products through a network of independent distributors who were assigned a territory and compensated on a commission basis. (See id. ¶ 6.) These distributors did not purchase JMPC products for resale. (See id. ¶ 7.) Rather, they maintained an inventory of JMPC products on a consignment basis. (Id.) When a distributor sold a product, JMPC would bill the customer based on paperwork submitted by the distributor and then pay the distributor a commission. (Id.)
In November 1987, Forbes began selling JMPC's prosthetic hip and knee implants to hospitals and surgeons for use in knee and hip replacement surgery. (See Aff. Larry D. Forbes [hereinafter "Forbes Aff."] ¶ 2.) These products were particularly well-suited for "revision surgery," in which the product is used to replace a previously inserted implant that has worn out over time. (Id.) JMPC initially assigned Forbes to the San Antonio, Texas area, but by 1995, his territory included southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana. (See Whittingham Aff. ¶ 8.) Every year, Forbes received new quotas for his  territory and signed a new distributor agreement. (See id. ¶ 9.)
According to the 1995 agreement, which Forbes signed on February 9, 1995, JMPC had the right to terminate its relationship with Forbes at any time. It stated:
The Distributor Agreement is for an indefinite term, is at the will of each of the parties to it, and JMPC has the right to recall all consigned inventory and terminate the Distributor Agreement at any time.
(First Am. Compl. Ex. 1, at 1.) The agreement further provided that, if JMPC merged with another company, it would allow distributors in good standing to continue selling under the current agreement for a specified number of months, depending on how long the distributor had been employed by JMPC. (See id. at 47.) The agreement specified that any disputes arising under it would be governed by the law of the State of Connecticut. (See id. at 1 (stating that "by entering into the Distributor Agreement the [d]istributor stipulates to jurisdiction of the courts in the State of Connecticut over any dispute between JMPC and the [d]istributor.").)
On April 26, 1995, JMPC notified Forbes that it had agreed to merge with J & J and that, "unless notified otherwise, ... all ... present agreements will remain in effect." (First Am. Compl. Ex. B.) Then, by letter dated July 28, 1995, JMPC terminated Forbes's distributor agreement and offered him an additional six months to continue selling its products (i.e. until January 26, 1996). (See id. Ex. C.) On September 18, 1995, Forbes commenced this law suit.
DISCUSSION
In Count One, Forbes alleges that JMPC terminated his alleged franchise agreement without good cause, in violation of Conn. Gen.Stat. § 42-133e. (See First Am. Compl. Count One.) In Count Three, he alleges that this termination of the agreement breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
The defendants claim that summary judgment should enter as to Counts One and Three because, while Connecticut law governs this dispute, the Connecticut Franchise Act ("the Act") is not applicable to individuals such as Forbes who do not maintain a place of business in Connecticut. The court agrees.
The Act prohibits franchisors from, inter alia, canceling or failing to renew a franchise agreement without good cause. See Conn. Gen.Stat. § 42-133f(a). However, the Act only applies to a franchise agreement, "the performance of which contemplates or requires the franchisee to establish or maintain a place of business in this state." Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. § 42-133h (West 1992).
Forbes argues that the provision in the Distributor Agreement which states that Connecticut law shall apply to any disputes arising from the agreement affords him the protections of the Act. He claims that the parties included a clause stating that Connecticut law applied to potential future disputes because they specifically contemplated that the Act would apply to their franchise agreement. However, without deciding whether Forbes was actually a "franchisee" as defined by the Act, a fair reading of both the Act itself and the case law interpreting it lead the court to conclude that only franchisees who have established or maintained a place of business in Connecticut are covered by the Act.
Forbes did not maintain a place of business in Connecticut. Under the parties' agreement, JMPC assigned him a territory in Texas. Thus, the performance of his agreement with JMPC did not "contemplate[] or require[] the franchisee to establish or maintain a place of business in [Connecticut]." Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. § 42-133h (West 1992). The provision of the agreement which states that Connecticut law applies to future disputes merely governs which state's laws applies to such disputes, not whether the jurisdictional prerequisites of a specific statute have been satisfied. A plain reading of the Act reveals that it does not protect Forbes because his agreement with JMPC did not contemplate or require that he maintain a business in Connecticut.
Furthermore, "it is doubtful that the Connecticut franchise law applies extraterritorially." H.J., Inc. v. ITT Corp., 867 F.2d 1531,  1546 (8th Cir.1989) (citing Carlos v. Philips Bus. Sys., Inc., 556 F.Supp. 769, 777 (E.D.N.Y.1983) (holding the Act does not have extraterritorial effect)). The court can find no authority supporting the proposition that the Act was intended to protect franchisees outside of Connecticut. Id. Rather, the Act only applies to Connecticut franchisees who present evidence that they contemplated establishing or maintaining a place of business in Connecticut. See Auto Parks, Inc. v. Stanley Works, Civ. A. No. 89-0183, 1990 WL 107587, at *7 (E.D.Pa. July 27, 1990). Without such evidence, the Act is inapplicable. Id. Here, the evidence shows, and the parties do not dispute, that Forbes maintained his business and conducted his marketing activity in Texas. Cf. Chem-Tek, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., 816 F.Supp. 123 (D.Conn.1993) (holding that the Act was applicable to an alleged franchisee who maintained its place of business in Connecticut, regardless of where the franchisee focussed its marketing activity). Thus, Forbes is not covered by the Act, and summary judgment must enter as to Count One.
As to Count Three, Forbes argues that "[b]ecause a franchise relationship existed between Forbes and JMPC, JMPC's termination of Forbes in violation of the Franchise Act was also a violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing." (Pl.'s Opp. Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. at 23.) He claims that the provisions in the distributor agreement which state that the agreement is terminable, at the will of the parties, or if JMPC merges with another company, do not trump the provisions of the Act which state that a franchise agreement may not be terminated without good cause. (See id. at 24.) However, because the court has held that Forbes is not protected by the provisions of the Act, this count must also fail. In addition, there is nothing in the record to contradict the specific provisions of the distributor agreement which allow JMPC to terminate Forbes if it merges with another company. Accordingly, summary judgment must also enter as to Count Three.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [doc. # 21] is GRANTED. Forbes is directed to file an amended complaint within thirty (30) days of this ruling which shall include only Counts Two, Four, Five, Six and Seven.

Bridge & Highway
A World Class Partner in Bridge Expansion Control Systems
Reliable, Sustainable, Innovative Product Solutions for the Construction Industry.
Watson Bowman Acme Corp. has been at the industry forefront of design and manufacture of expansion joints for the bridge construction industry. From its modest beginnings in the 1950's, designing small movement pavement seals for concrete highway applications, to producing today's state of the art large movement seismically designed modular expansion joint devices on the world's largest segmental concrete structures, Watson Bowman Acme has provided technical support and product solutions for the most complex and challenging applications.
 
Expansion joints operate in unique environments and are a critical link to the sustainability of a bridge structure. The effects of failing expansion joints or improper system selection will severely weaken the structural integrity of a bridge. Watson Bowman Acme continues to improve and enhance the performance, preservation and installation of bridge expansion joints. Because of this constant drive to improve, restore integrity and ensure serviceability, there is a wide selection of expansion joint systems from which an owner, engineer/architect or contractor may select.
In addition to new construction, Watson Bowman Acme also provides products and services targeted toward Bridge Maintenance which include high performance, easily installed, solutions that replace and or repair existing non-performing joints and headers. We also provide products that support the latest trend of Bridge Preservation - those activities performed on bridge elements or components that aim to prevent, delay, or reduce deterioration.
These products and services combined with our customer service and technical sales team, provides our customers with world-class solutions expected of a BASF company.
