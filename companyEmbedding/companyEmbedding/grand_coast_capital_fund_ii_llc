Grand Coast Capital Fund Surpasses $20M


BWW News Desk

November 06, 2014


 Boston, MA  Grand Coast Capital Group, a real estate lending and investment firm based in Boston, MA, continues to attract support from investors interested in tapping into the underserved small balance real estate sector. The Firm announced their first investment vehicle, a proprietary real estate fund, Grand Coast Capital Fund I, LLC ("the Fund") has raised over $20M in investment capital since inception in late 2013.
"There is a strong demand for private lenders at the small end of the market we serve, and we are thrilled, through the support of our investors, to be able to provide a consistent capital source for our borrower base," CEO Jeff Carter commented. Grand Coast has originated over 60 loans nationwide totaling over $30M since inception, and expects to double this production in 2015.
"I believe the success of our fundraise to date is attributed to the consistent track record we have been able to deliver our investors and our proven successful investment strategy. We are able to generate attractive current returns to our investors, with the additional security of holding 1st position liens on the real estate at less than 70% loan-to-value (LTV)" says Carter. 
Recent trends have shown a migration towards the small balance real estate private lending sector, however the firm remains disciplined in its strategy and long term approach to the market. Randy Winters, VP of Asset Valuation at Grand Coast says, "The influx of players in the space has led to some aggressive pricing and terms, however we remain focused on capital preservation and risk management. We have built a strong network of borrowers and offer them a professional relationship with dependable capital and a quick turnaround to close. In return our deal flow pipeline is robust and the quality of loans we are providing are not compromised." 
Carter spent two years researching and creating Grand Coast Capital and the Fund, before its launch in 2013. The capital raised to date is made up predominately from U.S. retail investors including high net worth individuals and single family offices. The Fund is structured as an open-ended fund for accredited investors.
