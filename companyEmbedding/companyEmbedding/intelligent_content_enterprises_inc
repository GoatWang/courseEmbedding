Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read and understood Investing.com Canada's comment guidlines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

Intelligent Content Enterprises Inc.



01/11/2017 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 01/11/2017 09:39
Intelligent Content Enterprises Corporate Update









TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / December 14, 2016 / INTELLIGENT CONTENT ENTERPRISES INC. (OTCQB: ICEIF, CSE: ISP) ('ICE' or the 'Company') is pleased to provide an update regarding its acquisition of the assets of Digital Widget Factory Inc., a Belize company and a general corporate update.
      

Claim under Acquisition Agreement


        As disclosed in the Company's press release of March 4, 2016 announcing completion of the acquisition (the 'Acquisition') of the assets of Digital Widget Factory Inc. (the 'Acquired Assets'), half of the shares of the Company paid to the vendor group as consideration for the Acquired Assets, or a total of 6,250,000 common shares and 2,875,000 preferred shares of the Company (the 'Escrowed Shares') are being held in escrow for a period of one year as security for indemnities provided by the vendor to ICE pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement governing the escrow of the Escrowed Shares, ICE has provided notice to the vendor group and the escrow agent of the Escrowed Shares of a claim for indemnity under the acquisition agreement. ICE has received a written response from the vendor group and the parties are engaged in ongoing discussions in efforts to resolve matters. As a result of the foregoing, the Company is not able at this time to determine the impact, if any, on the consideration paid under the Acquisition, and any resulting changes required to be made in the Company's financial statements. The Company has also suspended the consulting services of a consultant associated with the Acquired Assets and the vendor group that it engaged shortly following completion of the Acquisition.
      

Corporate Update


        While the Company's strategy continues to be to drive revenues through technologies and services that deliver Content, Social and Digital Media, eCommerce and Advertising, management consistently reviews ways to improve its content and user experience. In continuing to develop and refine its online presence, and after engaging in a strategic review of its costs, markets, and internal processes in an ongoing effort to engage users and efficiently build its user base, the Company announces:
      


          ICE has abridged the translation feature on its platform and is now no longer translating its websites in 67 different languages. Instead, the Company is focussing on distributing content on its websites in 3 principal languages being English, Spanish, and French utilizing a licenced technology translation service.
        

          Further to the Company's press releases of earlier this year, the Company announces that it is no longer pursuing negotiations to license and potentially acquire all of the technology, production and client operations of New York-based Catch Star Studios LLC., which includes its Clix Video and ongoing Stars and Pinstripes productions.
        

          In connection with its ongoing review of its platform and services, ICE has entered into a new master services agreement with a third-party provider, Torinit Technologies Inc., which management believes will provide ICE with improved quality of service at a fraction of the cost previously charged to the Company for similar services. Torinit Technologies Inc. is a Canadian company with facilities in India and is owned by a current director of ICE.
        

          The Company has closed a private placement financing for gross proceeds to the Company of $50,000 through the issuance of 76,923 units of the Company at a price of $0.65 per unit. Each unit is comprised of one (1) common share in the capital of the Company and one (1) common share purchase warrant entitling the holder to purchase one (1) common share at an exercise price of $1.00 for a period of three years from the date of issuance.

07/26/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 07/26/2016 12:13
Intelligent Content Enterprises and Catch Star Studios Launch Commercial Interactive “Click Video” Platform Clix.Video(TM)









NEW YORK, NY and TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / July 26, 2016 / INTELLIGENT CONTENT ENTERPRISES INC. (OTCQB 'ICEIF') ('ICE' or the 'Corporation'), is pleased to announce that together with its proposed license and prospective acquisition partner, Catch Star Studios, LLC. ('Catch Star Studios'), the team is officially launching Clix.Video™ (www.catchstarstudios.com and www.clix.video) allowing brands, creators and distributors of online video the ability to empower click to view, share and shopping abilities directly into their media to increase user engagement, conversions and revenue activities. Clix.Video™ can be localized for potentially any major global market both by offer and in the user's native language.
      

        Clix.Video™ enables digital and mobile viewers to instantly connect to web and mobile sites by clicking on custom interactive tags within digital videos. Clix.Video™ allows viewers to make social media connections, view extra and exclusive content as well as make online and mobile purchases. All user interactions are made directly via the HTML5 video broadcast, providing a richer, deeper consumer experience related to the video content.
      

        In a February 2016 report, eMarketer provided data showing that the US digital video advertising market alone is on pace to nearly double by 2019. Video advertising was $7.46 Billion for 2015, with 2016 expected to reach $9.59 Billion, with advertising growth reaching $14.77 Billion by 2019.
      

        Catch Star Studios has added proprietary marketing and technology layers to its Clix.Video™ platform, allowing multi-lingual closed captioning, unique overlay technologies and analytics, creating customized video viewing experiences for the individual user based on localization, offers and viewer language, ultimately leading to potential one to one experiences between the advertiser and the user.
      

        'Essentially, Clix.Video™ is a turnkey platform that makes online or mobile video transactional, allowing viewers to interact with an item that catches their interest within the video. They just simply click on the custom icons that move with that item as the video plays, giving them the opportunity to learn more, share it with others or buy it - instantly, and in almost any language,' said Mr. Joe Violone, President of Catch Star Studios. 'Clix.Video™ turns a digital video into an informational, social or revenue event on a local, national or global basis. Clix.Video™ potentially creates an individual experience between the video, brand and user, catered to the viewer's individual interests, likes, social media and shopping patterns.'
      

        The Huffington Post reported in a January 2016 article that in April of 2015, it was unveiled that over 4 billion videos were being played back each day on the Facebook platform alone. By September 2015, this number had doubled to a staggering 8 billion video views per day. Cisco now predicts that 80% of all Internet traffic will be streaming video content by 2019, up from 64% in 2014.
      

        Currently, as part of its launch program, Catch Star Studios is developing initial pilot programs with leading sports, apparel and entertainment clients. The technology will debut as part of its original series Stars and PinStripes featuring an elite cast of today's iconic and inspirational celebrities from all walks of life sharing their personal New York Yankees and life experiences and scheduled to air in August to approximately 12 million households on the YES Network nationwide as well as globally via online and mobile devices through ICE's Digital Widget Factory platform at www.digiwidgy.com. Show segments will also be available on www.YESNetwork.com.
      

        On May 25, 2016, ICE announced that it had reached an initial agreement to license to acquire all the technology, production and client operations owned and operated by New York based Catch Star Studios LLC ('Catch Star Studios') which is now anticipated to be closing in the coming month of August.
      

        On June 29, 2016, Catch Star Studios and ICE Studio Productions Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE, announced that the group has signed an agreement with the YES Network to its original programming series, Stars and PinStripes, beginning in August.
      

        This new and original series, Stars and PinStripes will be hosted by Nancy Newman, Emmy award winning YES Network studio host and also the host of the network's Yankees Magazine show. An original 30-minute episode is scheduled to premiere each month on YES beginning in August.
      

        Catch Star Studios is currently reviewing additional sports and celebrity original programming opportunities to provide rich, broadcast and digital strategies that support interactive video and multi-lingual global user engagement.
      

About Catch Star Studios, LLC


        Catch Star Studios provides original programming, distribution, development services, management and technologies that creates new and enables existing sport and other branded content to be consumed globally through traditional and online media channels.

Shares of Intelligent Content Enterprises Inc. (OTCQB: ICEIF) are up 4% on heavy volume on May 26, 2016. The internet and media company saw nearly 127,500 shares exchange hands or dollar volumes of $251,250 within the first few hours of trading.
Intelligent Content Enterprises Inc. (OTCQB: ICEIF) is not accustomed to seeing strong volume, as the $106 million dollar company has seen average daily volume come in around 52,100 over the past three months.
However, shares are active today after the company announced it had entered into an agreement with Catch Star Studios LLC to purchase their sports brand content and technology operations. Here is the press release detailing of the recent acquisition:
TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / May 25, 2016 / INTELLIGENT CONTENT ENTERPRISES INC. (OTCQB: ICEIF) (“ICE” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that ICE has signed a Term Sheet to license to acquire all the technology, production and client operations owned and operated by New York based Catch Star Studios LLC (“Catch Star Studios”).
Catch Star Studios provides development services, management and technologies that creates new and enables existing sport and other branded content to be consumed globally through traditional and online media channels. Catch Star Studios also develops and executes world class engagement initiatives enabling brands to extend global video content, reach advertising and direct revenue opportunities through Catch Star Studios’ proprietary “in video” marketing platform.
Earlier this week, Reelseo.com reported 29 Big Online Video Marketing Statistics That Media Brands Need to Know which followed a number of key announcements by major media during the 2016 Digital Media NewFronts meetings earlier this month. Key stats include: 68% of marketers believe that original digital video content will be as important as original TV programming in the next 3 years and in 2016, more video content will be uploaded in 30 days than all three major US TV networks combined have created in 30 years.
ICE and Catch Star Studios are working on a number of major content projects with leading sports brands to create new content to increase brand awareness, engage fans for apparel, memorabilia and other merchandise programs and allow sponsors to create not only primary, branded video content, but secondary and tertiary engagement through a single watch video strategy, allowing them to extend their reach beyond the viewing of video through a number of channels, including global media and ICE’s Digital Widget Factory (“DWF”) platform (www.digiwidgy.com).
Under the terms of the Term Sheet, to which definitive agreements to memorialize the terms and conditions are currently underway and expected to close within 30 days, ICE will initially license and manage all of the projects of Catch Star Studios with the agreement being effective as of May 2016. As consideration for the transaction, ICE will issue up to 2.7 Million, three year, common share purchase warrants at an exercise price of approximately $1.30 CDN ($1.00 USD) (“Warrants”) which are earned by Catch Star Studios on a performance basis over the next 4 years with ICE receiving corresponding equity and potentially up to 100% equity in Catch Star Studios as the Warrants are earned and vested thereby creating an ongoing transfer of equity in Catch Star Studios to ICE. No assurances can be provided that the definitive agreements will be finalized and if finalized, Warrants will be earned, vested or exercised.
In a 2014 article by Reelseo.com, citing an Animoto survey revealed that video has an extraordinarily positive impact on consumers during the purchase life-cycle, and in driving brand awareness and engagement. It was reported that 73% of those surveyed confirmed that they are more likely to buy a product or sign up for a service if they watch a branded video that explains the product. Further to the survey, the same article provided insight from Cisco that stated that by 2019, 80% of the world’s Internet traffic will be video.
“The Catch Star Studios relationship is a key program that enables ICE to directly participate in the global major sports and digital video marketing arena with leading creative, technology and engagement revenue solutions content distribution and viewership,” said Mr. James Cassina, President and CEO of ICE. “In combination with our acquisition of the DWF platform and its technology, we are now leveraging that platform and its ability to globalize content, including video and user engagement, into viable commercial transactions world-wide.”
Through its proprietary intelligent content technology, ICE’s DWF platform evaluates user engagement and site follow through and based on those assessments recommends which content channels achieve the popularity standards of a stand-alone DWF site and then recommends their launch to the expanding portfolio of DWF websites and can “push” content, including video throughout the portfolio.
