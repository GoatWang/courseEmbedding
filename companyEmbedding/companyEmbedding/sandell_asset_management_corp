Meaning of Castlerigg
The name “Castlerigg” refers to a stone formation of a sacred alignment in England, near Keswick, where stands a circle consisting of 38 stones erected circa 3200 BC. All around the world, ruins of such ancient civilizations demonstrate an intimate knowledge of global events and their aftermath. In fact, at Castlerigg, leading archeoastronomers have found a total of seven solar and lunar alignments at the site, a feat that would today require the use of extensive manpower and sophisticated equipment to replicate.

MLIS Castlerigg Equity Event and Arbitrage UCITS Fund

			PLEASE BE ADVISED that it has come to our attention that a fraudulent website has been created which is misrepresenting the name of Castlerigg UCITS Fund plc.  The website http://www.castlerigginvestments.com is NOT affiliated with any of Sandell Asset Management Corp.’s Castlerigg investment products, and has been identified as a scam.  See https://www.scamwarners.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&p=255706.
			
			As of March 2014, Castlerigg UCITS Fund plc merged onto a Luxembourg UCITS platform, and has since received its Notice of Revocation of Authorization from the Central Bank of Ireland and is currently in liquidation.
		




Fund Description
Launched in October, 2010, the Castlerigg Merger Arbitrage and Equity Event UCITS Fund (an Irish authorized UCITS fund, IN LIQUIDATION), was formed to invest in equity special situations such as restructurings, recapitalizations and spinoffs, and merger arbitrage, including announced mergers, hostile and unsolicited transactions. The Fund's objective was to attain consistent capital growth over time, largely independent of market movements. In an effort to meet this objective, the Fund’s strategy is to seek to produce consistent, positive returns with low downside volatility. Capital has been allocated opportunistically and is totally fluid, resulting in ever-changing geographical exposures and strategy allocations within the firm's defined specialties.
As of 14-March 2014, Castlerigg UCITS Fund plc (the “Fund”) merged onto a Luxembourg UCITS platform, and is now available as the Merrill Lynch Investment Solutions – Castlerigg Equity Event and Arbitrage UCITS Fund.  The investment strategy and objectives of the Fund remain the same.  Details regarding Merrill Lynch Investment Solutions and the Fund are available at www.funds-invest.baml.com.

UK Reporting Funds Report
The Castlerigg Merger Arbitrage and Equity Event UCITS Fund (the “Castlerigg UCITS Fund”) is no longer available for direct investment. The information provided by following the link above is posted as part of continuing regulatory obligations, and does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to purchase, any interest in the Castlerigg UCITS Fund or any other investment product.

MLIS Castlerigg Equity Event and Arbitrage UCITS Fund

			PLEASE BE ADVISED that it has come to our attention that a fraudulent website has been created which is misrepresenting the name of Castlerigg UCITS Fund plc.  The website http://www.castlerigginvestments.com is NOT affiliated with any of Sandell Asset Management Corp.’s Castlerigg investment products, and has been identified as a scam.  See https://www.scamwarners.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&p=255706.
			
			As of March 2014, Castlerigg UCITS Fund plc merged onto a Luxembourg UCITS platform, and has since received its Notice of Revocation of Authorization from the Central Bank of Ireland and is currently in liquidation.
		




Fund Description
Launched in October, 2010, the Castlerigg Merger Arbitrage and Equity Event UCITS Fund (an Irish authorized UCITS fund, IN LIQUIDATION), was formed to invest in equity special situations such as restructurings, recapitalizations and spinoffs, and merger arbitrage, including announced mergers, hostile and unsolicited transactions. The Fund's objective was to attain consistent capital growth over time, largely independent of market movements. In an effort to meet this objective, the Fund’s strategy is to seek to produce consistent, positive returns with low downside volatility. Capital has been allocated opportunistically and is totally fluid, resulting in ever-changing geographical exposures and strategy allocations within the firm's defined specialties.
As of 14-March 2014, Castlerigg UCITS Fund plc (the “Fund”) merged onto a Luxembourg UCITS platform, and is now available as the Merrill Lynch Investment Solutions – Castlerigg Equity Event and Arbitrage UCITS Fund.  The investment strategy and objectives of the Fund remain the same.  Details regarding Merrill Lynch Investment Solutions and the Fund are available at www.funds-invest.baml.com.
Central Bank of Ireland Notice of Revocation of Authorization
UK Reporting Funds Report
The Castlerigg Merger Arbitrage and Equity Event UCITS Fund (the “Castlerigg UCITS Fund”) is no longer available for direct investment. The information provided by following the link above is posted as part of continuing regulatory obligations, and does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to purchase, any interest in the Castlerigg UCITS Fund or any other investment product.

Sandell Releases Letter to the Board of Directors of Bob Evans | Business Wire
























































Sandell Releases Letter to the Board of Directors of Bob Evans




Large, Long-Time Shareholder Calls Upon Company to Retain Financial 
      Advisor to Explore Alternatives for BEF Foods and Bob Evans Restaurants 
      in Order to Enhance Shareholder Value


Investor Notes Strategic Buyer’s Current Interest in BEF Foods; 
      Valuation for BEF Foods May Exceed $950 million






December 03, 2015 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sandell Asset Management Corp. (“Sandell”) today publicly released the 
      following letter sent to the Board of Directors of Bob Evans Farms, Inc. 
      (“Bob Evans” or the “Company”):
    

      December 2, 2015
    

      The Board of DirectorsBob Evans Farms, Inc.8111 Smith’s Mill 
      RoadNew Albany, Ohio 43054Attention: Colin Daly, Corporate 
      Secretary
    

      Ladies and Gentlemen:
    

      As you know, we are one of the largest shareholders of Bob Evans, and 
      have been for some time. We are pleased with a number of steps that the 
      Board of Directors (the “Board”) and Finance Committee have taken since 
      last year to inject a newly-invigorated culture of accountability and 
      excellence at the Company. Hopefully our November 10 letter to the Board 
      was helpful in outlining our concerns regarding the status of the very 
      real expression of interest in BEF Foods that had been previously 
      conveyed by a motivated and highly-sophisticated industry participant, 
      Post Holdings Inc. (“Post”).
    

      To recap, we have been told by knowledgeable sources that Post had 
      expressed an interest in pursuing a transaction with Bob Evans involving 
      its packaged foods business, BEF Foods, within the last year. 
      Furthermore, we understand that Post has a continuing, strong interest 
      in pursuing a transaction with Bob Evans involving BEF Foods, and has 
      the ability to creatively structure a transaction in a manner that could 
      reduce or eliminate the tax consequences to Bob Evans. Note that Post is 
      a publicly-traded company with a market value in excess of $4.5 billion 
      that could use both cash and stock as acquisition currency, as well as 
      one or more underlying business units such as Michael Foods that could 
      serve to facilitate the formation of a joint venture or other such 
      arrangement with BEF Foods.
    

      Based on the Company’s recent Fiscal 2016 second quarter results along 
      with various analyst estimates, it appears that BEF Foods may generate 
      somewhere in the vicinity of $68 million in EBITDA this year, and we 
      note that this figure is after the 
      allocation of what we believe may be about $15 million of corporate 
      overhead. Thus, BEF Foods may generate approximately $83 million in 
      EBITDA before the allocation of corporate overhead, a figure much more 
      relevant to a strategic industry participant. Based on that amount, we 
      believe that the value that a strategic buyer could ascribe to BEF Foods 
      may greatly exceed the entire market 
      value of Bob Evans, which at an approximate stock price of $40 per share 
      is about $855 million. Indeed, Hormel is trading at close to 15.0x 
      EBITDA, and there have been two transactions in the last year and a half 
      involving companies comparable to BEF Foods, namely Hillshire Brands and 
      Applegate Farms, that were effected at multiples estimated at 16.7x and 
      18.0x EBITDA, respectively. It is not 
      unrealistic to assume that BEF Foods could command a value in excess of 
      $950 million.
    

      Currently, an approximate $40 stock price implies an enterprise value to 
      Bob Evans of about $1.32 billion, assuming an $855 million market value 
      and $469 million of net debt. Assuming a value for BEF Foods of $950 
      million leads to the truly shocking conclusion that investors are 
      ascribing a value to the Bob Evans Restaurant business of about $370 
      million. This is less than half of the 
      approximate $800 million in value that could be ascribed solely 
      to the Company’s owned restaurant real estate. Bob Evans is being 
      punished by maintaining combined ownership of both its Restaurant and 
      BEF Foods business.
    

      We had a robust discussion with the members of the Finance Committee 
      last week where we noted our strong desire to see the Company engage a 
      new financial advisor so that it could assess the various alternatives 
      that Bob Evans could pursue to enhance shareholder value, and 
      particularly tax-efficient alternatives relating to the separation of 
      BEF Foods and/or Bob Evans Restaurants. We were therefore understandably 
      disappointed that the Company made no reference to the retention of a 
      new financial advisor in either its recent earnings release or 
      associated conference call. While we do not know if the entire Board of 
      Directors was fully informed of our views expressed to the Finance 
      Committee, to be certain we are sending this correspondence to the 
      entire Board.
    

      While there is a compelling industrial logic to separating BEF Foods, 
      the Company must also be mindful of tax issues and we fully understand 
      the complexity that may be involved in planning such a business 
      separation. This is all the more reason to now retain an independent, 
      nationally-recognized investment banking firm to explore the numerous 
      options available to Bob Evans in order that it may develop a 
      fully-informed plan. Furthermore, the timing to effect a separation of 
      BEF Foods is ideal, particularly considering that the Company recently 
      announced that it has named Saed Mohseni as CEO and President effective 
      as of January 1, 2016. While Mr. Mohseni does not appear to have an 
      extensive food products background, he has an enormous wealth of 
      restaurant experience which will be of great value as he seeks to 
      enhance the Bob Evans Restaurant business. His efforts to re-position 
      the Bob Evans Restaurant business for greatness should not be distracted 
      by the continued presence of BEF Foods.
    

      It continues to be our strong contention that the intrinsic value of Bob 
      Evans is far greater than the value implied by its current stock price 
      and, given the dramatic uptick in valuations in the packaged foods 
      space, we believe that the ultimate separation of BEF Foods and/or Bob 
      Evans Restaurants would serve to narrow what we believe is this 
      draconian discount to intrinsic value. We therefore believe that now is 
      the time for the entire Board of Directors to take prompt action to 
      address this issue. As always, we would be pleased to discuss these and 
      other matters with you in greater detail at your convenience.
    

      Sincerely,

Sandell Sends Letter to Viavi Solutions Inc.




Seeks Strategic Review to Maximize Value of Company’s Net Operating 
      Losses (NOLs) and Reverse History of Poor Governance and Performance


Sees Value of Over $10 per Share in Sale of Company; Transition to 
      Platform Company may Deliver Over $12 per Share of Value


Sandell Prepared to Nominate Slate of Director Candidates for 2015 
      Annual Meeting






September 01, 2015 09:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sandell Asset Management Corp. and its affiliates (“Sandell”), the 
      beneficial owner of approximately 12.0 million shares, or 5.1%(1), 
      of Viavi Solutions Inc. (“Viavi” or the “Company”, and formerly JDS 
      Uniphase Corporation) (NASDAQ:VIAV), today sent a letter to the 
      Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”).
    


      In the letter, Sandell outlines a number of actions it believes the 
      Company must undertake in order to enhance value and reverse the poor 
      governance and performance that has plagued its shareholders. These 
      actions include:
    


        Refreshing and materially enhancing the quality of Viavi’s Board of 
        Directors;
      

        Conducting a thorough review of strategic alternatives;
      

        Retaining an independent financial advisor and operational consulting 
        firm; and
      

        Identifying a new management team with the experience necessary to 
        maximize the value of the Company’s deferred tax assets, which include 
        its $4 billion to $4.5 billion of federal net operating losses (NOLs).
      


      Sandell believes that such a strategic review should include the 
      exploration of alternatives for the NSE and OSP business as well as 
      Viavi as a whole. Sandell believes that shareholders could receive 
      over $10 per share in value if Viavi was sold in its entirely, while a 
      value in excess of $12 per share could be realized if the Company were 
      to transition itself into a tax-advantaged “platform company.” 
      Examples of publicly-traded “platform companies” or acquisition vehicles 
      include Jarden Corporation (NYSE:JAH), Platform Specialty Products 
      Corporation (NYSE:PAH), and Nomad Foods Limited (LSE:NHL), and the 
      Company should seek to identify a CEO with the background needed to 
      reposition Viavi as such a company.
    

      Sandell has identified a number of outstanding, potential Board members 
      and is prepared to nominate a competing slate of Director candidates for 
      the Company’s 2015 Annual Meeting - though it would be Sandell’s 
      preference to reach an amicable resolution that would avoid the need for 
      a contentious proxy battle. Sandell had engaged in good faith dialogue 
      with Viavi in the very recent past but was not able to enter into a 
      settlement agreement due to certain conditions that the Company sought 
      to impose. Sandell believes that the nomination window to submit 
      candidates for the Board of Directors of Viavi opens on September 6.
    

      The text of the letter is as follows:
    

      September 1, 2015
    

      The Board of DirectorsViavi Solutions Inc.430 North McCarthy 
      BoulevardMilpitas, CA 95035
    

      Attention: Richard E. Belluzzo, Chairman and Interim CEOc/o Kevin 
      Siebert, Secretary
    

      Dear Rick:
    

      As you know, Sandell Asset Management Corp. (“Sandell”) is a significant 
      shareholder of Viavi Solutions Inc. (“Viavi” or the “Company”, and 
      formerly JDS Uniphase Corporation), with current beneficial ownership of 
      approximately 12.0 million shares, or 5.1%(1), of the 
      Company. While we appreciate the previous dialogue that my colleague 
      Richard Mansouri and I have had with you and other Company 
      representatives over the last few months, as well as the diligent, good 
      faith efforts that we had put into recent settlement discussions, our 
      firm could not in good conscience enter into a settlement agreement with 
      Viavi unless such agreement provided for meaningful, comprehensive 
      change at the Company. This was particularly important given the 
      Company’s history of what we believe to be troubling governance 
      practices, poor operating results, and truly abhorrent stock price 
      performance. Furthermore, certain conditions that you sought to impose 
      upon us were far from standard and in fact highly offensive.
    

      Along with the recent release of Viavi’s Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Year 
      End 2015 results, we learned that CEO Thomas Waechter is leaving the 
      Company. While we harbor no personal animosity toward Mr. Waechter, we 
      view this development as a unique opportunity for the Company to finally 
      take the steps necessary to deliver value to its long-suffering 
      shareholders. It is in fact noteworthy that in our settlement 
      discussions, Viavi had insisted that Mr. Waechter maintain his role of 
      CEO. We fear that the exit of Mr. Waechter, as well as the Company’s 
      apparent newly-found desire to add two new directors, reflects an 
      insufficient attempt at meaningful change.
    

      From our settlement discussions, you should be aware that we have 
      identified a number of truly outstanding candidates for the Board of 
      Directors. Furthermore, we have made it very clear that the ultimate 
      composition of the Board is but one component of what must be a sweeping 
      improvement in the overall governance and management of the Company, 
      which would include a thorough re-evaluation of the Company’s strategic 
      alternatives, the retention of a new financial advisor and operational 
      consulting firm, and the identification of a new management team capable 
      of extracting value from the Company’s deferred tax assets relating to 
      its multi-billion dollar balance of federal, state, and foreign net 
      operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). It is this last point that merits 
      further discussion, as we are astonished by the Company’s apparent 
      failure to understand the potential value of such tax assets, 
      notwithstanding very recent comments from CFO Rex Jackson that Viavi 
      possesses between $4 billion to $4.5 billion 
      of federal NOLs alone.
    

      From a “big picture” perspective, the value ascribed to NOLs is related 
      to the amount and timing of pre-tax income that such NOLs can shield 
      from tax. To put it another way, the utilization and thus value of a 
      company’s NOLs increases as the amount of pre-tax income generated by 
      such company increases. Moreover, the faster this income is generated, 
      the more quickly that these NOLs can be utilized and hence the higher 
      the present value afforded to them. Until we made our thoughts regarding 
      Viavi publicly known in October of 2014, there had been next to no 
      mention of the potential value of the Company’s NOLs. Even now, as 
      recently as the Company’s August 11 Fiscal Fourth Quarter conference 
      call, the vague comments made by Viavi suggest that the Board has little 
      idea how to maximize the value of these tax assets. As Chairman of the 
      Board and interim CEO, you may recall that your exact comments on the 
      conference call were, “I think we have more work to do on NOLs, clearly 
      it’s a big number,” which does not exactly suggest a robust grasp of the 
      topic nor an urgency to address it.
    

      In our informed opinion, the method by which Viavi could generate 
      maximum value from its vast balance of NOLs is to transition itself into 
      what is known as a “platform company.” There are at least three 
      publicly-traded platform companies, or acquisition vehicles, that have 
      generated a wide following in the investment community, namely Jarden, 
      Platform Specialty Products, and Nomad Foods, due in large part to the 
      acumen demonstrated by their management teams and boards of directors, 
      and we should note that none of these companies possessed any meaningful 
      tax assets to speak of. We contrast this with Viavi, whose operational 
      history, in our opinion, has been nothing short of disastrous. Its 
      much-hyped attempt to transition to a software-centric business through 
      the expensive and destructive build-out of its SE segment has cost 
      hundreds of millions of dollars and has saddled the Company with 
      significant and recurring operating losses. With the departure of Thomas 
      Waechter, the Company now has the ability to conduct a far-reaching 
      search in order to identify an executive with the background needed to 
      reposition Viavi as a tax-advantaged platform company. In the interim, 
      Viavi must retain an operational consulting firm such as Alvarez & 
      Marsal in order to identify and eliminate the many excess costs that we 
      believe are plaguing the Company.
    

      Along with the need to identify a new CEO is the desperate need for the 
      Company to conduct a dispassionate review of strategic alternatives. The 
      Board appears to still cling to the belief that Viavi should continue to 
      be in the test and measurement business, notwithstanding the 
      consolidation taking place in this space and what we believe to be the 
      lack of operational competence demonstrated by the Company. At minimum, 
      Viavi should explore the sale of the NSE segment to any of a number of 
      other larger companies, such as Keysight Technologies, Inc. (KEYS), who 
      we believe would be able to wring substantial savings out of such a 
      business. In a similar manner, a strategic review of the Company’s 
      highly-profitable OSP segment should be undertaken, as we do not believe 
      that Viavi’s stock price reflects the potential value that a 
      knowledgeable third party would ascribe to such a business. Moreover, 
      the contribution of the OSP business to Viavi is being obscured by the 
      poor performance of the NSE business and the inordinately high corporate 
      overhead present at the Company. To conduct such a review, we believe 
      the Company must hire a new and truly independent financial advisor, 
      un-tainted by previous dealings with the Company, in order to conduct a 
      comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for both the OSP and the 
      NSE business as well as options for Viavi as a whole.
    

      Despite all the concern for “value” that various Company representatives 
      have professed, we fear that the Board has little understanding of what 
      “value” means to the institutional community. Quite simply, the “value” 
      of a publicly-traded company is measured by such company’s stock price, 
      and by this metric we find that the Board has overseen a truly shocking 
      erosion of value. By our approximate calculations, the value of Viavi 
      may easily be between 85% and 122% higher than its existing share price, 
      as is illustrated below:

      * In the “Section 382” case, the annual use of NOLs is limited to the 
      long-term tax-exempt rate multiplied by the ex-NOL value of Viavi. In 
      the “Platform” case, Viavi is assumed to make acquisitions for total 
      consideration equal to the ex-NOL value of Viavi plus an equivalent 
      amount of leverage at an acquisition price of 15x pre-tax income, 
      financed 50/50 cash and debt, with annual NOL use equal to pre-tax 
      income less 4.5% interest expense on incremental debt. Both cases 
      discount 20 years of annual tax savings at an assumed 35% tax rate and a 
      7% discount rate.
    

      We highlight the fact that we approximate the Company’s tax assets in 
      two ways, the first being the most draconian method, which assumes that 
      Viavi is sold in its entirety to another acquirer, in which case the 
      Company’s NOLs would be subject to a Section 382 limitation. Even in 
      this draconian scenario, we believe that shareholders could realize a 
      value of $10.25, which is 85% higher than its current price. The other 
      method assumes that the Company monetizes its underlying business 
      segments and transitions to a tax-advantaged platform company in which 
      Viavi utilizes these proceeds plus the Company’s existing cash and 
      investments along with incremental leverage to pursue an acquisition or 
      series of acquisitions of profitable businesses. We believe this 
      alternative could yield a value of $12.32, which is 122% higher than the 
      current price.
    

      In order to take these critical and necessary steps to deliver enhanced 
      value to the shareholders of Viavi, the Company must have a Board 
      consisting of truly objective individuals with a deep knowledge of 
      complex financial matters as well as a fulsome understanding of the 
      public markets. Furthermore, we have no confidence whatsoever that the 
      Company’s purported search for two new directors will result in the 
      addition of members who will be able to offset the collective inertia 
      that we believe pervades the existing Board.
    

      As you are aware, the nomination window to submit candidates for the 
      Board of Directors of Viavi opens on September 6 and we are prepared to 
      submit a competing slate of Director candidates for the 2015 Annual 
      Meeting. That said, it remains our preference to reach an amicable 
      resolution that would avoid the need to embark upon a costly, 
      distracting, and no doubt highly-contentious proxy battle. If you are 
      willing to enter into good faith discussions with a view towards 
      reaching a fair settlement agreement, we ask that your counsel contact 
      Marc Weingarten of Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP at (212) 756-2000 as soon as 
      possible.
    

      Sincerely,
