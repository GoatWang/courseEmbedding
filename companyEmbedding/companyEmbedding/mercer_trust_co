One of the largest defined contribution investment consultants, globally.
Over 2,100 investment professionals across the globe.



RESEARCH & DUE DILIGENCE, PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, AND OVERSIGHT

1. Assets under advisement includes aggregated data for Mercer Trust Company and its affiliated companies globally (“Mercer”). Data is derived from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, third-party custodians or investment managers, regulatory filings, and client self-reported data. Mercer has not independently verified the data. Where available, data is provided as of December 31, 2016 (“Reporting Date”). If data was not available as of the Reporting Date, information from a date closest in time to the Reporting Date, which may be of a more recent date than the Reporting Date, was included. Data includes assets of clients that have engaged Mercer to provide project-based services within the 12-month period ending on the Reporting Date, and assets of clients that subscribe to Mercer’s Manager Research database.
2. Assets of multi-manager Funds are allocated to different investment managers, acting independently from the others based on their own investment style. Generally, Mercer Trust Company will use a multi-manager Fund structure; however, certain asset classes may not lend themselves to multi-manager solutions. As a result, each Fund will be separately analyzed to find the best investment solution.
